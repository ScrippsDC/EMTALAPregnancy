I.  Medical Staff Policies ... C.  Transfer Orders.  3. To Other Healthcare Facility. ... No patient who presents with an emergency medical condition (including a woman in labor) shall be transferred who has not received ... appropriate stabilization.\"    \\n\\nReview, at approximately 1:23 PM on August 30, 2016, of Policy #101.18, EMTALA Compliance Plan, effective December 2, 2009, revealed, \"... Warren General Hospital shall comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) and all other federal and state laws governing the treatment of persons with emergency medical conditions. ... If the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital with either (i) provide any necessary stabilizing treatment, or (ii) transfer the individual to another facility, or (iii) admit the patient for inpatient or observation services. ... The medical record must reflect continued monitoring, according to the individual\\'s needs, until it is determined whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition, and, if the individual has an emergency medical condition, until the individual is stabilized or appropriately transferred.  \\n\\nReview, at approximately 1:50 PM on August 30, 2016, of Policy #1207-d-R, Sexual Assault, revised December 9, 2005, revealed, \"Policy:  To provide victims of sexual assault with prompt, comprehensive, and professional treatment while respecting their need for privacy.  Procedure:  As soon after arrival as possible, a victim of sexual assault should be placed in a private examination room.  The screening nurse should take a brief history to the events of the assault. History should be limited to a very brief description of the events surrounding the assault including date, time and location of assault. Medical history per screening policy #1202-R should be obtained. Patients should be screened for any injuries needing emergency treatment. ... Any individual who identifies herself/himself as a victim of sexual assault that occurred within the previous 120 hours should be asked if she/he wishes to be seen by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE). If the patient refuses, the ECC physician will see that patient.  Patients identified with need for emergency treatment for injuries received as a result of a sexual assault will be evaluated by the ECC physician, initially.  The SANE nurse will perform a detailed history and forensic exam with the intent of collecting evidence under the auspices of the ECC physician, and will document all findings thoroughly. ... A careful assessment will be done with particular attention to the events prior to and during the assault, the time of assault, the clothing worn, and any bathing since the event. ... Specimens will be collected in conjunction with the guidelines of the Tri-Tech Sexual Assault Evidence Kit, or a suitable alternative.  After the examination is complete, all specimens are appropriately labeled, and the chain of evidence is transferred to the investigating officer.  Initial testing will include serum pregnancy test for any female of childbearing age.  Urine drug screen and Rohypnol testing may be done when appropriate.  The Pennsylvania Department of Health or the primary care physician should do testing for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, on follow-up within 2 weeks.  Preventative medical care will be provided through the offering of the following medication(s):  Ceftriaxone 125-250 mg IM in a single dose  Metronidazole 2 gm orally BID x 7 days  Doxycycline 100 mg orally BID x 7 days  Azithromycin 1 gm PO in a single dose  Cipro 500 mg PO in a single dose  Plan B one tablet PO STAT and repeat in 12 hours, if pregnancy test is negative  HIV prophylaxis at discretion of the SANE/ECC physician ...\"  \\n\\n1.  Review of MR1 revealed that the patient presented on   July 23, 2016, at 2:21 AM for an alleged sexual assault.  Review of the record revealed no documentation of a SANE assessment or internal examination of the patient.  The record further revealed no initial testing and preventative medical care as per facility policy.   \\n\\n2.  Review of the physician documentation revealed, \"EMERGENCY COURSE  Urinalysis was obtained as [MR1] had to urinate here in the ER.  I discussed the case with the [Tertiary Hospital] Nurse OTH4 and it was agreed the patient would be sent to [Tertiary Hospital] for evaluation by the SANE nurse on call tonight. ...\"  The documentation was electronically signed by EMP1 on July 23, 2016 at 3:38 AM.  \\n\\n3.  Between 8:50 AM and 9:30 AM on August 31, 2016, an interview was conducted with EMP10.  Upon identifying MR1 and asking about [his/her] recollection of the case, EMP10 stated, \"Vaguely.  I knew there was one [pediatric sexual assault case], but I don\\'t believe I was here.\"  EMP10 went on to stated, \"[EMP1] discussed the case with a [Tertiary Hospital] nurse. ... It was agreed that the patient would be sent to [Tertiary Hospital] to be seen by the SANE nurse on-call. ...\"  Upon reviewing the medical record, EMP10 stated, \"This patient, looks like [he/she] had a UA [urinalysis] and a culture.\"  When asked if there would typically have been testing for positivity of drugs and/or alcohol in the patient\\'s system, EMP10 stated, \"Generally, if it\\'s an adult, and the patient said someone slipped them something, yes, we do [tests for substances/alcohol].\"  When asked if it could have been possible that the patient in question could have been drugged by the perpetrator, EMP10 stated, \"Yeah, I suppose.\"  When asked if [he/she] could identify where any antibiotics and/or prophylactics were ordered for the patient, EMP10 stated, \"No, none of those were ordered.\"  EMP10 confirmed that those medications were available.  \\n\\n4.  Review of MR2 revealed that the patient presented on   February 6, 2016, for an alleged sexual assault.  On August 31, 2016, at approximately 9:08 AM, when asked what type of care was provided to this patient, EMP10 reviewed the medical record and stated, \"... Ok, discussion with prophylaxis against pregnancy and STI. ... check tetanus status, and if not within last five years, please update. ... They did the Hepatitis B and C and serum pregnancy test, and an HIV baseline.\"  EMP10 confirmed that lab testing was done and preventative care was arranged for the patient.  When asked if there was a policy or internal memo explaining how the ED was to function without a SANE nurse, EMP10 stated, \"I don\\'t know of revisions.\"  \\n\\n5.  Between 10:07 AM and 10:30 AM on August 31, 2016, a telephone interview was conducted with EMP1.  When asked about [his/her] recollection of the primary case [MR1], EMP1 stated, \"I remember it pretty well.  We don\\'t see many [age of the patient-pediatric] come through that get assaulted that often.\"  EMP1 confirmed that Warren no longer has SANE nurses.  EMP1 stated, \"I made sure [MR1] wasn\\'t significantly injured. ... vital signs, that kind of thing. ... If you were going to do the complete [exam], that\\'s what you would do [laboratory testing]. ... If you\\'re going to send them to the SANE nurse, that\\'s what they would do [laboratory testing]. ... In the ED, the SANE nurse has a protocol/policy that they follow.  There is an order on the [Health System for Tertiary Hospital] system that would include all of that stuff.  I\\'m not sure who exactly signs for that eventually.\"  When asked if the protocol/policy being referred to would be inclusive of antibiotics and/or prophylaxis, EMP1 stated, \"Yeah, there\\'s an entire order set that they collect and somebody signs off, it\\'s either the ED medical director or the physician on duty.\"  Regarding the primary case patient, EMP1 stated, \"I\\'m not sure that we did anything with [him/her].  We may have gotten a urine. ... I think [he/she] had to pee, so we got a urinalysis.\"  When asked what information, regarding the patient\\'s care at Warren, was conveyed to [Tertiary Hospital], EMP1 stated, \"My evaluation, ... I explained to the nurse that I did a brief external exam. ... I don\\'t think we sent a copy of the lab work, because I don\\'t think that we had it back.\"  EMP1 added, \"We took as good of care of that patient as we could. ... I\\'m confused as to why this has turned into an EMTALA investigation.\"    \\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  _x000d_\\n_x000d_\\nBased on medical record reviews, interviews, review of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor) Policies and Procedures, emergency room    Policies and Procedures, Wiregrass Medical Center, Hospital # 1, failed to provide a medical screening examination for Patient Identifier (PI) # 1, a patient who presented to the ED (emergency department) with complaints of \"Cramping, Bleeding, Pregnant,\" on 6/12/17.  Furthermore, the ER  RN (emergency room    Registered Nurse) told the patient (PI # 1) no obstetrical services were available at Hospital # 1 before offering a thorough triage assessment to PI # 1.  The RN also advised PI # 1 to go to Enterprise(the name of the city where Hospital # 2) is located.  These comments / \"suggestions\" by the RN contributed to the decision of PI # 1 to leave the ER  at Hospital # 1 without being thoroughly triaged or receiving a medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.   \\n\\nThis deficient practice effected PI #1, one of 32 ED sampled patients and had the potential to negatively impact other patients who present to Hospital #1\\'s Emergency Department with similar obstetrical symptoms. \\n\\nFinding include:\\n\\nI. Hospital # 1\\'s ER  Log dated 6/12/17 documented:\\n\\nPatient Identifier (PI) # 1\\'s Name. \\nAge: 28 years. \\nSex: F. \\nAttending Physician: name of EI (Employee Identifier) # 4 / ED Physician.   \\nStay Type: ER.\\nadmitted  /time: 6/12/2017  04:39.\\nAdmit Code: Emergency. \\ndischarge date   /Time: 6/12/2017  04:40.\\nMode of arrival: Ambulatory. \\nTriage Level: Patient left.\\nDisposition: AMA (Against Medical Advise).\\nDischarge Condition: Unknown.  \\nChief Complaint: Cramping, Bleeding, Pregnant.    \\n\\nII. ER  Triage / Physician Order Form: \\nNo vital signs were documented.  The RN\\'s (Registered Nurse) Employee Identifier (EI # 1\\'s )  name was documented on the form.  \\nPI # 1\\'s disposition was documented as LWBS (Left Without Being Seen).   \\nDate: 6/12/17\\nTime: 04:40 \\n\\n04:40: \"Patient (PI # 1) left without being seen. She decided to go on to Enterprise(name of town where Hospital # 2 is located) and see her OB-GYN\" (obstetrical and gynecological (physician).  Documented by EI # 1.    \\n\\nThere was no documentation of a Medical Screening Examination in PI # 1\\'s ER  medical record.     \\n\\nIII. Interviews\\n\\nInterview with EI # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1 on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58:\\n\\nDuring an interview on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58,  Employee Identifier (EI) # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) / ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1, verified she was on duty on 6/12/17 from 18:00-06:00.  EI # 1 confirmed she was responsible for the triage/interview with PI # 1 in the ED lobby. \\n\\nEI # 1 reported events of the ED activities related to Patient Identifier (PI # 1) which included registration with an Admission Clerk.  The clerk took PI # 1\\'s chart to the ED nurse\\'s station.  EI # 1, staff ED RN was told by the Admission Clerk a 27 week pregnant lady was in the ED lobby, with complaints of cramping and bleeding (vaginal). When the staff RN opened the ED lobby door, FI # 1, (Family Identifier), the grandmother who accompanied the patient, was screaming this into a cell phone, \"I\\'m just gonna take her to Enterprise.\"  EI # 1 confirmed no other patients were present in the ED lobby.\\n\\nDuring the ED lobby encounter with PI # 1, the staff RN (EI # 1) reported asking the patient (PI # 1),  \"How bad are you bleeding?\"  PI # 1 response, \"pretty bad.\"  \\n\\nEI # 1 then reported to the surveyors, \"I told PI # 1 like I tell all patients.  We\\'ll be glad to see you, have the doctor assess you and listen to the heart beat of the baby, but Wiregrass (Hospital # 1) does not have OB/GYN services.\"  EI # 1 reported asking PI # 1 where her OB physician was located?  PI # 1 reported Enterprise (name of the city where her obstetrician practices). \\n\\nEI # 1 reported PI # 1 was crying.  A family member was on the phone screaming, \"I\\'m just going to take her to Enterprise.\" \\n\\nEI # 1 reported telling the patient \"to sit still, I\\'m going to get the other nurse to help.\"  EI # 1 reported the patient\\'s response as she \"shook her head (in affirmation).\"\\nEI # 1 reported then exiting the lobby to the nurses\\' desk where another Staff ED RN, EI # 2 was working. \\n\\nEI # 2 reported to EI # 1, \"I guess they were going to leave,\" as EI # 2 observed the patient and another female via a computer monitor in the ED exit the ED lobby.  \\n\\nEI # 1 (Staff RN, ED, responsible for triage of PI # 1) confirmed EI # 2 did not hear the conversation in the lobby with PI # 1. EI # 2 only observed the patient and family exit the ED lobby to a private vehicle in the parking lot.\\n\\nEI # 1 reported the process when a patient comes to the ER.  The patient \"registers, then the ward clerk tells the RN the patient presented with chest pain or shortness of breath, one of us (RN\\'s) physically goes out to the lobby gets the patient, brings them to a bed and triage is completed in an exam room...\"  \\n\\nEI # 1 reported she had planned to put PI # 1 in a wheelchair after she retrieved the chair and transfer the patient to an exam room bed where PI # 1 would be triaged and bypass the traditional triage room.\\n\\nEI # 1 verbalized there was no interaction between the patient and family member and / or the nurse and family member during the initial lobby encounter. The family member, on the phone continued to scream, \"I\\'m just going to Enterprise.\"  EI # 1 reported PI # 1 was tearing and crying like she was hurting. \\n\\nEI # 1 reported she did not visualize any blood. EI # 1 denied patient reports of  problems other than cramping and vaginal bleeding which required 1 pad change every hour. \\n\\nEI # 1 acknowledged the potential for the patient\\'s water to break (membrane rupture).\\n\\nEI # 1 reported she documented in the medical record that PI # 1 left without being seen. \\n\\nEI # 1 notified EI # 4, ED Physician at Hospital # 1, who was present in the ED when PI # 1 arrived on 6/12/17.  According to the ED Staff RN, EI # 4 responded, \"We would be more than glad to see them.\" \\n\\nEI # 1 reported she had no knowledge who PI # 1\\'s physician was, only that the physician was in Enterprise.  EI # 1 verbalized if PI # 1 had come to the back (triage), if something was wrong, she would have called the clinic, looked up PI # 1\\'s medical history, got a release signed, faxed the paper work and could have reviewed PI # 1\\'s obstetrical history.   \\n\\nEI # 1 confirmed the triage and medical screening was not completed for PI # 1. There was no documentation an AMA (against medical advice) was obtained. There was no documentation of a conversation regarding completion of an AMA form with PI # 1 and the family member.\\n\\nEI # 1 reported a written statement of the events of 6/12/17 of PI # 1\\'s ER  visit was completed on 6/19/17 at the request of the Director Of Nurses, EI # 7.  EI # 1 confirmed the following  events were documented on the written statement:\\n\\nOn June 12, 2017 around 5 AM, this nurse went to check on a patient in the lobby that had registered to be seen. The patient told the ward clerk that she was 27 weeks pregnant, cramping  and bleeding. I (the nurse) went to check on the patient, and bring her back to be seen by our doctor. As I opened the door, her grandmother was on her cell phone screaming \" I\\'m just going to take her to Enterprise\".  I (the nurse) looked at the patient who was crying, and \"ask her who her OB GYN was?\" The patient stated \"he is in Enterprise.\"  This whole time the grandmother was still on her cell phone screaming \"I\\'m just going to take her to Enterprise,\" the grandmother never once took the cell phone down from her ear. I (the nurse) told the patient we would be glad to have her see our doctor, examine her, and we could listen to the babies heart beat.\"  I (the nurse) told the patient \"not to get up, that the nurse was going to get the other RN and a wheelchair.\" I (the nurse) went back to the ER, and as I (the nurse) approached the desk, the other RN (named staff) saw them get up and leave on the video camera. He stated to the nurse (myself) \"the patient had just walked out of the hospital.\"                  \\n\\n\\nInterview with EI # 4, ED Physician at Hospital # 1, on 6/27/17 at 14:10: \\n\\nThe physician confirmed he was present as the ER  attending physician when PI # 1 (MDS) dated [DATE].   EI # 4 stated the nurse notified him about PI # 1.  The physician said he would have been glad to examine PI # 1, but the patient left without being seen and he was unable to do a medical screening examination.  \\n\\n \\nInterview with Family Identifier (FI # 1) on 6/28/17 at 13:40:  \\n\\nFI # 1 reported the patient, PI # 1 drove herself to the ER  at Hospital # 1 and arrived at 04:30.  She (PI # 1) called me and I met her at the hospital.\" According to FI# 1, the patient, PI # 1, told the \"receptionist\" she was bleeding and cramping and had a previous delivery at 27 weeks.  PI # 1 was crying.  \\n\\nA nurse came out to the lobby and said there was nothing the hospital could do, but \"monitor FHT\\'s (Fetal Heart Tones).  We (Hospital # 1) don\\'t have OB.\" (Obstetrical services).  FI # 1 asked the nurse if she would monitor FHT\\'s?  According to FI # 1, the nurse replied, \"If I was ya\\'ll, I wouldn\\'t waste anymore time.\"  We (PI # 1 and FI # 1) decided to go to Hospital # 2.  \\n\\n\\nInterview with Patient Identifier (PI # 1) on 6/28/17 at 13:50:\\n\\nAccording to PI # 1, she arrived at Hospital # 1\\'s ER  on 6/12/17 at 04:30.  \"I told the receptionist  I was bleeding, cramping and had a previous pregnancy at 27 weeks.  I am a high risk pregnancy.  I need to get to the back and see somebody.\"  \\n\\n\"I was scared.  I was trying to get to the back (ED treatment area).\"  A nurse (EI # 1) came out to the lobby and said the only thing she could do was check Fetal Heart Tones.  She said there was no OB/GYN (Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician) at the hospital (Hospital # 1).  She said it was best for me to go to Enterprise.\" (name of city where Hospital # 2 is located).  PI # 1 described the ED nurses\\' attitude as \"nonchalant.\"  \\n\\n\\nIV.

History and Physical for Baby (PI # 33 ) at Hospital # 2: \\n\\nadmitted  : 6/12/17\\n\\nAdmission and Transfer Summary: \\n\\nChief Complaint: Extreme prematurity at 27 weeks.\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness: \"I was called to a C- Section this morning...for a 27 week estimated gestational age delivery.  Mom (PI # 1) had a previous C-Section (cecesarian section) - came in dilated with a bulging bag. Baby was delivered by C-Section breech presentation.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  Rupture of membranes at delivery.   The baby was limp and not breathing, had a heart rate of less than 100, but above 60.  PPV (Positive pressure ventilation: The provision of air under pressure by a mechanical respirator, a machine designed to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere, medicinenet.com) was initiated for three minutes in the C-section room with 100% oxygen.  APGARS (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) were one at one minute, 2 APGARS at 2 minutes and 7 APGARS at 5 minutes (APGAR: a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score reveals how well the baby is doing outside the mother\\'s womb, medlineplus.gov).\"\\n\\n\"Baby was brought to the nursery...and weighed 870 grams.  The initial oxygen saturation was 85% on room air.  Blow-by was initiated and oxygen saturations improved to 95 - 100%....(blow-by: an imprecise method of oxygen delivery in which an oxygen source discharges oxygen in front of the nostrils or mouth of the patient. Used primarily to supply supplemental oxygen to  neonates, who may not tolerate wearing other oxygen delivery systems, Medical Dictionary, © 2009 Farlex and Partners).\"  \\n\\n\"Due to the baby\\'s prematurity we elected to intubate the baby...Oxygen saturations rose to 100%...The baby was then placed on the ventilator at the pressure of 20/4 with a rate of 40 on 30% (oxygen).  Oxygen saturations had been 95% to 100%.  (ventilator: a machine designed to move breathable air into and out of the lungs, to provide breathing for a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently,wikipedia.org).\" \\n\\n\"Blood sugar ...was 50 (normal level when babies are 1 hour to 2 hours old is just under 2 mmol/L millimoles per liter; the presence of high levels of glucose (sugar) in blood occurs due to the lack of sufficient levels of insulin in the body, dovemed.com).\"\\n\\n\"...Heart rates in the 150\\'s. Respiratory rates in the 40\\'s to 60\\'s.  We will obtain a CBC (Complete Blood Count) and a blood culture.

We decreased the rate to 30. (ABG\\'s measure the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well the lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood, webmd.com).\"\\n\\n\"Chest x-ray showed mild interstitial lung disease, but the Endotracheal Tube placement was good.
