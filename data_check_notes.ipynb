The ones that were coded as pertaining to pregnant patients are in [data/manual/confirmed_pregnant.xlsx](data/manual/confirmed_pregnant.xlsx), and the ones that were not are in [data/manual/not_confirmed_pregnant.xlsx](data/manual/not_confirmed_pregnant.xlsx) -- mostly generated from the following. Not sure where to put this code yet, should maybe leave it unpublished and only publish the resultant data sets."
