## Scripps News Pregnant in the ER Methodological Notes

Scripps News based this investigation on data Rachel Gold, Scripps News data reporter, publicly obtained through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospitals website. The data is a list of deficiencies in which hospitals have violated CMS Conditions of Participation (CoP), including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).

Enforcing EMTALA is primarily a complaint-driven system, leaving the burden of reporting violations in the hands of patients and hospital staff.Â 

The data contains rows of violations from January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2022 from short-term, critical access and psychiatric hospitals in all 50 states. Each violation has a unique identifier, EVENT_ID, that groups together violations within the same investigation. One investigation (EVENT_ID) may have multiple violations. The dataset labels each violation with a deficiency tag that correlates to the specific CMS Condition of Participation violated within the investigation.

Scripps News reporters limited their analysis to short-term and critical access hospitals (as opposed to psychiatric hospitals) because reporters agreed pregnant patients experiencing medical emergencies were most likely to go to short-term and critical access hospitals for care.

Scripps News reporters' main goal was to capture any EMTALA violations that involved a pregnant patient. EMTALA violations are cataloged by deficiency tags 2400 through 2411. Reporters filtered the dataset for all violations with EMTALA deficiency tags.

Each violation includes an inspection text, a detailed note of the violation. This text tells the story of the patient including a patient identifier, the medical complaint, a timeline of events, interviews with medical professionals and any policies relating to the violation. Any identifying patient or medical professional information was heavily redacted.

##Capturing EMTALA Violations Involving Pregnant Patients

Scripps News reporters realized capturing violations involving a pregnant patient would require three separate keyword searches. The reasons were two-fold:

The inspection text included hospital policies regarding pregnant patients but the patient within the violation was not pregnant. Reporters did not want to capture these violations.

Inspection texts identified a pregnant patient using a variety of descriptors relating to pregnancy or obstetrics.

#Keyword Search

Scripps News reporters found the following key words were more likely to improperly capture violations describing hospital policies for pregnant patients but the patient within the violation was not pregnant. Reporters replaced these key words with blank spaces within the inspection text:

#Hospitals Turning Away Pregnant Patients

Scripps News Reporters manually reviewed every captured EMTALA violation of inappropriate transfer, lack of medical screening exam and lack of stabilization within our EMTALA pregnancy database. These violations are the most serious because they pose the greatest health risk if violated and can be potentially life-threatening. Scripps News determined whether a pregnant patient was turned away from the emergency department if the patient sought care and was not able to receive it. Reporters found at least 241 investigations of women being turned away.
