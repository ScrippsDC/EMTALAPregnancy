SOUTHWEST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,Critical Access Hospitals,061327,1311 N MILDRED RD,CORTEZ,CO,2402,POSTING OF SIGNS,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,C4HB11,"

Based on observation and interviews the facility failed to ensure Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) signage was posted at relevant locations in the facility.

Findings include:

Facility policy: 

The EMTALA (Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act) policy read, the hospital must post conspicuously, in the dedicated emergency departments and all areas in which individuals routinely present for treatment of emergency medical conditions and wait prior to examination and treatment, (such as entrance, admitting areas, waiting room or treatment room) signs that specify the rights of an individual under the law with respect to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women who are pregnant and are having contractions. 

1. The facility failed to post signs, specifying the rights of individuals seeking examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor, at entrances and waiting areas used by patients seeking emergency services and by pregnant women. Specifically, there was no EMTALA signage at the main entrance to the hospital, the emergency department (ED) ambulance bay, or in the ED waiting area outside patient registration. 

a. On 10/23/18 at 8:50 a.m., a tour of the facility was conducted with the executive assistant (Assistant #1). Observations of the main entrance of the hospital showed a temporary sign posted outside of the building, which indicated an emergency room    entrance. There was no EMTALA signage posted within the entrance door and hallway.  

A continued facility tour of the ED waiting room showed no evidence of signage which described patients' rights under EMTALA. The only sign noted was posted in the hallway past the ED registration desk. The sign could not be visualized from the ED patient waiting area. This was in contrast to policy which stated the hospital must post rights of an individual under the EMTALA law, in a conspicuous area; including entrance, admitting areas, waiting room or treatment room. 

b. A tour of the ED's ambulance bay, including the door and surrounding areas, showed no evidence of any signage describing patients' rights under EMTALA. At 9:32 a.m., Assistant #1 confirmed the ambulance bay was recently painted and there were no signs present. 

c. On 10/23/18 at 10:07 a.m., a tour of the family birthing center was conducted, there was no signage posted which described patients' rights under EMTALA. According to Assistant #1, the back way to the birthing center from the ED was blocked off at the end of the hall. She said the current path from the ED registration desk to the birthing center was through the main hospital lobby. 

Obstetric (OB) registered nurse (RN #2) and RN #3 were interviewed. Both worked in the family birthing center. RN #3 stated most patients would bypass the ED registration and come straight to the unit. She stated the door directly to the ED was blocked for construction. RN #2 stated any patient who was more than 20 weeks pregnant would come directly to the family birthing center from the main hospital entrance.  She then confirmed the patients were not being transported through the hall past registration (where the EMTALA sign was noted), since 10/3/18.

Based on record review, document review, staff interview, physician interview and policy review, the hospital failed to comply with special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases.  The hospital failed to:
1. Perform a medical screening and failed to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to an individual with an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) in one (1) of one (1) known cases, Patient #1, and on five (5) of five (5) days documented that the hospital emergency room    (ER) was closed and on diversion; and 
2. Have policies and procedures regarding EMTALA violations and whistleblowers.
Findings include:
Hospital #2 ' s Risk Manager reported to the State Agency, that on 04-08-13, eight (8) month old Patient #1 was found unresponsive by his parents and taken by private vehicle to Hospital #1. It is alleged the family of this patient was told at Hospital #1 that the emergency room    (ER) was closed and they were flagged on to Hospital #2. In route their car broke down and they called 911. When the patient was brought into Hospital #2 via ambulance, he was pronounced dead on arrival. Hospital #2 ' s Risk Manager was reporting this to the State Agency as an EMTALA.
On 04-12-2013 at 10:30 a.m., an interview with the mother of Patient #1, revealed that when they pulled up to Hospital #1, her husband ran up to the doors and started beating on the doors yelling,  "" My baby needs help! ""   "" I stayed in the car doing CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) on my baby and a man came to the door and told us the emergency room    was closed and we needed to go to one of the nearby hospitals. ""  
On 04-15-2013 at 6:03 p.m., a phone call was placed to Hospital #1. A Registered Nurse (RN) answered the phone stating,  "" emergency room   . ""  When asked if the ER  was open the RN stated,  "" Yes. ""   At 10:17 p.m., another call was placed to the same phone number at Hospital #1. A Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) answered and stated,  "" emergency room   . ""   She identified herself as an LPN and stated that the ER  was open.
On 04-16-2013 at 9:01 a.m., an unannounced visit was made to Hospital #1. When the hospital Administrator and/or the Director of Nursing (DON) were asked for, the receptionist stated that the hospital was without an administrator and the DON was an interim and she was not there. The receptionist called the Administrative Assistant (Employee #5) and told her a State Surveyor was there. A short entrance conference was held with Employee #5, who stated that she knew of the incident that had occurred on 04-08-2013 when they did not have a doctor. When asked,  "" How does the hospital with a dedicated emergency room    close? ""  she stated,  "" We divert. ""   The policy for diversion was requested. 
On 04-16-13 at 9:15 a.m., a tour of the ER  revealed signage for EMTALA was posted in the waiting room and the triage room. The ER  was staffed by a RN (Employee #1), who was covering the entire hospital that day, and the ER  Physician for the 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift (Employee #2/Assistant Chief of Staff).
In an interview at 9:30 a.m. on 04-16-13, Employee #1 stated that he arrived for his 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift on Monday, 04-08-13, and was told that a baby had been brought to the ER  in the early hours of 04-08 and the family was told the hospital had no ER  physician.  He stated that the county coroner had come to the hospital at 6:00 a.m. and told them the baby was dead on arrival to another hospital.  He further stated,  "" I had already heard about it because I work at (Hospital #2) too and they had called to give me a heads up. When I arrived for my 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift here , there was no physician.  A ward clerk was the only one in the ER  that night and there was an RN on the floor. ""  When asked,  "" What does your ER  do when there is no physician? ""  Employee #1 stated,  "" We divert. We fill out a form every 12 hours and there is a list of people we also notify. ""   When asked,  "" How does the public know? ""  he stated,  "" A sign is posted on the outside of the door. ""  During this interview the hospital ' s Diversion Book was reviewed. This review revealed that the diversion dates documented in the book were:  03-10-2013, 03-11-2013, 03-12-2013, 04-07-13 and 04-08-13. There was only one (1) diversion sheet filled out. The diversion sheet stated that two (2) ambulance services must be called and a diversion sheet must be done every 12 hours that the hospital is on diversion.  Employee #1 stated,  "" There was a policy in the front of the book, but it is gone. ""   A copy of the Diversion Policy was requested from Employee #5 at that time.  Employee #1 stated,  "" There has been only one RN per shift for some time and at night there is not always an RN. ""   Review of the hospital ' s staffing schedule confirmed his statement. (This hospital has a med-surg unit, a geri-psych unit and an ER.) Employee #1 also stated,  "" The emergency room    used to have telemedicine but the last administrator got rid of it. We are getting it back. And we are getting a new administrator. ""
On 04-16-13 at 10:30 a.m.,  an interview with Employee #2 revealed,  "" The ER  is hard to staff because it is so rural and the pay is low because of low census. The board is in discussion right now regarding salaries. ""   When asked about diversion, Employee #2 stated,  "" The Interim Director of Nursing told us that if there is no physician, then put the sign on the outside of the emergency room    door stating the emergency room    is closed and lock the doors. Then the hospital goes on diversion... Neither the Chief of Staff or the Assistant Chief of Staff are notified when there is no ER  physician...The Chief of Staff only lives two (2) blocks away.
There is no on-call policy for the days or nights there is not a physician in house... Telecommunication is supposed to be returned to the emergency room   ... The diversion policy and other problems were reviewed at the last trustees meeting about three (3) weeks ago. ""   Employee #2 was asked for the policy for diversion and a policy for what the emergency room    does if there is no physician. Review of the hospital ' s Emergency Policies submitted by Employee #2 revealed that they had been last updated in 2008.  There was no documented evidence of EMTALA policies, a whistleblower policy, or of a diversion policy.
In an interview on 04-16-13, Employee #5 was notified that the minutes from the last trustees meeting were needed.  They were submitted for review at 1:15 p.m. on 04-16-13. When updated policies were requested for the emergency room   , Employee #5 stated she would go into the Administrator and the DON ' s offices and see if they could be located.  On 04-17-13 Employee #5 stated that she could not find any EMTALA policies and no updated ER  policies.
On 04-17-13 at 10:50 a.m., an interview with the Ward Clerk (Employee #3), revealed,  "" I was working the night of April 08, 2013.  I was restocking the ER  and I looked outside as a white SUV flies up in the parking lot, a man jumps out and runs up the walk way.  I walked outside and asked could I help him. He said,  ' My child is having trouble breathing. '  I said,  ' We are on diversion. We do not have a doctor. '  Before I could tell him the nearest hospital he could go to, he jumped back in his car and drove away. I then reported it to my charge nurse. The coroner came by about 6:00 a.m. and told us what had happened to the baby and that it was pronounced dead on arrival at (Hospital #2). ""  When asked how long the ER  had been having problems with staffing of physicians the Ward Clerk stated,  "" Since early March. ""   The Ward Clerk ' s statement was read back to him and he signed it. 
04-18-13 at 10:00 a.m., a meeting was held with the complainant, the Risk Manager at Hospital #2. She stated,  "" As soon as I heard about this, I began to investigate the situation.  When I realized it was a possible EMTALA violation, I notified you (State Agency).  I also called the other hospital (Hospital #1), so they would know I was reporting it. ""
Review of the ER  record submitted for Patient #1 by Hospital #2 revealed that the baby was 8 months old and weighed 9 pounds.  He was born two (2) months early and had one (1) kidney, spinal bifida, mitral valve replacement, and an open cleft palette. The baby was brought into the ER  by ambulance, because the parent ' s car broke down on the way, and was pronounced dead on arrival.
On 04-19-13 at 9:00 a.m., both ambulance agencies used by Hospital #1, Ambulance Service #1 and Ambulance Service #2, were contacted by phone. Both agencies took down the dates that the hospital diverted and stated they would investigate whether they were notified by the hospital of their diversion on those dates and would call back.  Neither ambulance agency called back.
On 04-19-13 at 10:15 a.m., an exit conference was held with Hospital #1 officials. Officials stated that in a meeting held that morning, the trustees had named an Interim Director of Nursing. There were still no policies for the emergency room   , but they were working on that and that telecommunications was going to be put back in, but no date was given. No further information was provided.  
On 04-23-13 at 1:45 p.m., Ambulance Service #1 was called via phone and an employee was told of the information needed. She stated that she would call back in fifteen minutes. No call back was received. An attempt to call Ambulance Service #1 again went unanswered. 
On 04-23-13 at 2:00 p.m., Ambulance Service #2 was called via phone and a supervisor was requested.  After speaking with a supervisor and explaining the information needed, she stated,  "" I do not know if historically we keep that information. ""   She stated that she would need an hour and she would call back, but that it might be their compliance officer returning the call. No call back was received.

PROVIDENCE ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL,Short Term,050069,1100 WEST STEWART DR,ORANGE,CA,2402,POSTING OF SIGNS,2011-11-10T00:00:00Z,WEKB11,"


Based on observation and interview, the hospital failed to conspicuously post signage in the ED waiting rooms and treatment rooms and in the L&D (Labor and Delivery) waiting room and registration area. This could result in patients being unaware of their rights for examination in the event of an emergency medical condition. 

Findings:

1. On 11/9/11, at 1330 hours, the hospital's ED was toured with the ED Director. The Director stated the ED had three waiting rooms. The initial waiting room, Waiting Room One was the initial entry point for all non-ambulance patients arriving at the ED. Immediately to the left of Waiting Room One a screening nurse was stationed. To the right, a security officer was stationed. Past the screening nurse, also on the left, were the patient registration area and the entrance to triage. To the right there were seats for patients and visitors. No signage specifying the rights of individuals for examination and treatment with respect to emergency medical conditions and women in labor in the ED was visible in Waiting Area One.

On the wall of the hallway leading to Waiting Rooms Two and Three the required emergency treatment signage was observed. The print font of the sign, according to the Director, was sufficient in size. However, it was difficult to read if a person was more than one foot away.  

At 1345 hours, an interview was conducted with the parents of Patient 9, an ED pediatric patient waiting to be seen. When questioned about signs they had seen stating their child's rights to receive emergency treatment, both parents stated they had not noticed the signs.

During a tour of the treatment areas of the ED no conspicuous posting of signage was observed in locations likely to be noted by patients, informing them of their right to a medical screening examination, regardless of the ability to pay and whether the hospital participated in the Medicaid program.


 


2. The L&D area was toured with the L&D Nurse Manager and the Director of Regulatory on 11/9/11 at 1340 hours. The Nurse Manager stated if a patient who was more than 20 weeks pregnant presented to the ED with problems related to the pregnancy the patient would be brought to the L&D unit for examination and observation. 

Observation of the small waiting area outside of the patient registration room as well as the inside of the patient registration room did not show signage specifying the rights of individuals for examination and treatment with respect to emergency medical conditions and women in labor and notice the hospital participated in the Medicaid program.  

The required signage was found located inside of a room the Nurse Manager stated was used to triage the pregnant patients waiting for an examination.

At 1345 hours, an interview was conducted with the parents of Patient 9, an ED pediatric patient waiting to be seen. When questioned about signs they had seen stating their child's rights to receive emergency treatment, both parents stated they had not noticed the signs.

During a tour of the treatment areas of the ED no conspicuous posting of signage was observed in locations likely to be noted by patients, informing them of their right to a medical screening examination, regardless of the ability to pay and whether the hospital participated in the Medicaid program.


 


2. The L&D area was toured with the L&D Nurse Manager and the Director of Regulatory on 11/9/11 at 1340 hours. The Nurse Manager stated if a patient who was more than 20 weeks pregnant presented to the ED with problems related to the pregnancy the patient would be brought to the L&D unit for examination and observation. 

Observation of the small waiting area outside of the patient registration room as well as the inside of the patient registration room did not show signage specifying the rights of individuals for examination and treatment with respect to emergency medical conditions and women in labor and notice the hospital participated in the Medicaid program.  

The required signage was found located inside of a room the Nurse Manager stated was used to triage the pregnant patients waiting for an examination.

Based on observations, interviews and record reviews, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one patient (#1) in the selected sample of 21 received an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department (ED).  The facility failed to follow their policies ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" and ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" resulting in Patient #1 not receiving an appropriate medical screening to determine if an emergency medical condition existed.  Findings include:

 Review of the facility policy ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" revealed ""Every person presenting to the Emergency Department shall receive an appropriate medical screening examination.  This examination must be sufficient to determine if the person has an emergency medical condition.""  Review of the facility policy ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" revealed ""the initial medical screening examination must be conducted by qualified medical personnel to determine with reasonable confidence whether an emergency medical condition exists.  The medical screening examination should be an ongoing process accompanied by a record that reflects continuous monitoring of the patient.  An emergency medical condition is a condition whose acute symptoms are severe enough that without immediate medical attention, it is expected to jeopardize the health of the individual, seriously impair bodily function, or cause serious dysfunction of any organ or body part.  Symptoms include pain, psychiatric disturbances, and substance abuse."" 

A review of the medical staff rules and regulations revealed the ""EMTALA  related medical screening examination"" could be performed by the following:  The ED Physicians, the ED Physician's Assistants, and the ED Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners.  Additionally, the obstetric nurses were authorized to perform the medical screening examination for pregnant patients at 20 weeks or greater gestation. 

A video of Patient #1 taken on 03/19/11 in the Emergency Department (ED) was provided by the facility for surveyor review.  Review of the video revealed it did not contain audio nor was there the ability to know what  time events took place.  There was a minute and second counter on the video.  The video encompassed the entire time Patient #1 was in the ED.  Observations of the video revealed the following:  Patient #1 entered the behavioral health room in the ED and sat down on the end of the stretcher.  Patient #1's hands were cuffed and his/her legs were shackled. Outside of the room was a Deputy Jailor and a facility Security Officer.  ED staff entered the room and obtained vital signs.  Patient #1 could be observed with his/her mouth moving.  ED nursing staff performed a nursing assessment.  An ED Nurse Technician was present in the room with Patient #1 when Patient #1 came to a standing position and lunged toward the female staff.  A facility Security Officer intervened.  Patient #1's mouth was continually moving.  Patient #1's assigned ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was observed for 36 seconds in the hall area outside of Patient #1's ED room.  During the 36 seconds ED Physician #2 was talking with the Deputy Jailor in the hallway (not looking in the room where Patient #1 was located), then moved into the doorway where Patient #1 could be viewed for 4 seconds, and then he left the area.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  Three ED nursing staff and a Security Officer entered Patient #1's room.  Patient #1 stood up, leaned over the stretcher, and permitted the staff to administer two injections of medications in the buttocks area.  Another ED physician (Physician #1), who was not treating or involved in Patient #1's care, entered Patient #1's room, 1.5 minutes after the medications were administered.  ED Physician #1 was observed rushing into the room and making statements to Patient #1, while raising his arm and pointing his finger at Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 started to leave the room when Patient #1 said something.  Physician #1 abruptly turned around and went back toward Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 placed his left hand on Patient #1's neck and upper chest area and pushed Patient #1 down on the stretcher.  ED Physician #1 left Patient #1's ED room and did not return while Patient #1 was in the ED.  Later after Patient #1 calmed down and was lying quietly on the stretcher, ED Physician #2 (attending physician) came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room and looked into the room for 5 to 6 seconds and walked off.  There was no conversation between Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  ED Physician #2 did not come to the doorway or enter Patient #1's room at any other time while Patient #1 was in the ED.  A meal tray was served to Patient #1.  Patient #1 was calm and consumed his/her meal tray without any further incidents.  Patient #1 was observed calmly walking out of the ED accompanied by the Deputy Jailor.     

A review of the history of Patient #1's visits to the facility's ED and admissions to the facility revealed Patient #1 had been admitted     to the facility's psychiatric unit on 03/23/09 through 04/01/09 with the diagnosis of ""Psychosis.""  Patient #1 had been experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices).

A review of Patient #1's ED medical record for 03/19/11 revealed he/she presented to the ED at 1437 accompanied by the police (from jail).  The police had a ""Uniform Citation"" that was presented to the facility which charged Patient #1 with ""Arrest, person is mentally ill and a danger to self and others.""  Patient #1 was brought to the facility ED by order of the County Attorney.  Review of the ""Focused Nursing Assessment"" revealed Patient #1 was agitated and cursing loudly.  His/Her face was red from pepper spray.  Patient #1 stated his/her skin was burning from the pepper spray.  Review of Physician #2's documentation revealed Patient #1 was ""very angry, combative, cursing, and yelling.""  Additionally,  ED Physician #2 documented that Patient #1 was  uncooperative for an exam, hostile, unable to determine orientation, normal motor and sensory response, normal inspection of neck and back, no respiratory distress, normal skin color, no rash, no signs of injury to the extremities.  ED Physician #2 documented Patient #1 was on a 72 hour emergency hold due to danger to self and potentially violent.  Patient #1's past history was ""bipolar disorder.""  The clinical impression was ""agitation"" and the physician documented that he counseled Patient #1 on the diagnosis and need for follow-up.  Review of the Medication Administration Record revealed that on 03/19/11 at 1450 Patient #1 received Geodon 20 mg intramuscular (IM) and Ativan 2 mg IM.  A fingerstick blood sugar was performed but no laboratory work or x-rays were ordered.  Patient #1 was discharged    from the ED on 03/19/11 at 1547 to police custody.  ED nursing staff documented Patient #1 was ""more calm"" at the time of discharge.  There was no documentation in the medical record by ED Physician #1.

An interview with ED Physician #1 on 03/29/11 at 2:15 PM, revealed he did not perform a medical screening on Patient #1 on 03/19/11; he was only intervening with Patient #1's disruptive behavior.

A tour of the ED on 03/29/11 at 3:30 PM revealed there was a patient in the behavior health ED room.  When standing in the hallway the patient could not be observed inside of the behavioral health ED room.  Located at the nurse's station was the monitor screen for the behavioral health room.  The picture was black and white. There was no ability to view any specifics about a patient such as skin color or the condition of the skin or the body.  

An interview with ED Physician #2 on 03/29/11 at 3:35 PM, revealed the medical screening was ""primarily a mental evaluation.""  He stated he did not review any of Patient #1's previous ED and/or hospital admissions.  He stated initially there was no conversation with Patient #1 because it was ""obviously pointless.""  He stated he could not ask Patient #1 any questions or do a formal evaluation.  After the medication was administered and Patient #1 began calming down, he stated he looked in on Patient #1 but did not examine the patient.  ED Physician #2 stated he felt Patient #1 was oriented and coherent.  He stated that usually the ED Physician would screen a patient and then they would call behavioral health if the patient might need to be admitted    .  He felt Patient #1 was ""clearly not suicidal.""  He stated he did not call Behavioral Health to assess because he felt that Patient #1 knew what he/she was saying.  Additionally, if Patient #1 had not been in custody, he felt it might have been different because Patient #1 could not do anything in jail.  ED Physician #2 stated he could hear Patient #1 from the hallway and other areas of the ED.  

An interview with the Deputy Jailor on 03/30/11 at 11:45 AM, revealed Patient #1 was brought to the ED on 03/19/11 because he/she had been throwing food in the jail, washing his/her hair with toilet water, not sleeping, acting bizarre, talking out of his/her head making statements about being pregnant with twins, and talking about the devil.  Jail personnel had been instructed by the County Attorney to take Patient #1 to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.  On the ride to the hospital, Patient #1 was saying he/she was pregnant with twins and screaming and then would get quiet.  The Deputy Jailor stated he did not observe the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) go into the room and examine or talk to Patient #1 anytime during the ED visit.  After returning to the jail Patient #1 slept through the night.  The next day Patient #1's behavior began escalating again.  After the effects of the medication, that was administered in the ED, wore off Patient #1 began screaming out and talking about being pregnant.  Patient #1 required tazing on 03/20/11 due to his/her behavior.  On 03/21/11 Patient #1 was evaluated by a Mental Health Professional and Patient #1 was sent to a psychiatric hospital for admission.

An interview with the President of the contracted group of ED Physicians on 03/30/11 at 3:00 PM, revealed his typical emergency medical screening on a patient presenting with problems such as Patient #1, would include obtaining lab work, request Behavioral Health to evaluate, and then make a decision on the disposition of the patient.

An interview was conducted on 03/31/11 at 1:30 PM, with the Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, who was on-call on 03/19/11.  She revealed she was not called to assess Patient #1 in the ED on 03/19/11. 

An interview with the Chief of Staff of the ED on 03/31/11 at 2:05 PM, revealed every physician had a different routine of performing a medical screening of a patient with agitated behavior.  He stated he would get information from the police and try to interview the patient.  He usually obtained lab work to medically clear the patient and then got a psychiatric evaluation from Behavioral Health. 

A review of the ""History (Psychiatric-Medical Evaluation)"" from the admitting psychiatric facility revealed  Patient #1 was admitted     as an inpatient on 03/21/11.  The evaluation revealed Patient #1 was ""exhibiting volatile behavior"" and alternating between laughing inappropriately and crying.  Patient #1 believed he/she was pregnant with twins and the father was a celebrity.  Patient #1 was threatening and head banging causing severe bruising and black eyes.  He/She was very agitated, psychotic, and manic.  The patient had a history of ""Bipolar 1 Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features, and Personality Disorder NOS.""  The admitting diagnostic impression was ""Bipolar 1 disorder, most recent episode manic, severe with psychotic features, unspecified if mood-congruent psychotic features (principal).""

The facility failed to ensure an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted to determine if an emergency medical condition existed for Patient #1. Observations of the video the facility provided, record reviews and interviews revealed the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was at Patient #1's ED doorway on two occasions for a total of 9 to 10 seconds.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor an examination.  After Patient #1 had calmed down and was cooperative, ED Physician #2 still did not conduct a conversation or an examination of Patient #1 to determine the patient's mental status.  The failure to conduct an adequate medical screening resulted in Patient #1 being returned to the jail and he/she required tazing after the effects of the medication wore off.  Additionally, Patient #1 was admitted     to a psychiatric facility on 03/21/11 in a psychotic state and had sustained severe bruising and black eyes from head banging.  It was determined the facility's failure placed Patient #1 in imminent danger and at substantial risk of  death or serious physical harm.

An ED Nurse Technician was present in the room with Patient #1 when Patient #1 came to a standing position and lunged toward the female staff.  A facility Security Officer intervened.  Patient #1's mouth was continually moving.  Patient #1's assigned ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was observed for 36 seconds in the hall area outside of Patient #1's ED room.  During the 36 seconds ED Physician #2 was talking with the Deputy Jailor in the hallway (not looking in the room where Patient #1 was located), then moved into the doorway where Patient #1 could be viewed for 4 seconds, and then he left the area.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  Three ED nursing staff and a Security Officer entered Patient #1's room.  Patient #1 stood up, leaned over the stretcher, and permitted the staff to administer two injections of medications in the buttocks area.  Another ED physician (Physician #1), who was not treating or involved in Patient #1's care, entered Patient #1's room, 1.5 minutes after the medications were administered.  ED Physician #1 was observed rushing into the room and making statements to Patient #1, while raising his arm and pointing his finger at Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 started to leave the room when Patient #1 said something.  Physician #1 abruptly turned around and went back toward Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 placed his left hand on Patient #1's neck and upper chest area and pushed Patient #1 down on the stretcher.  ED Physician #1 left Patient #1's ED room and did not return while Patient #1 was in the ED.  Later after Patient #1 calmed down and was lying quietly on the stretcher, ED Physician #2 (attending physician) came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room and looked into the room for 5 to 6 seconds and walked off.  There was no conversation between Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  ED Physician #2 did not come to the doorway or enter Patient #1's room at any other time while Patient #1 was in the ED.  A meal tray was served to Patient #1.  Patient #1 was calm and consumed his/her meal tray without any further incidents.  Patient #1 was observed calmly walking out of the ED accompanied by the Deputy Jailor.     

A review of the history of Patient #1's visits to the facility's ED and admissions to the facility revealed Patient #1 had been admitted     to the facility's psychiatric unit on 03/23/09 through 04/01/09 with the diagnosis of ""Psychosis.""  Patient #1 had been experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices).

A review of Patient #1's ED medical record for 03/19/11 revealed he/she presented to the ED at 1437 accompanied by the police (from jail).  The police had a ""Uniform Citation"" that was presented to the facility which charged Patient #1 with ""Arrest, person is mentally ill and a danger to self and others.""  Patient #1 was brought to the facility ED by order of the County Attorney.  Review of the ""Focused Nursing Assessment"" revealed Patient #1 was agitated and cursing loudly.  His/Her face was red from pepper spray.  Patient #1 stated his/her skin was burning from the pepper spray.  Review of Physician #2's documentation revealed Patient #1 was ""very angry, combative, cursing, and yelling.""  Additionally,  ED Physician #2 documented that Patient #1 was  uncooperative for an exam, hostile, unable to determine orientation, normal motor and sensory response, normal inspection of neck and back, no respiratory distress, normal skin color, no rash, no signs of injury to the extremities.  ED Physician #2 documented Patient #1 was on a 72 hour emergency hold due to danger to self and potentially violent.  Patient #1's past history was ""bipolar disorder.""  The clinical impression was ""agitation"" and the physician documented that he counseled Patient #1 on the diagnosis and need for follow-up.  Review of the Medication Administration Record revealed that on 03/19/11 at 1450 Patient #1 received Geodon 20 mg intramuscular (IM) and Ativan 2 mg IM.  A fingerstick blood sugar was performed but no laboratory work or x-rays were ordered.  Patient #1 was discharged    from the ED on 03/19/11 at 1547 to police custody.  ED nursing staff documented Patient #1 was ""more calm"" at the time of discharge.  There was no documentation in the medical record by ED Physician #1.

An interview with ED Physician #1 on 03/29/11 at 2:15 PM, revealed he did not perform a medical screening on Patient #1 on 03/19/11; he was only intervening with Patient #1's disruptive behavior.

A tour of the ED on 03/29/11 at 3:30 PM revealed there was a patient in the behavior health ED room.  When standing in the hallway the patient could not be observed inside of the behavioral health ED room.  Located at the nurse's station was the monitor screen for the behavioral health room.  The picture was black and white. There was no ability to view any specifics about a patient such as skin color or the condition of the skin or the body.  

An interview with ED Physician #2 on 03/29/11 at 3:35 PM, revealed the medical screening was ""primarily a mental evaluation.""  He stated he did not review any of Patient #1's previous ED and/or hospital admissions.  He stated initially there was no conversation with Patient #1 because it was ""obviously pointless.""  He stated he could not ask Patient #1 any questions or do a formal evaluation.  After the medication was administered and Patient #1 began calming down, he stated he looked in on Patient #1 but did not examine the patient.  ED Physician #2 stated he felt Patient #1 was oriented and coherent.  He stated that usually the ED Physician would screen a patient and then they would call behavioral health if the patient might need to be admitted    .  He felt Patient #1 was ""clearly not suicidal.""  He stated he did not call Behavioral Health to assess because he felt that Patient #1 knew what he/she was saying.  Additionally, if Patient #1 had not been in custody, he felt it might have been different because Patient #1 could not do anything in jail.  ED Physician #2 stated he could hear Patient #1 from the hallway and other areas of the ED.  

An interview with the Deputy Jailor on 03/30/11 at 11:45 AM, revealed Patient #1 was brought to the ED on 03/19/11 because he/she had been throwing food in the jail, washing his/her hair with toilet water, not sleeping, acting bizarre, talking out of his/her head making statements about being pregnant with twins, and talking about the devil.  Jail personnel had been instructed by the County Attorney to take Patient #1 to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.  On the ride to the hospital, Patient #1 was saying he/she was pregnant with twins and screaming and then would get quiet.  The Deputy Jailor stated he did not observe the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) go into the room and examine or talk to Patient #1 anytime during the ED visit.  After returning to the jail Patient #1 slept through the night.  The next day Patient #1's behavior began escalating again.  After the effects of the medication, that was administered in the ED, wore off Patient #1 began screaming out and talking about being pregnant.  Patient #1 required tazing on 03/20/11 due to his/her behavior.  On 03/21/11 Patient #1 was evaluated by a Mental Health Professional and Patient #1 was sent to a psychiatric hospital for admission.

An interview with the President of the contracted group of ED Physicians on 03/30/11 at 3:00 PM, revealed his typical emergency medical screening on a patient presenting with problems such as Patient #1, would include obtaining lab work, request Behavioral Health to evaluate, and then make a decision on the disposition of the patient.

An interview was conducted on 03/31/11 at 1:30 PM, with the Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, who was on-call on 03/19/11.  She revealed she was not called to assess Patient #1 in the ED on 03/19/11. 

An interview with the Chief of Staff of the ED on 03/31/11 at 2:05 PM, revealed every physician had a different routine of performing a medical screening of a patient with agitated behavior.  He stated he would get information from the police and try to interview the patient.  He usually obtained lab work to medically clear the patient and then got a psychiatric evaluation from Behavioral Health. 

A review of the ""History (Psychiatric-Medical Evaluation)"" from the admitting psychiatric facility revealed  Patient #1 was admitted     as an inpatient on 03/21/11.  The evaluation revealed Patient #1 was ""exhibiting volatile behavior"" and alternating between laughing inappropriately and crying.  Patient #1 believed he/she was pregnant with twins and the father was a celebrity.  Patient #1 was threatening and head banging causing severe bruising and black eyes.  He/She was very agitated, psychotic, and manic.  The patient had a history of ""Bipolar 1 Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features, and Personality Disorder NOS.""  The admitting diagnostic impression was ""Bipolar 1 disorder, most recent episode manic, severe with psychotic features, unspecified if mood-congruent psychotic features (principal).""

The facility failed to ensure an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted to determine if an emergency medical condition existed for Patient #1. Observations of the video the facility provided, record reviews and interviews revealed the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was at Patient #1's ED doorway on two occasions for a total of 9 to 10 seconds.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor an examination.  After Patient #1 had calmed down and was cooperative, ED Physician #2 still did not conduct a conversation or an examination of Patient #1 to determine the patient's mental status.  The failure to conduct an adequate medical screening resulted in Patient #1 being returned to the jail and he/she required tazing after the effects of the medication wore off.  Additionally, Patient #1 was admitted     to a psychiatric facility on 03/21/11 in a psychotic state and had sustained severe bruising and black eyes from head banging.  It was determined the facility's failure placed Patient #1 in imminent danger and at substantial risk of  death or serious physical harm.

Based on observations, interviews and record reviews, it was determined the facility failed to ensure that a patient presenting with an emergency medical condition, received an appropriate examination and treatment, that was within the capabilities of the facility, to stabilize a psychiatric condition for one patient (#1) in the selected sample of 21.

Findings include:

A video of Patient #1 taken on 03/19/11 in the Emergency Department (ED) was provided by the facility for surveyor review.  The video encompassed the entire time Patient #1 was in the ED.  Observations of the video revealed the following:  Patient #1 entered the behavioral health room in the ED and sat down on the end of the stretcher.  Patient #1's hands were cuffed and his/her legs were shackled.  ED staff entered the room and obtained vital signs.  Patient #1 could be observed with his/her mouth moving.

Based on interview, record review, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24 Special Responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases for two (2) of twenty-one (21) patients that presented to the facility extension Emergency Department (ED), Patients #1 and #20.  The facility extension failed to ensure a medical screening examination (MSE) was provided for Patient #1 on 01/12/13 after he/she was brought to their ambulance bay for treatment of a possible emergency medical condition. The facility extension failed to ensure an appropriate transfer was accomplished on 07/30/12 for Patient #20 when he/she was transferred to an external psychiatric facility. 

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who will investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.  Additionally, the policy revealed patients transferred to an external psychiatric facility must have a transfer form completed by the Physician, Social Worker (if applicable), and Nurse.  The policy further revealed the patient must be medically and psychiatrically stable before being transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  It stated the attending Physician, in consultation with the Psychiatrist would prepare a referral with the signature of the consulting Psychiatrist, and if the patient was seen on an emergent basis, the ED records would be copied and  transferred with the patient.  It further revealed the Physician would determine the appropriate mode of transport, the supervision required, and the patient's medical condition, and in the ED, the nursing staff would arrange for the transport.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting,"" policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.

1. Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.

Observation of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.  

2.  Review of Patient #20's ED record revealed he/she arrived at the facility extension ED on 07/30/12 at 2:51 AM with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made and was escorted by law enforcement.  The Physician ED note listed unremarkable vital signs and negative/noncontributory review of systems.  It also listed a Psychiatric consult was done, a urine drug screen was presumptively positive, and the patient had an appropriate mood and behavior.  Patient #20 was transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  There was no documentation the receiving psychiatric facility had agreed to accept the transfer, had been sent the required hospital records, or that the patient had been transported appropriately and safely to the receiving psychiatric facility. The record revealed there was no facility transfer form.

Interview with the Enterprise ED Director and the facility RN ED Manager, on 01/31/13 at 4:25 PM, revealed both stated the facility extension ED had not been completing transfer forms that had required information for ED patients transferred to an external facility since 2010 when personnel were told they did not have to complete the transfer forms for an intra-facility transfer, (transfer from the facility to the facility extension.)  They both stated, at this point, the staff stopped completing any transfer forms for any patients, no matter where they were being transferred.  They further revealed the problem was discovered during an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Validation Survey conducted 01/14/13 through 01/18/13 and since the problem was identified, the facility had started completing transfer forms (one to go with patient and one to stay in ED record)  for patients transferred outside the facility system.

Confirmation of the facility extension completing a transfer form was accomplished by review of a closed ED record, Patient #9, which revealed he/she was seen in the facility extension ED on 01/27/13 with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made.  The record revealed this patient was transferred on 01/27/13 to an external psychiatric facility.  The record also revealed it contained a ""Transfer Agreement"" that listed the medical condition of the patient, the reason for transfer, the approval of the receiving facility for transfer, the Physician accepting transfer, who received the patient report at the receiving facility, the transfer method, and treatment information.  This form must be signed by the Discharging Nurse.  This form also has a section for transfer of unstable patients with the required Physician completion and signature.







","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview, record review, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24 Special Responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases for two (2) of twenty-one (21) patients that presented to the facility extension Emergency Department (ED), Patients #1 and #20.  The facility extension failed to ensure a medical screening examination (MSE) was provided for Patient #1 on 01/12/13 after he/she was brought to their ambulance bay for treatment of a possible emergency medical condition. The facility extension failed to ensure an appropriate transfer was accomplished on 07/30/12 for Patient #20 when he/she was transferred to an external psychiatric facility. 

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who will investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.  Additionally, the policy revealed patients transferred to an external psychiatric facility must have a transfer form completed by the Physician, Social Worker (if applicable), and Nurse.  The policy further revealed the patient must be medically and psychiatrically stable before being transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  It stated the attending Physician, in consultation with the Psychiatrist would prepare a referral with the signature of the consulting Psychiatrist, and if the patient was seen on an emergent basis, the ED records would be copied and  transferred with the patient.  It further revealed the Physician would determine the appropriate mode of transport, the supervision required, and the patient's medical condition, and in the ED, the nursing staff would arrange for the transport.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting,"" policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

1. Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Observation of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.  

2.  Review of Patient #20's ED record revealed he/she arrived at the facility extension ED on 07/30/12 at 2:51 AM with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made and was escorted by law enforcement.  The Physician ED note listed unremarkable vital signs and negative/noncontributory review of systems.  It also listed a Psychiatric consult was done, a urine drug screen was presumptively positive, and the patient had an appropriate mood and behavior.  Patient #20 was transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  There was no documentation the receiving psychiatric facility had agreed to accept the transfer, had been sent the required hospital records, or that the patient had been transported appropriately and safely to the receiving psychiatric facility. The record revealed there was no facility transfer form.

Interview with the Enterprise ED Director and the facility RN ED Manager, on 01/31/13 at 4:25 PM, revealed both stated the facility extension ED had not been completing transfer forms that had required information for ED patients transferred to an external facility since 2010 when personnel were told they did not have to complete the transfer forms for an intra-facility transfer, (transfer from the facility to the facility extension.)  They both stated, at this point, the staff stopped completing any transfer forms for any patients, no matter where they were being transferred.  They further revealed the problem was discovered during an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Validation Survey conducted 01/14/13 through 01/18/13 and since the problem was identified, the facility had started completing transfer forms (one to go with patient and one to stay in ED record)  for patients transferred outside the facility system.

Confirmation of the facility extension completing a transfer form was accomplished by review of a closed ED record, Patient #9, which revealed he/she was seen in the facility extension ED on 01/27/13 with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made.  The record revealed this patient was transferred on 01/27/13 to an external psychiatric facility.  The record also revealed it contained a ""Transfer Agreement"" that listed the medical condition of the patient, the reason for transfer, the approval of the receiving facility for transfer, the Physician accepting transfer, who received the patient report at the receiving facility, the transfer method, and treatment information.  This form must be signed by the Discharging Nurse.  This form also has a section for transfer of unstable patients with the required Physician completion and signature.

Based on interview, record review, document review, and review of facility policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one (1) of twenty-one (21) patients selected for review and who had presented to the facility extension's Emergency Department (ED) seeking medical care received a medical screening examination (MSE), Patient #1.  A review of documentation in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance transport records revealed Patient #1 arrived at the facility extension ED ambulance bay on 01/12/13 at 7:58 PM and left per ambulance for the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM without disembarking from the ambulance or receiving a MSE because  facility extension ED personnel would not let Patient #1 enter the ED.

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who would investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting"", policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Review of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.

The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.

She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.

The findings include:

Review of current hospital policy ""Emergency Department Procedure In Receiving and Treating Ill or Injured Individuals"" Reference # 2.001, Reviewed/Revised 08/2014, revealed ""Purpose:  The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for compliance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act....and its implementing regulations and interpretive guidelines....in regard to screening and stabilization of patients with emergency medical conditions.  Policy:  Any individual who 'comes to the Emergency Department' shall be provided an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capacity of the Hospital, to determine whether or not an 'emergency medical condition' exists.  If such a condition does exist, the Hospital shall provide necessary stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer, if indicated. Definitions:  ...'Emergency medical condition' means either:  (1) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]... Procedures:  Guidelines:  EMTALA requires that when an individual comes to the Hospital with a suspected emergency medical condition, the Hospital must provide a medical screening examination that is reasonably calculated to identify the presence of an emergency medical condition.  If an emergency medical condition is identified, the Hospital must provide stabilizing treatment within its capabilities, including admission for inpatient care where appropriate.  If the Hospital is unable to fully stabilize the patient, it must arrange for an appropriate transfer to a facility with the necessary capabilities. ...Initial Assessment and Medical Screening Examination ...A Qualified Medical Professional (QMP) is a licensed physician with Emergency Department clinical privileges who is responsible for the medical screening examination.  The medical screening examination may also be conducted by an Emergency Department Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner acting within his/her scope of practice.  The examination must be reasonably calculated to determine whether an emergency medical condition exits.  The medical screening examination must be conducted utilizing not only all services within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, but also the ancillary services that are routinely available to the Emergency Department.  In other words, all appropriate Hospital resources must be used to pursue an accurate diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s capacity in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition.  If a patient requires transfer, the Hospital will stabilize the patient to the best of its ability prior to such transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with Hospital Policy. ...Discharge.  Disposition of the patient is the responsibility of the physician.  A patient shall not be discharged    with an unstabilized emergency medical condition.  An individual is considered stable and ready for discharge when, within reasonable clinical confidence, it is determined that the individual has reached the point where his/her continued care, including diagnostic work-up and/or treatment, could be reasonably performed as an outpatient or later as an inpatient, provided the individual is given a plan for appropriate follow-up care as part of the discharge instructions.  The emergency medical condition that caused the individual to present to the Emergency Department must be resolved, but the underlying medical condition may persist. ...""

Policy:  Any individual who 'comes to the Emergency Department' shall be provided an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capacity of the Hospital, to determine whether or not an 'emergency medical condition' exists.  If such a condition does exist, the Hospital shall provide necessary stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer, if indicated. Definitions:  ...'Emergency medical condition' means either:  (1) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]... Procedures:  Guidelines:  EMTALA requires that when an individual comes to the Hospital with a suspected emergency medical condition, the Hospital must provide a medical screening examination that is reasonably calculated to identify the presence of an emergency medical condition.  If an emergency medical condition is identified, the Hospital must provide stabilizing treatment within its capabilities, including admission for inpatient care where appropriate.  If the Hospital is unable to fully stabilize the patient, it must arrange for an appropriate transfer to a facility with the necessary capabilities. ...Initial Assessment and Medical Screening Examination ...A Qualified Medical Professional (QMP) is a licensed physician with Emergency Department clinical privileges who is responsible for the medical screening examination.  The medical screening examination may also be conducted by an Emergency Department Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner acting within his/her scope of practice.  The examination must be reasonably calculated to determine whether an emergency medical condition exits.  The medical screening examination must be conducted utilizing not only all services within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, but also the ancillary services that are routinely available to the Emergency Department.  In other words, all appropriate Hospital resources must be used to pursue an accurate diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s capacity in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition.  If a patient requires transfer, the Hospital will stabilize the patient to the best of its ability prior to such transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with Hospital Policy. ...Discharge.

An individual is considered stable and ready for discharge when, within reasonable clinical confidence, it is determined that the individual has reached the point where his/her continued care, including diagnostic work-up and/or treatment, could be reasonably performed as an outpatient or later as an inpatient, provided the individual is given a plan for appropriate follow-up care as part of the discharge instructions.

Based on review of hospital policy and procedure, record review and staff interview, the hospital failed to appropriately assess and stabilize a mental health patient prior to sending them to the Mental Health Crisis Office (Patient #26); failed to ensure that  individuals entering the building seeking medical assistance were initially screened by qualified staff; and failed to specify in hospital regulations or bylaws which medically qualified personnel had been determined qualified to conduct emergency medical screening exams (MSEs). 

Failure to provide screening by a qualified staff member as defined by the Hospital's Governing Body, risked patient health and safety.

Findings were:

Review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled ""Patient Transfers (Evaluation, Stabilization, and Transfer) EMTALA"" [Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act], Policy #KGH 9 Revised 08/17 showed that any individual who presented to the Women's and Children's Hospital (Auburn Campus) and requested or had a request made on his or her behalf for an examination or treatment of a medical condition; or presented with appearance or behavior suggesting the individual needed emergency treatment, would be assessed by ""qualified medical personnel."" The definition of ""qualified medical personnel"" included a physician, registered nurse, advanced registered nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or certified registered nurse anesthetist.
Qualified medical personal would initiate treatment to stabilize the patient, call an ambulance to arrange transfer of the patient to a facility that could meet the medical needs of the patient, call the emergency physician on duty at the Southridge campus, and notify the hospital supervisor.

1. Failed to appropriately assess and stabilize a mental health patient prior to sending them to the Mental Health Crisis Office for 1 of 1 mental health patients reviewed (Patient #26).

Review of the Women and Children's Hospital Walk In Disposition Log documented that Patient #26 was a mental health patient who arrived seeking Mental Health assistance on 9/26/18 at 8:40 AM with her boyfriend. The House Supervisor provided initial screening and contacted the Mental Health Crisis Office who spoke by phone with the boyfriend. The Office recommended that the boyfriend take the patient to the Crisis Office.

No medical screening exam was provided to rule out an emergency medical condition. The hospital failed to assess and stabilize the patient prior to discharge. 


2. Failed to have procedures formulated, implemented and reviewed; and  Failed to provide qualified staff for initial screening

During a tour of the Women and Children's hospital on [DATE], the Security guard was asked how walk-in patients looking for emergency services were handled. He showed the investigator an email from the Director of the Family Birth Center and algorithm dated 10/26/18 which directed that individuals who arrived looking for emergency care at the Women and Children's Hospital would no longer be assessed by a clinical staff member.

Review of the email issued 10/26/18 showed that the patients who arrived looking for emergency care were to be interviewed by the security guard on duty:
If the patient stated she was pregnant, the patient would be taken to the Family Birth Center unit located in the building. 
If the patient stated he or she was not pregnant, the security guard was to ask the patient what the person needed. 
The security guard was to determine if the presenting problem was a ""minor problem"" or a ""serious problem.""
If the security guard determined it was a ""minor problem,"" the patient would be given a map and instructions regarding how to get to the Southridge campus emergency department, which was five miles away. 
If the security guard determined the patient had a ""serious problem,"" the guard was to call 911 for an ambulance. 
If an ambulance was summoned, the guard was to call the Family Birth Center, and a nursing staff member would ""come and sit with the patient"" until the ambulance arrived. The individual was not to be taken to the Family Birth Center and ""put in a bed.""
If the individual had a cardiac arrest, the security guard was to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation and call 911. 

He stated there was a case (Patient #25) that required 911 to be called on 12/6/18. He stated the patient had been found ""down"" and unresponsive on the Women and Children's Hospital Campus on 12/6/18 by a passer-by who came in seeking assistance. The Security Guard called 911 per the new algorithm issued 10/26/18, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the Trios Southridge ED where they were provided a medical screening exam and treatment. The patient was admitted     for on-going care.

On 12/14/18 at 9 AM during an interview, the interim nursing director stated the entire procedure was currently under review by administration and medical staff, but remained in rough draft form. No changes had been made from the revised directive dated 10/26/18.

3. Failed to have  language in by-laws, approved by the Governing Body that specified which medically qualified personnel had been determined qualified to conduct emergency medical screening exams (MSEs). 

Review of Hospital Regulations failed to evidence language that specified which medically qualified personnel had been determined qualified to conduct emergency medical screening exams (MSEs).  Staff interview on 12/14/18 verified that there was no specific directive in Hospital Regulations or Bylaws.
