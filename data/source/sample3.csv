Based on documentation review and staff interviews, critical access hospital's (CAH) Emergency Department (ED) staff failed to an adequate medical screening examination within the CAH's capabilities prior to discharging or transferring 2 of 30 sampled patients that presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation of possible emergency medical conditions (Patient #14 and #25). The administrative staff identified average of 18 patients per day who requested emergency medical care at the facility's dedicated emergency department.

Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination within the CAH's capabilities resulted in the CAH ED staff transferring a pregnant patient by her own car, without first determining if she could safely travel between the facilities and would not deliver her baby without medical staff present to assist her if she began to deliver the baby. Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination also resulted in the CAH's ED staff discharging a patient complaining of left sided chest pain, without determining the cause of the chest pain, and who was found dead 2 days later.

Findings included:

1. Review of the policy ""Obstetrical Patient, Assessment and Management,"" revised 5/2015, revealed in part, ""The medical screening for an obstetrical patient with chief complaint related to pregnancy will include fetal well-being and labor status in addition to the standard assessment parameters of an ER  assessment.""  The section Early/False Labor directed the nurse to ""provide for and assist the physician with a sterile vaginal exam to determine: cervical dilation [the cervix normally opens to 10 cm prior to delivery], effacement [the cervix changes position as the baby moves closer to delivery], fetal descent [the baby's location in the birth canal], status of amniotic membranes [if the patient's water broke]."" 

2. Review of the policy ""Patient Transfers...EMTALA,"" revised 5/2015, revealed in part, ""Patients may be transferred to another hospital facility when: Evaluation and stabilization has been done in the Emergency Department..."" ""Patient is not in active labor with delivery imminent.""

3. Review of Patient #14's closed ED medical record revealed that Patient #14 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 6/01 PM, complaining of vaginal bleeding and low abdominal and back pain every 10 minutes.  Patient #14 was 37 weeks pregnant (nearly full term and ready to deliver the baby at any time).  Patient #14 reported she saw her obstetrician (OB, a doctor who specialized in care of pregnant patients) approximately 5 hours prior to presenting to the ED. Patient #14 reported she was was 3 centimeters (cm) dilated and 80% effaced.  (At the time of delivery, the cervix is 10 cm dilated and 100% effaced).

Further review of the medical record revealed ED staff checked the fetal heart tones with initial fetal heart tone rate of 136 beats per minute.  Registered Nurse (RN) B checked a box in Patient #14's medical record labeled ""pelvic exam"" to indicate the ED physician performed a pelvic examination in the presence of RN B. The ED record lacked specific assessment information from the pelvic examination, including if Patient #14 was likely to imminently deliver the baby, if her water had broken, how far dilated the cervix was, the position of the cervix (effacement), location of the baby in the birth canal, or if Patient #14's water broke. RN B documented Patient #14 experienced cramps every 10 minutes.

Patient #14's medical record revealed the CAH staff provided transfer/discharge instructions on 2/23/17 at 7:00 PM. The discharge instructions told Patient #14 to drive their own vehicle to another hospital with specialized obstetrical capabilities approximately 73 miles from the sending CAH.

4. During an interview on 6/7/17 at 4:20 PM, RN B stated Patient #14 presented to the ED complaining of vaginal bleeding and this was her first pregnancy. RN B determined Patient #14 did not have active vaginal bleeding because RN B did not observe blood when Patient #14 changed her clothes. Physician's Assistant (PA) C visualized Patient #14's external genitalia, so RN B ""checked"" the box indicating PA C performed a pelvic exam. PA C did not complete a pelvic examination and/or insert his fingers into Patient #14's vagina to assess Patient #14's cervix. While PA C performed his examination, RN B was in the ED room with Patient #14 and did not observe what RN B believed were contractions. RN B stated Patient #14 did not exhibit what RN B believed were signs of labor such as ""excessive nervousness or fear of impending doom.""

RN B acknowledged the CAH lacked a device to monitor contractions. Patient #14 was in the ED for 59 minutes and RN B did not provide continuous observation of Patient #14. RN B acknowledged she could possibly fail to observe Patient #14 have a contraction, although Patient #14 denied experiencing contractions. RN B stated possible signs of labor included low back pain or low abdominal pain. RN B acknowledged she lacked experience working with obstetrical patients and her only experience with obstetrical patients was 8 years prior in nursing school.

5. During an interview on 6/7/17 at 2:08 PM, PA C stated Patient #14 presented to the ED complaining of vaginal bleeding and low abdominal pain/cramping, who was 37 weeks along in her pregnancy (full term is between 36 to 40 weeks). PA C failed to perform an internal pelvic examination because if Patient #14 was in active labor, the CAH did not provide labor and delivery services. PA C chose to defer performing the pelvic examination so an obstetrician at another hospital with more experience with pregnancy could examine Patient #14 at the receiving hospital.

PA C performed a medical screening examination of Patient #14's head, chest, abdomen, and a visual examination of Patient #14's external genitalia. PA C did not remember if Patient #14's water broke and can not recall if he checked for the presence of amniotic fluid, but acknowledged he did not document either way if he checked for amniotic fluid. PA C reviewed his findings with Obstetrician F at the receiving hospital, and they determined Patient #14 could safely transfer to the receiving hospital by her own vehicle. PA C stated he performed emergent deliveries in the past.

6. Review of PA C's credential file (a personnel file for PAs, ARNPs, and physicians) revealed the following:

a. PA C successfully completed continuing medical education (CME) that included obstetrical emergencies on 11/25/14.
b. The CAH's governing body granted PA C permission to perform emergent vaginal births on 9/29/15.

7. During an interview on 6/7/17 at 2:45 PM, Physician E stated he provided oversight to PA C. Physician E signed Patient #14's medical record to indicate Physician E was available to PA C by phone and reviewed Patient #14's medical record. Physician E stated if PA C was uncomfortable performing a procedure such as a pelvic examination, PA C should contact Physician E and Physician E would go to the ED and assess the patient.

Physician E stated if a patient presented at 37 week gestation, her cervix was dilated to 3 cm (out of a maximum of 10 cm), was 80% effaced (out of 100% and fully ready to give birth), experiencing low abdominal/back pain every 10 minutes that lasted 1 minute, the patient could be in labor. Physician E stated PA C should have performed a pelvic examination prior to transferring Patient #14 to another hospital. 

8. Review of the policy ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE),"" reviewed 5/2017, revealed in part, ""Purpose: To ensure that any individual who comes to the Hospital, and on whose behalf a request for examination or treatment for a medical condition is made, an appropriate medical screening examination shall be provided ... and within the capabilities of the Emergency Department (and ancillary services routinely available to the Emergency Department) to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists ...A physician or [nurse practitioner]  ... shall be called to perform the medical screening examination in the event that any of the following symptoms or conditions is identified: ... Chest Pain ...""

9. Review of Patient #25's closed medical record revealed Patient #25 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on 5/2/17 at 10:25 AM complaining of left sided chest pain.  Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) H ordered a chest x-ray. The chest x-ray did not reveal any broken ribs. ARNP H failed to order any further diagnostic testing to determine the cause of Patient #25's chest pain. According to the record review upon returning from radiology following the chest x-ray to evaluate the rib pain, staff documented Patient #25 was sitting up in a wheelchair and vomited. ARNP H discharged    Patient #25 on 5/2/17 at 11:43 AM with rib pain and a recent vomiting episode. Patient #25 left the ER  with a friend. 

10. During an interview on 6/7/2017 at 4:30 PM, ARNP H revealed he ordered a check X-ray to rule out fractured ribs and pneumonia. He did not do any further testing to determine reason for Patient #25's continued chest pain, nausea and dizziness. ARNP H stated he knew Patient #25 was diabetic and ARNP H did not perform any testing to check Patient #25's blood sugar level.

11. During an interview on 6/7/2017 at 2:00 PM, Physician K revealed he would have performed laboratory testing, including checking Patient #25's blood sugar, performed a check x-ray, and further laboratory testing to identify the cause of Patient #25's chest discomfort. Physician K stated until he received the information from the testing, he could not know if Patient #25 was experiencing something minor like a muscle strain or something major like a heart attack.

12. During an interview on 6/7/2017 at 2:45 PM, Physician L revealed he would have performed a 12-leak EKG (a detailed look at the heart's electrical system which can show if the patient was having a heart attack), ordered a chest x-ray, and ordered laboratory testing to determine the cause of the symptoms.

13. Review of the death certificate revealed Patient #25 died    in his/her home on 5/4/17. Physician L signed the death certificate and listed Patient #25's cause of death as ""sudden cardiac arrest syndrome.""

Based on staff interviews, Emergency Department (ED) record review and policies and procedures (P&P) review, the hospital failed to provide stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of the staff and the facility for a psychiatric patient awaiting transfer, for 1 of 20 patients reviewed (Patient 9). Patient 9 was not provided clinical care by the hospital while restrained in the ED by Police Department (PD) staff awaiting Mental Health (MH) evaluation and subsequent transfer.  

Findings: 

The ED log review showed that on 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. Patient 9 presented to the ED with chief complaint of psychiatric issues and was diagnosed    with ""Acute bipolar disorder (manic state); psychosis; Near term pregnancy."" The disposition section documented that Patient 9 was transferred on 9/22/12 at 12:50 p.m. The review of ED nursing notes showed that Patient 9 remained in the ED for 33 hours form 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. until 9/22/12 at 15: 50 p.m., when the patient was transferred to another hospital (Hospital 3).                                                 

Review of ED nursing notes indicated that while in the ED awaiting transfer, Patient 9 was physically restrained (hand-cuffed) by a county sheriff officer (SO). The hospital provided documentation that on 9/21/12 at 3:50 a.m. Patient 9 was placed by the county sheriff on an involuntary hold under the Welfare and Institution (W&I) Code 5150 for the purpose of examination by mental health professionals at the hospital (Hospital 1) because there was a probable cause that the patient was ""a danger to himself/herself."" There was no record that Patient 9 was arrested or was in the police custody (an inmate). The record showed that on 9/22/12 at 12:50 p.m. the patient was transferred via ambulance to Hospital 3. 

Review of the P&P titled ""Psychiatric Behavioral Assessment Documentation"" (revised 9/09) indicated, ""All patients that present to the ED with a primary diagnosis of behavioral, emotional, suicidal, or homicidal ideations will have a Behavioral Assessment Tool completed."" The policy also indicated that ""Law enforcement will be notified to provide security for staff, physicians, and patients. The physician will write an order for Mental Health Consultation. 

The ""ED Psychiatric Protocol -Assessment Tool"" attached to the policy indicated that patients presenting with complaints including those of wanting to die/kill self, violent behavior toward self or others, psychotic, bizarre behaviors met triage level 1 or 2 and interventions should be implemented such as placement in the room, clothing and belongings removed, and the physician notified of patient arrival. For patients triage level 1 per the tool (all suicidal patients, agitated patient, potential danger to self or others or paranoid patients) patients should have 15 minutes checks initiated and continued until discharge, the physician should be notified of patient immediately and call for Mental Health consult done. 

There was no documentation that Patient 9 was placed on suicide precautions until 9/22/12 at 6:40 a.m. (27 hours after admission), when a nursing note documented that suicide precautions were initiated for Patient 9 with the following interventions: one on one supervision, hospital security officer at bedside, every 15 minutes checks performed, clothing/valuables removed and placed at the nurse's station, patient in view of the nurse's station. Review of orders showed no order written for Mental Health Consultation as per the policy above.

There was no documentation in Patient 9's record for the 15 minutes checks performed as noted above.

Review of County Sheriffs' report dated 9/21/12 (provided to the Department by the hospital) showed that at approximately 2:17 a.m. an officer was dispatched to a disturbance apparently caused by Patient 9. Patient 9 was placed on 5150 hold due to her mental status and was brought to Hospital 2 for mental health evaluation and care. The officer documented that ""while waiting for mental health to arrive, (name of Patient 9) told me numerous times that she wanted to kill herself... As of 0600 (6 a.m.) hours, when I was relieved of my duties, we were still awaiting the arrival of Mental Health to take custody of (name of Patient 9).

The ED nursing notes documentation contained the following entries showing that Patient 9 was physically restrained by the police officer throughout the stay in the ED while awaiting mental health evaluation and transfer:

9/21/12 at 2:55 a.m. - patient is restless and handcuffed to side rail with officer in room
9/21/12 at 7:28 a.m. - patient remains cuffed to bed with SO (sheriff officer) at bedside
9/21/12 at 8:30 a.m. - SO remains at bedside. Pt remains cuffed
9/22/12 at 7:30 a.m. - patient returned to room, cuffed to gurney, officer at bedside 
9/22/12 at 10:10 a.m. - patient back to room with security at bedside and cuff in place

The nursing notes documentation showed that during Patient 9's 33 hour ED stay while awaiting transfer, only twice was the patient released from cuffs and provided with any range of motion:

9/22/12 at 7:19 a.m. - security walking with patient in the ED per patient request. Patient states she is stiff from being on gurney
9/22/12 at 9:52 a.m. - Security supervising patient walking again in the ED

Review of the hospital policy titled ""Restraints Management- Medical Restraints and Behavioral Restraints"" (reviewed 3/12) indicated the following: Patients have the right to be free from restraints of any form that are not medically necessary. There needs to be a clear rationale for the use of restraints and all other solutions to the problem must be considered. Alternatives to restraint use include companionship (staff or family stay with patient). The policy indicated that ""forensic (pertaining to courts of law) handcuffs"" were authorized to be used by law enforcement and the law enforcement officer was responsible for the use, application and monitoring of theses restrictive devices, however, ""Clinical care of an individual under forensic or correctional restrictions was to be provided by the hospital's clinical staff."" 

The above policy fell    short in describing what and how the clinical care was to be provided by hospital staff for patients restrained by police without the patient being under arrest, while the patient was determined to have a medical emergency condition of psychiatric nature and was awaiting mental health evaluation and care. 

In an interview on 4/11/13 at 1 p.m. the Quality Director stated that although the hospital indicated in their P&Ps that the law enforcement officers were to be used for security and safety of their patients, there was no formal written agreement that would indicate that the police or sheriff's department agreed to provide those services and under what circumstances those services were to be provided, or if/how the patient care would be coordinated with clinical staff to ensure proper patient care. 

Review of the nursing notes showed that from the presentation to the ED on 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. to transfer on 9/22/12 at 12:50 p.m. the patient was not offered adequate nutrition. The following meals and fluids were documented as offered to the patient on 9/21/12:

9/21/12 at 7:36 a.m. - po (by mouth fluids given)
9/21/12 at 7:50 a.m. - sandwich given

There was no documentation that Patient 9 was provided lunch or dinner, or snacks and fluids at any other time on 9/21/12. The next meal provided to Patient 9 was documented on 9/22/12 at 8 a.m. (breakfast tray provided, noted at 8:15 a.m. that patient ate 100%), and then on 9/22/12 two more entries regarding meals/nutrition were documented in the nursing notes: at 9:44 a.m. - turkey sandwich and milk provided and at 11:58 a.m. - lunch tray given. 
  
There was no documentation that Patient 9 was provided with any hygiene or toileting opportunities while restraint.

In a collaborative interview with the L&D Manager, ED Manager, QA Director and OB physician, MD 4 on 4/11/13 starting at 1 p.m., the staff confirmed that although on 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. Patient 9 was brought in to the hospital by the police on 5150 hold, the patient was not criminally charged (not arrested and was not an inmate). The administration staff stated that the local police was routinely called in and assisted the hospital with patient safety and monitoring as a courtesy service; however, there was no written agreement between the hospital and the police or sheriff's department(s) for the their officers to monitor patients receiving care in the ED. The hospital had an agreement for county inmate patients only. The hospital had a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the county and the county was to provide a guard and supervise an inmate under a penal code. This MOU did not apply to other ED patients. 

In the above interview, the ED Manager stated that patients needing behavioral restraint needed an initial assessment, a physician order for restraints, and ongoing evaluation and monitoring while the patient was restrained. The ED Manager acknowledged that no order for restraints was written for Patient 9, no Behavioral Assessment Tool was completed, no suicide precautions and ongoing monitoring with 15 minute checks was timely initiated and 15 minute checks were not documented in Patient 9's ED record. The ED Manager acknowledged that there was no documentation that Patient 9's care was provided that addressed the patient's physical needs (nutritional needs, providing range of motion for restrained limbs and extremity assessment related to cuffs/restraints) and mental status (monitoring of the patient's ongoing behaviors) as required per hospital policies.

The hospital provided documentation that on 9/21/12 at 3:50 a.m. Patient 9 was placed by the county sheriff on an involuntary hold under the Welfare and Institution (W&I) Code 5150 for the purpose of examination by mental health professionals at the hospital (Hospital 1) because there was a probable cause that the patient was ""a danger to himself/herself."" There was no record that Patient 9 was arrested or was in the police custody (an inmate). The record showed that on 9/22/12 at 12:50 p.m. the patient was transferred via ambulance to Hospital 3. 

Review of the P&P titled ""Psychiatric Behavioral Assessment Documentation"" (revised 9/09) indicated, ""All patients that present to the ED with a primary diagnosis of behavioral, emotional, suicidal, or homicidal ideations will have a Behavioral Assessment Tool completed."" The policy also indicated that ""Law enforcement will be notified to provide security for staff, physicians, and patients. The physician will write an order for Mental Health Consultation. 

The ""ED Psychiatric Protocol -Assessment Tool"" attached to the policy indicated that patients presenting with complaints including those of wanting to die/kill self, violent behavior toward self or others, psychotic, bizarre behaviors met triage level 1 or 2 and interventions should be implemented such as placement in the room, clothing and belongings removed, and the physician notified of patient arrival. For patients triage level 1 per the tool (all suicidal patients, agitated patient, potential danger to self or others or paranoid patients) patients should have 15 minutes checks initiated and continued until discharge, the physician should be notified of patient immediately and call for Mental Health consult done. 

There was no documentation that Patient 9 was placed on suicide precautions until 9/22/12 at 6:40 a.m. (27 hours after admission), when a nursing note documented that suicide precautions were initiated for Patient 9 with the following interventions: one on one supervision, hospital security officer at bedside, every 15 minutes checks performed, clothing/valuables removed and placed at the nurse's station, patient in view of the nurse's station. Review of orders showed no order written for Mental Health Consultation as per the policy above.

There was no documentation in Patient 9's record for the 15 minutes checks performed as noted above.

Review of County Sheriffs' report dated 9/21/12 (provided to the Department by the hospital) showed that at approximately 2:17 a.m. an officer was dispatched to a disturbance apparently caused by Patient 9. Patient 9 was placed on 5150 hold due to her mental status and was brought to Hospital 2 for mental health evaluation and care. The officer documented that ""while waiting for mental health to arrive, (name of Patient 9) told me numerous times that she wanted to kill herself... As of 0600 (6 a.m.) hours, when I was relieved of my duties, we were still awaiting the arrival of Mental Health to take custody of (name of Patient 9).

The ED nursing notes documentation contained the following entries showing that Patient 9 was physically restrained by the police officer throughout the stay in the ED while awaiting mental health evaluation and transfer:

9/21/12 at 2:55 a.m. - patient is restless and handcuffed to side rail with officer in room
9/21/12 at 7:28 a.m. - patient remains cuffed to bed with SO (sheriff officer) at bedside
9/21/12 at 8:30 a.m. - SO remains at bedside. Pt remains cuffed
9/22/12 at 7:30 a.m. - patient returned to room, cuffed to gurney, officer at bedside 
9/22/12 at 10:10 a.m. - patient back to room with security at bedside and cuff in place

The nursing notes documentation showed that during Patient 9's 33 hour ED stay while awaiting transfer, only twice was the patient released from cuffs and provided with any range of motion:

9/22/12 at 7:19 a.m. - security walking with patient in the ED per patient request. Patient states she is stiff from being on gurney
9/22/12 at 9:52 a.m. - Security supervising patient walking again in the ED

Review of the hospital policy titled ""Restraints Management- Medical Restraints and Behavioral Restraints"" (reviewed 3/12) indicated the following: Patients have the right to be free from restraints of any form that are not medically necessary. There needs to be a clear rationale for the use of restraints and all other solutions to the problem must be considered. Alternatives to restraint use include companionship (staff or family stay with patient). The policy indicated that ""forensic (pertaining to courts of law) handcuffs"" were authorized to be used by law enforcement and the law enforcement officer was responsible for the use, application and monitoring of theses restrictive devices, however, ""Clinical care of an individual under forensic or correctional restrictions was to be provided by the hospital's clinical staff."" 

The above policy fell    short in describing what and how the clinical care was to be provided by hospital staff for patients restrained by police without the patient being under arrest, while the patient was determined to have a medical emergency condition of psychiatric nature and was awaiting mental health evaluation and care. 

In an interview on 4/11/13 at 1 p.m. the Quality Director stated that although the hospital indicated in their P&Ps that the law enforcement officers were to be used for security and safety of their patients, there was no formal written agreement that would indicate that the police or sheriff's department agreed to provide those services and under what circumstances those services were to be provided, or if/how the patient care would be coordinated with clinical staff to ensure proper patient care. 

Review of the nursing notes showed that from the presentation to the ED on 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. to transfer on 9/22/12 at 12:50 p.m. the patient was not offered adequate nutrition. The following meals and fluids were documented as offered to the patient on 9/21/12:

9/21/12 at 7:36 a.m. - po (by mouth fluids given)
9/21/12 at 7:50 a.m. - sandwich given

There was no documentation that Patient 9 was provided lunch or dinner, or snacks and fluids at any other time on 9/21/12. The next meal provided to Patient 9 was documented on 9/22/12 at 8 a.m. (breakfast tray provided, noted at 8:15 a.m. that patient ate 100%), and then on 9/22/12 two more entries regarding meals/nutrition were documented in the nursing notes: at 9:44 a.m. - turkey sandwich and milk provided and at 11:58 a.m. - lunch tray given. 
  
There was no documentation that Patient 9 was provided with any hygiene or toileting opportunities while restraint.

In a collaborative interview with the L&D Manager, ED Manager, QA Director and OB physician, MD 4 on 4/11/13 starting at 1 p.m., the staff confirmed that although on 9/21/12 at 2:53 a.m. Patient 9 was brought in to the hospital by the police on 5150 hold, the patient was not criminally charged (not arrested and was not an inmate). The administration staff stated that the local police was routinely called in and assisted the hospital with patient safety and monitoring as a courtesy service; however, there was no written agreement between the hospital and the police or sheriff's department(s) for the their officers to monitor patients receiving care in the ED. The hospital had an agreement for county inmate patients only. The hospital had a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the county and the county was to provide a guard and supervise an inmate under a penal code. This MOU did not apply to other ED patients. 

In the above interview, the ED Manager stated that patients needing behavioral restraint needed an initial assessment, a physician order for restraints, and ongoing evaluation and monitoring while the patient was restrained. The ED Manager acknowledged that no order for restraints was written for Patient 9, no Behavioral Assessment Tool was completed, no suicide precautions and ongoing monitoring with 15 minute checks was timely initiated and 15 minute checks were not documented in Patient 9's ED record. The ED Manager acknowledged that there was no documentation that Patient 9's care was provided that addressed the patient's physical needs (nutritional needs, providing range of motion for restrained limbs and extremity assessment related to cuffs/restraints) and mental status (monitoring of the patient's ongoing behaviors) as required per hospital policies.

Based on review of the facility policy, call center documentation, ambulance run report, medical record (MR), Obstetrician triage daily assignments, and interviews, it was determined Baptist Medical Center East (BMC-E, Hospital A) failed to ensure the on-call Obstetrician accepted Patient Identifier (PI) # 1, a 37 week pregnant patient in active labor, when contacted by the transferring hospital (Hospital B) which had no labor and delivery (L&D) services, when BMC-E had the capability and capacity to treat the patient. 

This deficient practice affected 1 of 1 emergency transfer requests, who were appropriate for transfer to the facility and, which BMC-E had the capability and capacity to treat. There was no documentation provided of other incoming transfer requests for transfer to BMC-E from April 2019 through October 2019. This did affect PI # 1, and had the potential to affect all pregnant patients with a request for transfer to BMC-E Obstetric services.

Findings include:

Baptist Health Patient Care Policy and Procedure 
Emergency Department
Title: Patient Management Screening, Stabilization Transfer, Consultation and Referral
Review Dates: 12/17

Policy
To ensure that all patients are evaluated, and/or stabilized for transfer to another facility or discharged    to home, in a safe, efficient manner consistent with EMTALA guidelines. This policy is adapted from EMTALA and applies to Health Care Providers, nursing staff, and hospital.

Emergency Medical Condition:
An individual has an emergency medical condition if his/her medical condition is marked by acute symptoms or sufficient severity, including severe pain, or the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonable (reasonably) be expected to result in:
Placing the person's health in serious jeopardy, Serious impairment of body function; or Serious dysfunction of any body organ or part.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING PREGNANT WOMEN:
Women in active pre-term labor or other conditions that pose a threat to the health or safety to the mother and fetus will be presumed to have an emergency medical condition. ALL EMTALA guidelines apply to labor and delivery.

Hospital B (transferring hospital) documentation:

PI # 1 presented to Hospital B's emergency department (ED) via ambulance on 7/10/19 at 12:34 AM with a chief complaint of labor pains. The ED physician, evaluated the patient at 12:37 AM and documented that PI # 1's water was not broken, the initial pelvic exam did not show any blood or fluid. The baby's head could be felt at the pelvic inlet. It was not visible at the introitus. The ED physician was uncertain of how far dilated PI # 1 was. PI # 1 was scheduled for elective C-section (cesarean section) on 07/23/19, which would make the patient about 37 weeks. PI # 1 had a previous low transverse C-section. The ED physician further documented, he/she spoke with PI #1's primary OB physician and they ""both felt it might be more expedient (to) send her to Montgomery given the frequency of the contractions."" The ED physician then spoke with the On-call OB at BMC-E in Montgomery who advised since PI # 1 had an obstetrician which was negligible distance away (from BMC-E), that PI # 1 should be transferred to (hospital C, receiving hospital). PI # 1's primary OB physician at hospital C (receiving hospital) had agreed to accept the patient if BMC-E would not. 

The ED physician performed a second manual examination prior to the transfer of PI # 1 to Hospital C, receiving hospital, and documented the membranes felt intact and bulging, palpation of the baby's head was about 5 cm (centimeter) up from introitus. PI # 1 had ""no bleeding or gush of fluid but had passed probably a mucus plug by her/his history. Fetal heart tones 140....pre contractions about...4 minutes apart. Mucus plug passed ....in moderate acute distress in active labor ...manual pelvic exam shows initially some dilatation ...""

Review of the MR revealed a Patient Transfer Form and Physician Certification dated 7/10/19 for ambulance transport, ""...condition... active labor"", and a hospital to hospital transfer to (Hospital  C, receiving hospital). 

Review of the ED Nursing Documentation dated 7/10/19 at 1:40 AM, revealed ""pt (patient) in active labor, pelvic exam x 2 with last being just before departure, see MD note, iv (intravenous) [line] intact. OB kit with transporter. belongings with transporter. vital stable. pt agreeable and desires transfer where Epidural and or c-section can be provided. paperwork given to ems (emergency medical service) transport. water has not broken although pt has stated that she lost some mucus, occasional sensation of having BM (bowel movement)/void per pt..but has not voided or had BM thus far, report called. MD and transporter aware of all these findings.""

Review of the ED Provider Note dated 7/10/19 at 1:54 AM, revealed the following Plan:
Additional Treatments: Normal Saline
Disposition: Transferred
Reason for Transfer: Services not available
Receiving Facility: (Hospital C, receiving hospital identified) 
Receiving Physician: On-Call OB physician and Primary OB physician identified 
Mode of Transportation ALS (Advanced Life Support)
Evaluation Notes
""Patient was in active labor and contractions were every 3-4 minutes. She had not ruptured her membranes not bleeding. Fetal heart tones 140. Attempts to get her accepted at BMC-E ... were not successful. She was transferred by EMS (emergency medical service) to (On-Call OB physician) at hospital C. 


Hospital A, BMC-E, documentation : 

Review of the BMC-E Call Center Documentation dated 7/10/19 at 12:59 AM revealed a call was received from Hospital B (transferring hospital) ED physician with a request for the On-Call OB physician. BMC-E On-Call OB physician responded to the call from hospital B at 12:59 AM. There was no documentation of what the call was about or what the response was. 

Review of the OB Triage Daily Assignments from 7/10/19 at 12:30 AM through 7/10/19 at 3:00 AM revealed BMC-E had 3 of the 14 Labor and Delivery (L&D) beds occupied, leaving 11 L&D bed's available for an incoming transfer. 

There was no documentation the L&D was on diversion or of the reason BMC-E did not accept the transfer of PI # 1.

Ambulance Run Report documentation: 

Review of the ambulance run report dated 7/12/19 revealed the following documentation: 
EMS (Emergency Medical Service) arrived at hospital B (transferring hospital) on 7/10/19 at 01:38 AM to receive PI # 1 for ""immediate transport to (hospital C, receiving hospital) and left hospital B at 01:42 AM. Patient diagnosed    with... Normal delivery childbirth. Patient being transferred to specialized OB services, N/A (not available) at Hospital B. ""...Patient transfer refused by closer facilities due to patient's primary OB physician at transfer location. Upon arrival EMS found...contractions 2-3 minutes apart...Patient starts active labor during transport. Patient's amniotic bag ruptures and contractions continue. Patient has normal delivery during transport. Cord is clamped and cut. Patient has minimal bleeding post delivery following fundus massage...OB-childbirth - EMS personnel present at 7/10/19 2:18 AM...Patient was left in care of hospital C."" 

Further review of the ambulance run report revealed PI # 1 arrived at hospital C via EMS at 2:34 AM. 


Hospital C (receiving hospital) documentation: 

Review of  the History and Physical dated 7/10/19 at 03:23 AM revealed hospital C's On-Call OB documented PI # 1 presented to hospital C in a transfer from hospital B (transferring hospital) having delivered en route. Hospital C's On-Call OB documented PI # 1 began having contractions around 9:30 PM that evening and went to hospital B ED. PI # 1 had a history of previous C/S (c-section) for fetal distress with an unknown uterine incision. The ED physician at hospital B (transferring hospital) deemed the patient was in labor, called hospital C's (receiving hospital) Labor and Delivery, and spoke with PI # 1's primary OB ""who recommended she be transported to the nearest hospital with OB services. On-Call OB at BMC-E refused transfer. Hospital C's On-Call OB then documented he/she was called ""and echoed the recommendations of the primary OB physician but did agree that if there was no accepting hospital in Montgomery that we would care for her here."" PI # 1 ""delivered about 15 min (minute) prior to arrival at hospital C, receiving hospital. Per EMS report she had SROM (spontaneous rupture of membranes) in en route. Fluid was bloody. Delivery soon thereafter without dystocia (difficult birth) or cord. Baby had good color, cry, and heart rate.""

Review of the Hospital C's Discharge/Transfer Summary dated 7/12/19 revealed the discharge diagnosis IUP (intrauterine pregnancy) 37 plus weeks, vaginal delivery-VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Caesarean), in ambulance during transport, prior LTCS (Lower segment Caesarean section). VBAC enroute to the hospital of a 6 lb (pound) 11 ozs (ounce) ...


Interviews:

An interview was conducted on 10/7/19 at 10:43 AM with PI # 1 who verbalized the reason she/he went to hospital B (transferring hospital) was that while at work she went into labor and the ambulance took her there. PI # 1 verbalized she was seen by the physician in the ED who said she was in labor. PI # 1 voiced since there was no OB services at the  hospital and the ED physician recommend to send her to hospital C or Montgomery, whomever would accept me."" PI # 1 verbalized hospital B (transferring hospital) sent her to hospital C (receiving hospital). PI # 1 verbalized she did not have a preference/choice of where she was transferred on 10/7/19. 

An interview was conducted on 10/9/19 at 11:21 AM with EI # 4, ED physician at Hospital B (transferring hospital), who stated PI # 1 came to into hospital B after being at work in the area. EI # 4 stated, PI # 1 ""went into labor but didn't seek attention. We did a Medical Screen Exam (MSE) and pelvic exam. The babies head was not visible...I wasn't sure she would be able to deliver safely after C-Section. I felt going down I 65 was faster. I felt Montgomery was 15 min closer."" EI # 4 verbalized he did speak with EI # 1, (On-Call OB physician at BMC-E (hospital A) to request a transfer of PI # 1 to BMC-E (hospital A). EI # 4 stated, EI # 1 said ""she has a doctor you just need to send her there."" 

An interview was conducted on 10/9/19 at 1:21 PM with EI # 5, Paramedic, who performed the transfer of PI # 1 and delivery of the baby during the transfer. EI # 5 stated, ""The fire department brought the patient in to the ER  (emergency room   ). The ER  staff said they might have OB patient going out. So, we just hung out. Her contractions were about 5-10 mins apart. MD talked with patient about where OB was, the patient said hospital C's (receiving hospital) location. They called hospital C. My understanding, (hospital C) thought Montgomery was closer due to the hospital C's location being rural roads. The doctor (ED) called BMC-E... They didn't want the patient, from my understanding. So, the doctor called hospital C back. It would have been the same amount of time for any of those facilities."" 
  
EI # 5 was then asked if he/she knew or was told the reason for not transferring to BMC-E. EI # 5 stated, ""I wasn't in on the conversations. So, I don't know what the deal was. I was standing there when the doctor was talking to them. The ER  doctor was basically begging one to take the patient, I think it was (another hospital identified) but I'm not 100%. I don't know what they said but the patient wasn't accepted.""

An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 12:30 PM with EI # 1, OB on-call for BMC-E (hospital A) who stated, ""ED physician call(ed) had a pre-term labor previous C-Section which was 34 weeks. I asked who the primary OB was. I asked why have you not called them. He/She (EI # 4, ED physician for hospital B, transferring hospital) brought up that he called PI # 1's Primary OB first and the primary OB said if I wouldn't take the patient then the primary OB would. He (EI # 4) brought up there was about a 10 min difference between here and her (PI # 1) doctor. It's almost equal distance, so if she (PI # 1) has a doctor that can perform the services then she needs to see that doctor. So, continuity of care with primary doctor. I don't know if PI # 1's primary OB or EI # 4 was suggesting the patient come here. I don't know that...I don't recall if EI # 4 told me if she was dilated or not. It wasn't suggested she was in advanced labor...I just told EI # 4 it would be better for her to go to her primary doctor. I denied transfer because I though it would be better for her (PI# 1) to go to her primary doctor...""

An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 1:40 PM with EI # 3, On-Call OB for Hospital C (receiving hospital) who was on-call and admitted     PI # 1 to Hospital C. EI # 3 stated, PI # 1 ""was not accepted at another facility. PI # 1's primary OB had recommended transfer to the nearest facility, Montgomery. She (PI # 1) was in labor, it was closer. She (PI # 1) had a vaginal delivery enroute. I met her (PI # 1) at the hospital here, she had her baby in her arms."" EI # 3 was asked if he recalled what the reason for the transfer to hospital C (receiving hospital) was. EI # 3 stated, ""She wasn't accepted there because she had another OB provider."" 
 
An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 2:30 PM with EI # 2, Primary OB Provider, who verbalized she/he was not on call on 7/10/19 but was called by mistake. EI # 2 stated the following information was provided to her about PI # 1, ""She might be in early labor, in pain, not bleeding, sent there from her work. She was not near delivery. I wanted to transfer her... I told them to transfer to nearest facility. I called hospital C's (receiving hospital) L&D (labor and delivery) nurse and told her to fax prenatal records to hospital A (transferring hospital). EI # 4, ED physician at hospital B, and I had a conversation about (the) need to be transferred vs. monitored. They couldn't monitor the baby."" EI # 2 then verbalized she told hospital # 1's ED physician to send PI # 1 to nearest facility. EI # 2 then verbalized that hospital C (receiving hospital) was not nearest due to rural travel. 

EI # 2 was then asked if she received any additional call about PI # 1. EI # 2 stated, ""No, the next call was to (EI # 3, On-Call OB at hospital C, receiving hospital), he/she was actually on call OB at hospital C and took the second call after Montgomery facilities didn't accept the transfer..."" EI # 2 was asked when did you find out your patient wasn't transferred to the nearest Montgomery facility? EI # 2 stated, ""the next day on rounds. I saw the baby name on census. I thought it was a done deal, she'd go to Montgomery. End of the conversation. When I saw EI # 3 the next day, I asked what happened. EI # 3, said she delivered enroute VBAC, vaginal delivery in ambulance. The ED physician at Hospital B (transferring hospital) called (EI # 3) , said he couldn't send her to Montgomery, so (EI # 3) accepted the transfer to hospital C (receiving hospital), she couldn't stay in hospital B (transferring hospital). They couldn't monitor her baby.

PI # 1 had a history of previous C/S (c-section) for fetal distress with an unknown uterine incision. The ED physician at hospital B (transferring hospital) deemed the patient was in labor, called hospital C's (receiving hospital) Labor and Delivery, and spoke with PI # 1's primary OB ""who recommended she be transported to the nearest hospital with OB services. On-Call OB at BMC-E refused transfer.

Interviews:

An interview was conducted on 10/7/19 at 10:43 AM with PI # 1 who verbalized the reason she/he went to hospital B (transferring hospital) was that while at work she went into labor and the ambulance took her there. PI # 1 verbalized she was seen by the physician in the ED who said she was in labor. PI # 1 voiced since there was no OB services at the  hospital and the ED physician recommend to send her to hospital C or Montgomery, whomever would accept me."" PI # 1 verbalized hospital B (transferring hospital) sent her to hospital C (receiving hospital). PI # 1 verbalized she did not have a preference/choice of where she was transferred on 10/7/19. 

An interview was conducted on 10/9/19 at 11:21 AM with EI # 4, ED physician at Hospital B (transferring hospital), who stated PI # 1 came to into hospital B after being at work in the area. EI # 4 stated, PI # 1 ""went into labor but didn't seek attention. We did a Medical Screen Exam (MSE) and pelvic exam. The babies head was not visible...I wasn't sure she would be able to deliver safely after C-Section. I felt going down I 65 was faster. I felt Montgomery was 15 min closer."" EI # 4 verbalized he did speak with EI # 1, (On-Call OB physician at BMC-E (hospital A) to request a transfer of PI # 1 to BMC-E (hospital A). EI # 4 stated, EI # 1 said ""she has a doctor you just need to send her there."" 

An interview was conducted on 10/9/19 at 1:21 PM with EI # 5, Paramedic, who performed the transfer of PI # 1 and delivery of the baby during the transfer. EI # 5 stated, ""The fire department brought the patient in to the ER  (emergency room   ). The ER  staff said they might have OB patient going out. So, we just hung out. Her contractions were about 5-10 mins apart. MD talked with patient about where OB was, the patient said hospital C's (receiving hospital) location. They called hospital C. My understanding, (hospital C) thought Montgomery was closer due to the hospital C's location being rural roads. The doctor (ED) called BMC-E... They didn't want the patient, from my understanding. So, the doctor called hospital C back. It would have been the same amount of time for any of those facilities."" 
  
EI # 5 was then asked if he/she knew or was told the reason for not transferring to BMC-E. EI # 5 stated, ""I wasn't in on the conversations. So, I don't know what the deal was. I was standing there when the doctor was talking to them. The ER  doctor was basically begging one to take the patient, I think it was (another hospital identified) but I'm not 100%. I don't know what they said but the patient wasn't accepted.""

An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 12:30 PM with EI # 1, OB on-call for BMC-E (hospital A) who stated, ""ED physician call(ed) had a pre-term labor previous C-Section which was 34 weeks. I asked who the primary OB was. I asked why have you not called them. He/She (EI # 4, ED physician for hospital B, transferring hospital) brought up that he called PI # 1's Primary OB first and the primary OB said if I wouldn't take the patient then the primary OB would. He (EI # 4) brought up there was about a 10 min difference between here and her (PI # 1) doctor. It's almost equal distance, so if she (PI # 1) has a doctor that can perform the services then she needs to see that doctor. So, continuity of care with primary doctor. I don't know if PI # 1's primary OB or EI # 4 was suggesting the patient come here. I don't know that...I don't recall if EI # 4 told me if she was dilated or not. It wasn't suggested she was in advanced labor...I just told EI # 4 it would be better for her to go to her primary doctor. I denied transfer because I though it would be better for her (PI# 1) to go to her primary doctor...""

An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 1:40 PM with EI # 3, On-Call OB for Hospital C (receiving hospital) who was on-call and admitted     PI # 1 to Hospital C. EI # 3 stated, PI # 1 ""was not accepted at another facility. PI # 1's primary OB had recommended transfer to the nearest facility, Montgomery. She (PI # 1) was in labor, it was closer. She (PI # 1) had a vaginal delivery enroute. I met her (PI # 1) at the hospital here, she had her baby in her arms."" EI # 3 was asked if he recalled what the reason for the transfer to hospital C (receiving hospital) was. EI # 3 stated, ""She wasn't accepted there because she had another OB provider."" 
 
An interview was conducted on 10/10/19 at 2:30 PM with EI # 2, Primary OB Provider, who verbalized she/he was not on call on 7/10/19 but was called by mistake. EI # 2 stated the following information was provided to her about PI # 1, ""She might be in early labor, in pain, not bleeding, sent there from her work. She was not near delivery. I wanted to transfer her... I told them to transfer to nearest facility. I called hospital C's (receiving hospital) L&D (labor and delivery) nurse and told her to fax prenatal records to hospital A (transferring hospital). EI # 4, ED physician at hospital B, and I had a conversation about (the) need to be transferred vs. monitored. They couldn't monitor the baby."" EI # 2 then verbalized she told hospital # 1's ED physician to send PI # 1 to nearest facility. EI # 2 then verbalized that hospital C (receiving hospital) was not nearest due to rural travel. 

EI # 2 was then asked if she received any additional call about PI # 1. EI # 2 stated, ""No, the next call was to (EI # 3, On-Call OB at hospital C, receiving hospital), he/she was actually on call OB at hospital C and took the second call after Montgomery facilities didn't accept the transfer..."" EI # 2 was asked when did you find out your patient wasn't transferred to the nearest Montgomery facility? EI # 2 stated, ""the next day on rounds. I saw the baby name on census. I thought it was a done deal, she'd go to Montgomery. End of the conversation. When I saw EI # 3 the next day, I asked what happened. EI # 3, said she delivered enroute VBAC, vaginal delivery in ambulance. The ED physician at Hospital B (transferring hospital) called (EI # 3) , said he couldn't send her to Montgomery, so (EI # 3) accepted the transfer to hospital C (receiving hospital), she couldn't stay in hospital B (transferring hospital). They couldn't monitor her baby.

Based on observation, interview, and document review, the hospital failed to provide a medical screening examination (MSE) for 1 of 6 patients (P1), who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation of an obstetric emergency medical condition (EMC).

Findings include:

Observations of the hospital's ED on 01/19/16 at 9:50 a.m. established that the ED is comprised of three patient exam rooms with one bed each and a trauma bay with two beds. Exam room #3 is set up for patients who present with obstetric problems. Exam room #3 has obstetric examination supplies, a Doptone, neonatal emergency supplies, and an infant warmer. One RN was present in the ED at the time it was toured. 
RN/B was interviewed on 01/19/16 at 10:00 a.m. RN/B stated that the ED is staffed 24/7 with one RN. A mid-level provider is onsite in the ED, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After 5:00 p.m. weekdays, weekends, or holidays, the ED is staffed by on-call medical providers. A weekend is defined as beginning at 5:00 p.m. on Friday and extending through 8:00 a.m. on Monday. During weekends, the medical provider on-call is located onsite in an apartment that is attached to the hospital. The hospital does not have an Obstetric Department.P1 was interviewed on 01/25/16 at 12:54 p.m. P1 stated she woke up on 01/11/16 around 6:50 a.m. and had a considerable amount of vaginal bleeding. P1 also had a low backache. P1 was scared because she knew these were abnormal signs for a 30-week pregnancy. P1 took a picture of the bleeding and went to the nearest hospital, which was Swift County Benson Hospital (SCBH). P1 arrived at the SCBH ED around 7:00 a.m. A nurse greeted P1 at the ED door and had P1 sit in a chair in an exam room. The nurse offered to call P1's Obstetrician about P1's bleeding. The Nurse didn't examine P1 or look at the picture P1 had taken of the bleeding. The nurse left P1 in the exam room alone for about 5 minutes and then came back and told P1 to go to Hospital #2, which is where P1 had pre-planned to deliver her baby per her primary Obstetrician. P1 left the ED at SCBH and drove herself to Hospital #2, which is about a half hour away from SCBH. When P1 got to Hospital #2, a physician examined her. P1 was dilated to 4 or 5 cm and was in active labor. The physician at Hospital #2 told P1 she needed to go to Hospital #3 where there is a NICU for premature infants. Hospital #2 then sent P1 by ambulance to Hospital #3, which is over an hour from Hospital #2. When P1 got to Hospital #3, P1 was immediately admitted     to the inpatient Obstetric Department. P1 received medication for two days in attempt to stop the premature labor. On the second day at Hospital #3, P1's water broke and the baby flipped to a breech position. P1 had a C-section on 01/13/16. P1's baby was born at 31 weeks and weighed 3 pounds, 15 ounces. P1's baby was taken to the NICU. P1 was discharged    from Hospital #3 on 01/15/16. P1's baby remains in the NICU at Hospital #3 on ventilatory support.    

RN/F was interviewed on 01/20/16 at 9:00 a.m. RN/F stated she is an experienced ED nurse and worked the night shift of 01/10/16 - 01/11/16 from 7:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. During RN/F's 12-hour shift on 01/10/16 - 01/11/16, two patients presented to the ED seeking care for an EMC, P20 and P1. P20 presented at 6:30 a.m. with complaints of flank pain. RN/F escorted P20 to Exam Room #2, assessed P20, and notified the on-call medical provider of P20's arrival and need for a MSE. The on-call medical provider, MD/E, was onsite at the hospital and conducted P20's MSE about ten minutes later. MD/E then left the ED while results from P20's labs and U/A were pending. P1 then presented to the ED around 7:00 a.m. with complaints of vaginal bleeding. P1 was 30 weeks pregnant. P1 denied pain but was concerned about the bleeding. RN/F escorted P1 to Exam room #1. RN/F did not know why she did not room P1 in Exam room #3 which is set up for obstetric patients. RN/F did not assess P1. RN/F did not obtain P1's vital signs, check the amount or color of P1's vaginal bleeding, palpate P1's abdomen for possible uterine contractions, or check fetal heart tones. RN/F did not notify MD/E of P1's arrival and need for a MSE. Rather, RN/F asked P1 if P1 had notified her Obstetrician of the present problem with vaginal bleeding. P1 had not contacted her Obstetrician so RN/F offered to contact P1's Obstetrician, who was not the medical provider on-call and is not a medical provider on staff at the hospital. P1's Obstetrician is a medical provider on staff at Hospital #2. P1's Obstetrician directed RN/F to send P1 to Hospital #2 for evaluation. P1 left the hospital and went to Hospital #2, by private vehicle. Hospital #2 is approximately 32 miles away. After P1 left the hospital, RN/F went to the nurse's desk to check on the status of P20's labs. A nurse (unidentified) from Hospital #2 called and asked many questions about the condition and transfer status of P1, as Hospital #2 had been alerted by P1's Obstetrician that P1 was on her way there with an obstetric problem. It was then that RN/F realized she her error regarding the care of P1 and P1's unborn fetus. RN/F did not know why she failed to assess P1 or notify the on-call medical provider of P1's need for an obstetric MSE.  RN/F's normal practice is to thoroughly assess a patient based on the patient's presenting symptoms. RN/F's normal practice is to notify the medical provider on-call of all patients presenting to the ED with EMCs.  

MD/E was interviewed on 01/20/16 at 9:30 a.m. MD/E stated he was located onsite at the hospital from 5:00 p.m. on 01/08/16 to 8:00 a.m. on 01/11/16 as he was the medical provider on-call. Typically when patients present to the ED, the ED nurse gets the patient's vital signs, conducts a patient assessment based on symptoms, obtains a brief history, and then notifies him of the patient's arrival and need for the MSE. Typically all of the nurse's patient assessment data is available to him when he arrives to conduct the MSE. It is his role to determine the patient's treatment plan, whether to consult another medical service, or whether to notify the patient's Obstetrician. It is his role to determine the patient's disposition from the ED, including whether or not the patient needs to be transferred to another hospital for a higher level of care. On 01/11/16, MD/E was not notified by the ED RN that P1 had presented to the ED for evaluation of an EMC. As a result, P1 did not receive a MSE to evaluate her obstetric EMC.  

MD/D was interviewed on 01/20/16 at 8:00 a.m. MD/D stated that the hospital's policy is for ED nurses to notify the medical provider on-call whenever any patient presents to the ED for emergency care. Although the hospital does not have Obstetric services, the ED still evaluates any woman who presents to the ED with an obstetric problem. If a pregnant woman is bleeding, the ED RN should immediately notify the on-call medical provider. It is never appropriate for ED nurses to notify a medical provider who is not on staff at the hospital or who is not the designated on-call medical provider. One of the medical provider's roles is to determine whether the patient's condition necessitates consultation by any other medical services, including the patient's primary medical provider or Obstetrician. On 01/11/16 when P1 presented with bleeding during pregnancy, the ED RN failed to make decisions that were in the best interest of P1. P1's EMC wasn't evaluated by a medical provider on 01/11/16 because the ED RN failed to notify the hospital's on-call medical provider that P1 had presented to the ED with an obstetric EMC. 

RN/J from Recipient Hospital #2 was interviewed on 01/15/16 at 1:00 p.m. RN/J stated that P1 came to Hospital #2's ED, by private car, on 01/11/16 at 7:50 a.m. P1 said she had just been at the ED at SCBH, who directed her to seek evaluation of her obstetric emergency at Hospital #2. P1 had no paperwork from SCBH nor was Hospital #2 called by SCBH about P1's transfer. On arrival, P1 was emotionally distressed as P1 was having labor contractions. P1 was examined by a physician. P1 was dilated to 4 cm. P1 had a bulging bag of water and was bleeding. The physician determined that P1 was in active labor and required a higher level of care than what Hospital #2 could provide, as Hospital #2 does not have a NICU and does not perform deliveries before 36 weeks gestation. At 8:30 a.m. on 01/11/16, P1 was transferred by ambulance from Hospital #2 to Hospital #3, which is 60 miles away.   

Hospital #2's medical record, dated 01/11/16, indicated that P1 arrived in the ED (time not indicated) with complaints of vaginal bleeding and period-like cramps. P1 said she went to SCBH to be checked and was directed to go to Hospital #2, where her Obstetrician is on staff. P1 was examined by the ED physician. Speculum examination revealed that P1 was dilated to 4 cm and had bulging membranes. P1 was having labor contractions about every 6 minutes. P1 was in active labor and needed a higher level of care for preterm labor. The ED physician contacted Hospital #3, who accepted P1 in transfer. Terbutaline and Betamethasone were administered prior to P1's transfer to Hospital #3 at 8:38 a.m., by ambulance. The ED physician and ED nurse accompanied P1 in the ambulance enroute to Hospital #3.    

Recipient Hospital #3's medical record, dated 01/11/16, indicated that on arrival to Hospital #3, P1 was in active labor with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain radiating to her back. P1 was dilated to 4 cm. and had a bulging bag of water. P1 was admitted     to Labor and Delivery for antepartum care. The antepartum progress notes, dated 01/11/16 - 01/13/16, indicated that P1 continued to have irregular contractions and medications given to arrest preterm labor were not successful. The obstetric progress notes, dated 01/13/16, indicated that P1's membranes ruptured and the fetus flipped to a breech position. The obstetric procedural notes, dated 01/13/16 at 4:34 p.m., indicated that P1 underwent a C-section for preterm labor. P1's baby weighed 3 pounds, 15 ounces and was  transferred to the NICU for care. The hospital discharge summary indicated that P1 had no post-operative complications and was discharged on [DATE].          
SCBH's  EMTALA policy, dated 12/05/11, indicated ""any person who comes to Swift County Benson Hospital (SCBH) requesting assistance for a medical condition/emergency services will receive a medical screening by a qualified provider to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists...a qualified provider to perform a medical screen at SCBH includes a Doctor of Medicine or Osteopathy or a Certified Nurse Practitioner...the medical screen consists of an assessment and any ancillary tests or focused assessment based on the patient's chief complaint necessary to determine the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition...the medical screening examination is the process of determining, with reasonable clinical confidence, whether or not an emergency medical condition exists or a woman is in labor...a woman is in true labor unless a physician  or qualified medical personnel certifies that, after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor.""    

The hospital's policy Admission to the ED, dated June 2010, indicated ""all patients entering the Swift County Benson Hospital ED will have T/P/R/BP/O2 Sats...Patient's assessment will initially be done by the ED RN...RN will inform on call Dr of patient status and information.""  

The hospital's policy for Evaluation of OB Patients in ER, dated 12/05/11, indicated ""a patient presenting to the ER  with suspected or known labor must receive a medical screening examination (MSE). A minimal MSE/OB triage assessment includes the following: maternal vital signs, fetal heart tones, uterine contractions...for pregnant patients in labor, the purpose of the MSE is to determine whether there is sufficient time to transfer the patient before delivery, or whether the transfer would pose a threat to the patient or her baby. A physician must make this determination...serious conditions in pregnant women to be considered are:...placenta previa with painless vaginal bleeding.""

Based on observation, interview, and document review, the hospital failed to provide a medical screening examination (MSE) for 1 of 6 patients (P1), who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation of an obstetric emergency medical condition (EMC).

Findings include:

Observations of the hospital's ED on 01/19/16 at 9:50 a.m. established that the ED is comprised of three patient exam rooms with one bed each and a trauma bay with two beds. Exam room #3 is set up for patients who present with obstetric problems. Exam room #3 has obstetric examination supplies, a Doptone, neonatal emergency supplies, and an infant warmer. One RN was present in the ED at the time it was toured. 
RN/B was interviewed on 01/19/16 at 10:00 a.m. RN/B stated that the ED is staffed 24/7 with one RN. A mid-level provider is onsite in the ED, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After 5:00 p.m. weekdays, weekends, or holidays, the ED is staffed by on-call medical providers. A weekend is defined as beginning at 5:00 p.m. on Friday and extending through 8:00 a.m. on Monday. During weekends, the medical provider on-call is located onsite in an apartment that is attached to the hospital. The hospital does not have an Obstetric Department.P1 was interviewed on 01/25/16 at 12:54 p.m. P1 stated she woke up on 01/11/16 around 6:50 a.m. and had a considerable amount of vaginal bleeding. P1 also had a low backache. P1 was scared because she knew these were abnormal signs for a 30-week pregnancy. P1 took a picture of the bleeding and went to the nearest hospital, which was Swift County Benson Hospital (SCBH). P1 arrived at the SCBH ED around 7:00 a.m. A nurse greeted P1 at the ED door and had P1 sit in a chair in an exam room. The nurse offered to call P1's Obstetrician about P1's bleeding. The Nurse didn't examine P1 or look at the picture P1 had taken of the bleeding. The nurse left P1 in the exam room alone for about 5 minutes and then came back and told P1 to go to Hospital #2, which is where P1 had pre-planned to deliver her baby per her primary Obstetrician. P1 left the ED at SCBH and drove herself to Hospital #2, which is about a half hour away from SCBH. When P1 got to Hospital #2, a physician examined her. P1 was dilated to 4 or 5 cm and was in active labor. The physician at Hospital #2 told P1 she needed to go to Hospital #3 where there is a NICU for premature infants. Hospital #2 then sent P1 by ambulance to Hospital #3, which is over an hour from Hospital #2. When P1 got to Hospital #3, P1 was immediately admitted     to the inpatient Obstetric Department. P1 received medication for two days in attempt to stop the premature labor. On the second day at Hospital #3, P1's water broke and the baby flipped to a breech position. P1 had a C-section on 01/13/16. P1's baby was born at 31 weeks and weighed 3 pounds, 15 ounces. P1's baby was taken to the NICU. P1 was discharged    from Hospital #3 on 01/15/16. P1's baby remains in the NICU at Hospital #3 on ventilatory support.    

RN/F was interviewed on 01/20/16 at 9:00 a.m. RN/F stated she is an experienced ED nurse and worked the night shift of 01/10/16 - 01/11/16 from 7:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. During RN/F's 12-hour shift on 01/10/16 - 01/11/16, two patients presented to the ED seeking care for an EMC, P20 and P1. P20 presented at 6:30 a.m. with complaints of flank pain. RN/F escorted P20 to Exam Room #2, assessed P20, and notified the on-call medical provider of P20's arrival and need for a MSE. The on-call medical provider, MD/E, was onsite at the hospital and conducted P20's MSE about ten minutes later. MD/E then left the ED while results from P20's labs and U/A were pending. P1 then presented to the ED around 7:00 a.m. with complaints of vaginal bleeding. P1 was 30 weeks pregnant. P1 denied pain but was concerned about the bleeding. RN/F escorted P1 to Exam room #1. RN/F did not know why she did not room P1 in Exam room #3 which is set up for obstetric patients. RN/F did not assess P1. RN/F did not obtain P1's vital signs, check the amount or color of P1's vaginal bleeding, palpate P1's abdomen for possible uterine contractions, or check fetal heart tones. RN/F did not notify MD/E of P1's arrival and need for a MSE. Rather, RN/F asked P1 if P1 had notified her Obstetrician of the present problem with vaginal bleeding. P1 had not contacted her Obstetrician so RN/F offered to contact P1's Obstetrician, who was not the medical provider on-call and is not a medical provider on staff at the hospital. P1's Obstetrician is a medical provider on staff at Hospital #2. P1's Obstetrician directed RN/F to send P1 to Hospital #2 for evaluation. P1 left the hospital and went to Hospital #2, by private vehicle. Hospital #2 is approximately 32 miles away. After P1 left the hospital, RN/F went to the nurse's desk to check on the status of P20's labs. A nurse (unidentified) from Hospital #2 called and asked many questions about the condition and transfer status of P1, as Hospital #2 had been alerted by P1's Obstetrician that P1 was on her way there with an obstetric problem. It was then that RN/F realized she her error regarding the care of P1 and P1's unborn fetus. RN/F did not know why she failed to assess P1 or notify the on-call medical provider of P1's need for an obstetric MSE.  RN/F's normal practice is to thoroughly assess a patient based on the patient's presenting symptoms. RN/F's normal practice is to notify the medical provider on-call of all patients presenting to the ED with EMCs.  

MD/E was interviewed on 01/20/16 at 9:30 a.m. MD/E stated he was located onsite at the hospital from 5:00 p.m. on 01/08/16 to 8:00 a.m. on 01/11/16 as he was the medical provider on-call.

Based on review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Policies, and Rules and Regulations, facility policies, Medical Screening Examination (MSE) checklist, ED central log, medical records, employee files, Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)  and MSE training and test, staff interviews, and Memo from ED Nursing Director,  the facility failed to provide an appropriate MSE that was within the capability of the hospital's emergency department including ancillary services routinely available to the ED to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for ten (10) patients (#s 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24) of twenty-nine (29) sampled patients.  


Findings:

Review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Policies, and Rules and Regulations, Revised August 6, 2014 by the Medical Executive Committee, and Approved August 11, 2014 by the Board of Directors, part 5.A. The Emergency Department, 6.  A medical screening examination is required by federal law and regulation to be provided to any person who comes to the Hospital's ED or Labor and Delivery Department and requests examination or treatment.  A medical screening examination may be provided in the ED by the following individuals:
A.  A practitioner with appropriate clinical privileges;
B.  An emergency triage nurse employed by the Hospital; or
C.  A nurse practitioner or physician's assistant or by the emergency department physicians.

Review of facility policy PRB-6463, Emergency Medical Treatment, Stabilization and Transfer Policy, effective 02/03/2014, revealed:
II.  Policy
A.  Any individual who comes to the hospital (anywhere on the premises, including the parking lot, sidewalk and driveway) and requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, shall be provided an appropriate medical screening examination within the facility's capabilities to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.
B.  If it is determined that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the appropriate medical personnel shall provide such further examination and treatment as may be required to stabilize the condition, or transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with these policies. If the patient is stabilized or no medical emergency exists, the patient may be treated, transferred or discharged   .
Definition(s):
A.  Medical Screening Evaluation:  A clinical evaluation performed by a physician or a mid-level provider (i.e., Physician's Assistant, Certified Nurse Practitioner, Certified Midwife), a registered nurse (RN) with training and experience in a specialized area (i.e., emergency department, labor and delivery, psychiatry), or a mastered prepared mental health professional (i.e., LCSW [Licensed Clinical Social Worker], LPC [Licensed Professional Counselor], MSW [Masters of Social Work], etc.) working under the supervision and direction of a physician, to determine if an emergency condition exists. The screening shall be within the capabilities of the hospital, including routinely available ancillary services.

Review of facility policy ED-124, Emergency Department Triage, effective 06/03/2014, revealed the emergency registered nurse triages each health care consumer utilizing age, developmentally appropriate, and culturally sensitive practices to prioritize and optimize health care consumer flow, expediting those health care consumers who require immediate care.
ll. Rationale:
Triage is the process of prioritizing incoming/arriving patients within the Emergency Department. The goal is to rapidly gather ""sufficient"" information to determine triage acuity.
lll. Related Educational Competency/Requirements:
A. Triage would be conducted by a trained, ED experienced registered nurse using subjective and objective data while providing physical, emotional and psychosocial support to the health care consumer, family and others as appropriate.
B. Documents relevant data and triage acuity for every health care consumer in a retrievable form.
C.  Implements appropriate interventions according to established organizational policies/protocols, as warranted by the health care consumer's status.
V. Procedure:
B. The patient is assigned a level using the ESI (Emergency Severity Index), 5 level system, to determine priority of care. Level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent).
C.  The triage nurse will then complete a more in depth initial assessment including both subjective symptoms and objective signs, in addition to a screening history.  
D. Once complete, the ED RN will update the ESI triage level. Level 3-5 patients will be seen according to their level of priority and time of arrival when a room is available.

Review of the facility's Emergency Department Triage Addendum 1, Five Level Triage, updated, revealed:
Level 4:  Patients in this category were non-urgent, require a less in depth evaluation, and are stable. These patients may require one resource as predicted by the triage nurse.  Examples: Migraine headache with history of migraines, sore throat/fever without respiratory compromise, low back pain with urinary symptoms, ankle pain after fall without chest pain or fainting, laceration with simple repair.
Level 5:  Patients in this category were non-urgent patients, require a less in- depth evaluation, and are stable. These patients do not require any resources as predicted by the triage nurse.  Examples:  Back to work note, prescription refill, mild low back pain without urinary symptoms, and earache with or without fever greater than 3 months of age.

Review of facility policy ED-162, Medical Screening Exams ESI Level 4 & 5 Patients in the Emergency Department, effective 12/02/2014, revealed:
II.  Rational
B.  Utilizing Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage scoring criterion, low acuity patients (Levels 4 & 5) are not considered high risk or a medical emergency.
III.  Related Educational/Competency Requirements
A. Medical screening exam (MSE) was to be completed by the triage nurse on the ESI level 4 and 5 patients. The triage nurse is a registered nurse who has at least (6) months of ED nursing care experience. 
B. The registered nurse was to complete a triage competency prior to working independently at triage.
C. The RN would also complete annual education and competency verification on the medical screening of ESI level 4 and 5 patients.
V. Clinical Policy
A.  Medical screening is done on all ED patients to determine if an emergency medical condition is present.
VI.  Procedure
A.  Once the patient is identified as a level 4 or 5 by the triage nurse, the nurse will complete the MSE checklist.
B.  Once the checklist is completed,
1.  If the answers are all ""No"" then the nurse will check the ""Patient is stable and appropriate for referral box"".
2.  If there is ""Yes"" circled, then the RN will check the box, ""Referred to provider for MSE"".
C.  If the patient is referred to the provider for MSE, the chart will be evaluated by the provider.
D.  If the patient is stable and appropriate for financial referral, the patient location would be changed on the electronic tracker board to WRFC (waiting room to financial counselor). The financial counselor would complete their financial screening process.
E. If the patient is unable to meet the financial requirements and chooses not to remain, the patient would be given a list of referrals in the community in which to access care.  The tracker board disposition will be entered by the financial counselor as ""referred out"" and the chart taken to the ED for processing.  

Review of the hospital's Medical Screening Exam Checklist (formally ED-162-a), dated 05/23/2007, revealed the following screening questions which were to be answered yes or no:
1. Is the Chief Complaint reflective of high acuity, high risk or a true emergency?                                              
2. Are any vital signs abnormal?               	 				               
3. Are any mental status changes present?   		
4. Are any abnormalities in the general appearance present that would suggest the presence of an emergency medical condition?    						     
5. Is the patient unable to walk?	                                                             
6. Does a focused physical exam reveal abnormalities that would be considered an emergency?                                                                                                            
7. Does the patient complain of severe pain (greater than 7/10) and/or the presence of clinical signs suggestive of acute pain or distress?                    				     
8. Do any possible pitfalls apply to the patient?     				          
9. Is the patient <10 or >[AGE] years old?                                                                                          
** If a ""yes"" is answered to any of the above questions, the patient will need further medical screening by a physician.
__ Patient is stable and appropriate for referral.
__ Referred to provider for MSE.
RN Signature and Time.

Review of facility policy entitled Point of Service Collections, revised November 2012, revealed:
I.  Patients receiving services throughout the hospital would be advised of up-front payment responsibilities and money would be collected at the time of service according to protocol.
II. Implementation
A.  Insurance information would be secured at that point of pre-registration/registration and benefits would be verified either on-line or via telephone. 
B.  Point-of-service payment responsibilities would be determined by pre-registration/ registration/ancillary staff, including deposits, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance amounts.
C.  Payment responsibilities will be communicated to patients/family members and money will be collected and posted at the time of service according to cash collection policies/procedures.  
IV.  Procedure:
A. Pre-Registration
1. Insured patients were to be advised of all deductibles, co-payments, and/or co-insurance that would be due at the time of service or collected at Pre-Registration.
2. Private pay patients would be advised of scheduled test/procedure costs advised that payment was expected in full at the time of service.
3. Patients indicating an inability to pay would be referred to a financial counselor on a case-by-case basis to discuss payment arrangements.
C. Emergency Department Patients
1. Patients presenting for emergency services would receive a quick-registration at the onset of their visit, without any financial information gathered or assessed prior to a medical screening.
2. After the medical screening, patients would either be registered at bedside or in the hub (depending upon acuity) and at that point, insurance information and payment obligations would be discussed.
4. Point of service collection scripts would be used to communicate payment expectations to patients, and payments would be collected via cash, check, or credit/debit cards.
5. Private pay patients that were unable to meet their financial obligations at the time of service would be routed to a financial counselor for arrangements.
7. All private pay patients would be notified of current deposit requirements for 	emergency services. Patients that were classified as ""non-urgent"" would be provided with alternative healthcare treatment options whenever deposit requirements could not be met.

During an interview on 09/14/2015 at 11:10 a.m., the Vice President of Administration stated the ED triage RN(s) had been doing the MSE on level four (4) and five (5) category patients up until last week.  He/she stated a memo had been sent out to the ED nurses.  

Review of the memo that was sent from the ED Nursing Director to the ED nurses on 09/09/2015 at 10:30 a.m. in the conference room, revealed effective 09/09/2015, the triage RN MSE process was to be placed on hold.  The memo informed staff that the issue of referring level four (4) and five (5) patients to the financial counselor from triage was being reviewed and that financial counseling would only be performed after the MSE was completed by the physician or mid-level provider.  

During an interview (#1) with the ED Nursing Director on 09/15/2015 at 2:45 p.m. in the conference room, the Director stated he/she had been in the position for five (5) months and had previously been the ED Nurse Manager for five (5) years.  The Director explained that the ED triage classes are taught by the ED educators and that they also teach the EMTALA and MSE course.  The Director explained that the EMTALA and MSE is a computer based learning tool.  He/she stated, once the course is completed the triage RN(s) have to pass a test, once they pass the test an asterisk is place by the RN(s) name on the schedule to signify that they can work triage and do the MSE on level four (4) and five (5) patients.  The Director confirmed that the RN(s) do not have to do any hands on training or competency testing to do the MSE and that in the past, the facility considered the MSE questionnaire to be the MSE.  The Director stated that once the triage nurse refers the patient out, the patient is then sent to the financial counselor to obtain the patient's insurance information or if private pay, to set up some form of payment plan.  The Director stated one (1) of the ED nurses (#7) had referred out most of the patient's that had been referred out.  The Director stated the nurse (#7) had coded the patients incorrectly.  

During an interview with ED RN (#6) on 09/16/15 at 9:40 a.m. in the conference room, the nurse stated he/she had worked in the facility for 10 years, and that most of that time had been in the ED.  The nurse stated he/she had been a Clinical Coordinator for 3 1/2 years.  He/she said the RN(s) were no longer doing MSE(s).  The nurse confirmed that previously RN(s) could do the MSE on levels four (4) and five (5).  The nurse stated the educators had taught the RN(s) how to use the MSE questionnaire, and that if the nurses had any concerns when doing a MSE, the patient could be seen by the provider.  The nurse said the facility had been having the RN(s) do MSE for about four (4) to five (5) years.  

During a telephone interview with the ED Medical Director on 09/16/15 at 2:00 p.m., the physician explained he/she had been the ED Medical Director for seven (7) to (8) years.  The physician stated he/she was aware the RN(s) were using the MSE questionnaire to do the MSE on level four (4) and level (5) patients.  The physician said he/she was under the impression that the nurses were determining whether an emergency medical condition existed prior to referring a patient out.  The physician stated he/she agreed that if the MSE documentation was missing then he/she could not say that a MSE was performed.  He/she stated a MSE on levels four (4) and five (5) should have a focused history and physical examination.

During an interview on 09/16/15 at 2:30 p.m. in the conference room, the Clinical Coordinator (#7) stated he/she had worked in the ED since March 2013.  He/she explained that the Clinical Coordinators' role was to function as the Charge Nurse and that they sometimes had to work in triage and do MSEs.  The nurse confirmed that computer based learning courses had been provided for RN(s) who worked triage and did the MSE(s).  The nurse explained that a MSE was a head to toe once over of the patient to see if the patient could walk and talk and whether the patient was coherent.  The nurse explained he/she had been performing the referred outs wrong because he/she had misunderstood and had coded patients wrong.   


The facility failed to ensure  that appropriate medical screening examinations were provided for patients that were within the capability of the hospital ' s emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for patient #14, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #21,  #22, #23, and #24. The facility also failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided for patient #14, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #21,  #22, #23, and     #24 by Qualified Medical Personnel.

Based on review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Policies, and Rules and Regulations, facility policies, Medical Screening Examination (MSE) checklist, ED central log, medical records, employee files, Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)  and MSE training and test, staff interviews, and Memo from ED Nursing Director,  the facility failed to provide an appropriate MSE that was within the capability of the hospital's emergency department including ancillary services routinely available to the ED to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for ten (10) patients (#s 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24) of twenty-nine (29) sampled patients.  


Findings:

Review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Policies, and Rules and Regulations, Revised August 6, 2014 by the Medical Executive Committee, and Approved August 11, 2014 by the Board of Directors, part 5.A. The Emergency Department, 6.  A medical screening examination is required by federal law and regulation to be provided to any person who comes to the Hospital's ED or Labor and Delivery Department and requests examination or treatment.  A medical screening examination may be provided in the ED by the following individuals:
A.  A practitioner with appropriate clinical privileges;
B.  An emergency triage nurse employed by the Hospital; or
C.  A nurse practitioner or physician's assistant or by the emergency department physicians.

Review of facility policy PRB-6463, Emergency Medical Treatment, Stabilization and Transfer Policy, effective 02/03/2014, revealed:
II.  Policy
A.  Any individual who comes to the hospital (anywhere on the premises, including the parking lot, sidewalk and driveway) and requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, shall be provided an appropriate medical screening examination within the facility's capabilities to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.
B.  If it is determined that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the appropriate medical personnel shall provide such further examination and treatment as may be required to stabilize the condition, or transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with these policies. If the patient is stabilized or no medical emergency exists, the patient may be treated, transferred or discharged   .
Definition(s):
A.  Medical Screening Evaluation:  A clinical evaluation performed by a physician or a mid-level provider (i.e., Physician's Assistant, Certified Nurse Practitioner, Certified Midwife), a registered nurse (RN) with training and experience in a specialized area (i.e., emergency department, labor and delivery, psychiatry), or a mastered prepared mental health professional (i.e., LCSW [Licensed Clinical Social Worker], LPC [Licensed Professional Counselor], MSW [Masters of Social Work], etc.) working under the supervision and direction of a physician, to determine if an emergency condition exists. The screening shall be within the capabilities of the hospital, including routinely available ancillary services.

Review of facility policy ED-124, Emergency Department Triage, effective 06/03/2014, revealed the emergency registered nurse triages each health care consumer utilizing age, developmentally appropriate, and culturally sensitive practices to prioritize and optimize health care consumer flow, expediting those health care consumers who require immediate care.
ll. Rationale:
Triage is the process of prioritizing incoming/arriving patients within the Emergency Department. The goal is to rapidly gather ""sufficient"" information to determine triage acuity.
lll. Related Educational Competency/Requirements:
A. Triage would be conducted by a trained, ED experienced registered nurse using subjective and objective data while providing physical, emotional and psychosocial support to the health care consumer, family and others as appropriate.
B. Documents relevant data and triage acuity for every health care consumer in a retrievable form.
C.  Implements appropriate interventions according to established organizational policies/protocols, as warranted by the health care consumer's status.
V. Procedure:
B. The patient is assigned a level using the ESI (Emergency Severity Index), 5 level system, to determine priority of care. Level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent).
C.  The triage nurse will then complete a more in depth initial assessment including both subjective symptoms and objective signs, in addition to a screening history.  
D. Once complete, the ED RN will update the ESI triage level. Level 3-5 patients will be seen according to their level of priority and time of arrival when a room is available.

Review of the facility's Emergency Department Triage Addendum 1, Five Level Triage, updated, revealed:
Level 4:  Patients in this category were non-urgent, require a less in depth evaluation, and are stable. These patients may require one resource as predicted by the triage nurse.  Examples: Migraine headache with history of migraines, sore throat/fever without respiratory compromise, low back pain with urinary symptoms, ankle pain after fall without chest pain or fainting, laceration with simple repair.
Level 5:  Patients in this category were non-urgent patients, require a less in- depth evaluation, and are stable. These patients do not require any resources as predicted by the triage nurse.  Examples:  Back to work note, prescription refill, mild low back pain without urinary symptoms, and earache with or without fever greater than 3 months of age.

Review of facility policy ED-162, Medical Screening Exams ESI Level 4 & 5 Patients in the Emergency Department, effective 12/02/2014, revealed:
II.  Rational
B.  Utilizing Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage scoring criterion, low acuity patients (Levels 4 & 5) are not considered high risk or a medical emergency.
III.  Related Educational/Competency Requirements
A. Medical screening exam (MSE) was to be completed by the triage nurse on the ESI level 4 and 5 patients. The triage nurse is a registered nurse who has at least (6) months of ED nursing care experience. 
B. The registered nurse was to complete a triage competency prior to working independently at triage.
C. The RN would also complete annual education and competency verification on the medical screening of ESI level 4 and 5 patients.
V. Clinical Policy
A.  Medical screening is done on all ED patients to determine if an emergency medical condition is present.
VI.  Procedure
A.  Once the patient is identified as a level 4 or 5 by the triage nurse, the nurse will complete the MSE checklist.
B.  Once the checklist is completed,
1.  If the answers are all ""No"" then the nurse will check the ""Patient is stable and appropriate for referral box"".
2.  If there is ""Yes"" circled, then the RN will check the box, ""Referred to provider for MSE"".
C.  If the patient is referred to the provider for MSE, the chart will be evaluated by the provider.
D.  If the patient is stable and appropriate for financial referral, the patient location would be changed on the electronic tracker board to WRFC (waiting room to financial counselor). The financial counselor would complete their financial screening process.
E. If the patient is unable to meet the financial requirements and chooses not to remain, the patient would be given a list of referrals in the community in which to access care.  The tracker board disposition will be entered by the financial counselor as ""referred out"" and the chart taken to the ED for processing.  

Review of the hospital's Medical Screening Exam Checklist (formally ED-162-a), dated 05/23/2007, revealed the following screening questions which were to be answered yes or no:
1. Is the Chief Complaint reflective of high acuity, high risk or a true emergency?                                              
2. Are any vital signs abnormal?               	 				               
3. Are any mental status changes present?   		
4. Are any abnormalities in the general appearance present that would suggest the presence of an emergency medical condition?    						     
5. Is the patient unable to walk?	                                                             
6. Does a focused physical exam reveal abnormalities that would be considered an emergency?                                                                                                            
7. Does the patient complain of severe pain (greater than 7/10) and/or the presence of clinical signs suggestive of acute pain or distress?                    				     
8. Do any possible pitfalls apply to the patient?     				          
9. Is the patient <10 or >[AGE] years old?                                                                                          
** If a ""yes"" is answered to any of the above questions, the patient will need further medical screening by a physician.
__ Patient is stable and appropriate for referral.
__ Referred to provider for MSE.

Review of facility policy entitled Point of Service Collections, revised November 2012, revealed:
I.  Patients receiving services throughout the hospital would be advised of up-front payment responsibilities and money would be collected at the time of service according to protocol.
II. Implementation
A.  Insurance information would be secured at that point of pre-registration/registration and benefits would be verified either on-line or via telephone. 
B.  Point-of-service payment responsibilities would be determined by pre-registration/ registration/ancillary staff, including deposits, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance amounts.
C.  Payment responsibilities will be communicated to patients/family members and money will be collected and posted at the time of service according to cash collection policies/procedures.  
IV.  Procedure:
A. Pre-Registration
1. Insured patients were to be advised of all deductibles, co-payments, and/or co-insurance that would be due at the time of service or collected at Pre-Registration.
2. Private pay patients would be advised of scheduled test/procedure costs advised that payment was expected in full at the time of service.
3. Patients indicating an inability to pay would be referred to a financial counselor on a case-by-case basis to discuss payment arrangements.
C. Emergency Department Patients
1. Patients presenting for emergency services would receive a quick-registration at the onset of their visit, without any financial information gathered or assessed prior to a medical screening.
2. After the medical screening, patients would either be registered at bedside or in the hub (depending upon acuity) and at that point, insurance information and payment obligations would be discussed.
4. Point of service collection scripts would be used to communicate payment expectations to patients, and payments would be collected via cash, check, or credit/debit cards.
5. Private pay patients that were unable to meet their financial obligations at the time of service would be routed to a financial counselor for arrangements.
7. All private pay patients would be notified of current deposit requirements for 	emergency services. Patients that were classified as ""non-urgent"" would be provided with alternative healthcare treatment options whenever deposit requirements could not be met.

During an interview on 09/14/2015 at 11:10 a.m., the Vice President of Administration stated the ED triage RN(s) had been doing the MSE on level four (4) and five (5) category patients up until last week.  He/she stated a memo had been sent out to the ED nurses.  

Review of the memo that was sent from the ED Nursing Director to the ED nurses on 09/09/2015 at 10:30 a.m. in the conference room, revealed effective 09/09/2015, the triage RN MSE process was to be placed on hold.  The memo informed staff that the issue of referring level four (4) and five (5) patients to the financial counselor from triage was being reviewed and that financial counseling would only be performed after the MSE was completed by the physician or mid-level provider.  

During an interview (#1) with the ED Nursing Director on 09/15/2015 at 2:45 p.m. in the conference room, the Director stated he/she had been in the position for five (5) months and had previously been the ED Nurse Manager for five (5) years.  The Director explained that the ED triage classes are taught by the ED educators and that they also teach the EMTALA and MSE course.  The Director explained that the EMTALA and MSE is a computer based learning tool.  He/she stated, once the course is completed the triage RN(s) have to pass a test, once they pass the test an asterisk is place by the RN(s) name on the schedule to signify that they can work triage and do the MSE on level four (4) and five (5) patients.  The Director confirmed that the RN(s) do not have to do any hands on training or competency testing to do the MSE and that in the past, the facility considered the MSE questionnaire to be the MSE.  The Director stated that once the triage nurse refers the patient out, the patient is then sent to the financial counselor to obtain the patient's insurance information or if private pay, to set up some form of payment plan.  The Director stated one (1) of the ED nurses (#7) had referred out most of the patient's that had been referred out.  The Director stated the nurse (#7) had coded the patients incorrectly.  

During an interview with ED RN (#6) on 09/16/15 at 9:40 a.m. in the conference room, the nurse stated he/she had worked in the facility for 10 years, and that most of that time had been in the ED.  The nurse stated he/she had been a Clinical Coordinator for 3 1/2 years.  He/she said the RN(s) were no longer doing MSE(s).  The nurse confirmed that previously RN(s) could do the MSE on levels four (4) and five (5).  The nurse stated the educators had taught the RN(s) how to use the MSE questionnaire, and that if the nurses had any concerns when doing a MSE, the patient could be seen by the provider.  The nurse said the facility had been having the RN(s) do MSE for about four (4) to five (5) years.  

During a telephone interview with the ED Medical Director on 09/16/15 at 2:00 p.m., the physician explained he/she had been the ED Medical Director for seven (7) to (8) years.  The physician stated he/she was aware the RN(s) were using the MSE questionnaire to do the MSE on level four (4) and level (5) patients.  The physician said he/she was under the impression that the nurses were determining whether an emergency medical condition existed prior to referring a patient out.  The physician stated he/she agreed that if the MSE documentation was missing then he/she could not say that a MSE was performed.  He/she stated a MSE on levels four (4) and five (5) should have a focused history and physical examination.

During an interview on 09/16/15 at 2:30 p.m. in the conference room, the Clinical Coordinator (#7) stated he/she had worked in the ED since March 2013.  He/she explained that the Clinical Coordinators' role was to function as the Charge Nurse and that they sometimes had to work in triage and do MSEs.  The nurse confirmed that computer based learning courses had been provided for RN(s) who worked triage and did the MSE(s).  The nurse explained that a MSE was a head to toe once over of the patient to see if the patient could walk and talk and whether the patient was coherent.  The nurse explained he/she had been performing the referred outs wrong because he/she had misunderstood and had coded patients wrong.   


The facility failed to ensure  that appropriate medical screening examinations were provided for patients that were within the capability of the hospital ' s emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for patient #14, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #21,  #22, #23, and #24. The facility also failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided for patient #14, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #21,  #22, #23, and     #24 by Qualified Medical Personnel.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to appropriately transfer one of twenty two sampled patients, Patient 1, to another hospital when:
1. Physician certification form for the transfer was not completed.
2. Patient 1, while in labor, was transferred via personal car.
This deficient practice resulted in a potential risk for harm to Patient 1 and to her infant who was delivered in transit.


Findings:


During a review of the electronic medical record on 9/8/16 at 11:50 AM, a Quality Management staff (QM), acknowledged Patient 1 arrived to the Emergency Department (ED) on 8/24/16 at 3:51 AM. Review of the ""Triage"" note entered at 3:57 AM indicated ""...presents to the ED with lower abdominal cramping. 24 weeks pregnant...EDD (estimated delivery date) 12/11/16. Pain intermittent since 12 midnight. 1 episode of vaginal discharge with some bleeding noted. Cramping at triage for 10 minutes.""
At 4:18 AM ""Nurses Notes: Patient examined by physician..."".
At 5:38 AM an ED physician (MD 1) entered ""History of Present Illness...approximately 25 weeks pregnant..."".
At 5:42 AM MD 1 wrote ""Doctor Notes...based on the physical exam and history, concern is high for labor cramps,...patient will require fetal monitoring...Spoke with Dr...at [GACH 3] L and D (labor and delivery) who agrees with transfer. Patient's boyfriend will drive them by private car..."".
At 4:21 AM MD 1 wrote ""Disposition Type: Discharge...[GACH 3] Labor and Delivery, Disposition Transport: Auto"".


During an interview on 9/8/16 at 12:15 PM, QM stated ""Pregnant patients are followed at our facility. We have an agreement with GACH 3 for Labor and Delivery (L and D). When patients come to the ED and are sent to L and D, they are given a printout of the ED paperwork to take with them, and family may take patients there in their own vehicle. Patients are aware they will deliver their baby at GACH 3...""


QM printed a copy of Patient 1 ED medical record and stated ""This is Patient 1's full ED record...there is not a transfer form..."".  Review of that printed copy did not indicate a discussion with Patient 1 or her husband about the risks and benefits of the transfer to Labor and Delivery via their own car. There was no evidence of consent to the transfer using that vehicle. 


During a phone interview on 9/14/16 at 10:00 AM, MD 1 stated ""Patient 1 was definitively a transfer to [GACH 3] L and D...I was concerned she could be in labor, she could possibly deliver her baby, Patient 1 pregnancy was a high risk...I did not want her delivering early nor to delay her care...I can't explain why a transfer form was not completed...,"". When asked about the option of using an ambulance with qualified personnel to transport Patient 1, MD 1 stated ""I was told by the clerk that it would take 45 minutes to get an ambulance..."".


Record review of a 9/7/16 printed copy of Patient 1's ED electronic record from [GACH 2] indicated  under ""Chief Complaint: ...went into labor on the way here. Baby was out but placenta was not..."". Under ""ED Provider Notes"", a physician entry on 8/24/16 read ""...Primigravida [first pregnancy]...denies problems prenatal...patient was on way to [GACH 3]....child had delivered in car now in parking lot. Patient presents with fetus on her chest. The umbilical cord was clamped and cut. Child quickly handed off to peds/NICU [Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]...Clinical Impressions: Precipitous delivery...Sent to Labor and  Delivery"".


Record review of [GACH 2] 9/2/16 entity reported incident statement to State Agency indicated ""...The patient delivered her child in route to [GACH 3]...Arrived on 8/24/16 at 5:15 AM and her child was not breathing. A code blue was called in the [GACH 2] ED and the patient's [Patient 1's] child expired"".


Record review of a facility's blank form titled ""Patient Referral Form for Transfer"" indicated in section ""Certification- Physician must complete"" and check boxes for ""Patient condition at time of transfer, It is my medical judgment that this transfer will not create a medical hazard for this patient, The reason for transfer have been explained to the patient and the patient understands and agrees,..."". At the bottom of the form there was a ""Patient signature..."" space for ""Patient consent to transfer:  All transfers have inherent risks of delays or accidents in transit, pain or discomfort upon movement, and limited medical capacity of transport units that may limit available care in the event of a crisis.""


Record review of a facility policy most recent review date of ""04/04"" and titled ""Transfer of the Patient in Early Labor"" indicated under ""Policy: The patient who presents to the Emergency Department in labor will be triaged and classified as an emergent patient and immediately evaluated..., 3...the Emergency Department will complete the necessary transfer forms and arrange transportation to [GACH 3] as appropriate...""


Record review of a facility policy most recent review date of ""6/11/2014"" and titled ""Emergency Medical Patient Transfers..."" indicated under ""Purpose...to provide emergency medical services, and that patients requiring transfer to another facility for any reason will be transferred safely and without delay.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to appropriately transfer one of twenty two sampled patients, Patient 1, to another hospital when:
1. Physician certification form for the transfer was not completed.
2. Patient 1, while in labor, was transferred via personal car.
This deficient practice resulted in a potential risk for harm to Patient 1 and to her infant who was delivered in transit.


Findings:


During a review of the electronic medical record on 9/8/16 at 11:50 AM, a Quality Management staff (QM), acknowledged Patient 1 arrived to the Emergency Department (ED) on 8/24/16 at 3:51 AM. Review of the ""Triage"" note entered at 3:57 AM indicated ""...presents to the ED with lower abdominal cramping. 24 weeks pregnant...EDD (estimated delivery date) 12/11/16. Pain intermittent since 12 midnight. 1 episode of vaginal discharge with some bleeding noted. Cramping at triage for 10 minutes.""
At 4:18 AM ""Nurses Notes: Patient examined by physician..."".
At 5:38 AM an ED physician (MD 1) entered ""History of Present Illness...approximately 25 weeks pregnant..."".
At 5:42 AM MD 1 wrote ""Doctor Notes...based on the physical exam and history, concern is high for labor cramps,...patient will require fetal monitoring...Spoke with Dr...at [GACH 3] L and D (labor and delivery) who agrees with transfer. Patient's boyfriend will drive them by private car..."".
At 4:21 AM MD 1 wrote ""Disposition Type: Discharge...[GACH 3] Labor and Delivery, Disposition Transport: Auto"".


During an interview on 9/8/16 at 12:15 PM, QM stated ""Pregnant patients are followed at our facility. We have an agreement with GACH 3 for Labor and Delivery (L and D). When patients come to the ED and are sent to L and D, they are given a printout of the ED paperwork to take with them, and family may take patients there in their own vehicle. Patients are aware they will deliver their baby at GACH 3...""


QM printed a copy of Patient 1 ED medical record and stated ""This is Patient 1's full ED record...there is not a transfer form..."".  Review of that printed copy did not indicate a discussion with Patient 1 or her husband about the risks and benefits of the transfer to Labor and Delivery via their own car. There was no evidence of consent to the transfer using that vehicle. 


During a phone interview on 9/14/16 at 10:00 AM, MD 1 stated ""Patient 1 was definitively a transfer to [GACH 3] L and D...I was concerned she could be in labor, she could possibly deliver her baby, Patient 1 pregnancy was a high risk...I did not want her delivering early nor to delay her care...I can't explain why a transfer form was not completed...,"". When asked about the option of using an ambulance with qualified personnel to transport Patient 1, MD 1 stated ""I was told by the clerk that it would take 45 minutes to get an ambulance..."".


Record review of a 9/7/16 printed copy of Patient 1's ED electronic record from [GACH 2] indicated  under ""Chief Complaint: ...went into labor on the way here. Baby was out but placenta was not..."". Under ""ED Provider Notes"", a physician entry on 8/24/16 read ""...Primigravida [first pregnancy]...denies problems prenatal...patient was on way to [GACH 3]....child had delivered in car now in parking lot. Patient presents with fetus on her chest. The umbilical cord was clamped and cut. Child quickly handed off to peds/NICU [Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]...Clinical Impressions: Precipitous delivery...Sent to Labor and  Delivery"".


Record review of [GACH 2] 9/2/16 entity reported incident statement to State Agency indicated ""...The patient delivered her child in route to [GACH 3]...Arrived on 8/24/16 at 5:15 AM and her child was not breathing. A code blue was called in the [GACH 2] ED and the patient's [Patient 1's] child expired"".


Record review of a facility's blank form titled ""Patient Referral Form for Transfer"" indicated in section ""Certification- Physician must complete"" and check boxes for ""Patient condition at time of transfer, It is my medical judgment that this transfer will not create a medical hazard for this patient, The reason for transfer have been explained to the patient and the patient understands and agrees,..."". At the bottom of the form there was a ""Patient signature..."" space for ""Patient consent to transfer:  All transfers have inherent risks of delays or accidents in transit, pain or discomfort upon movement, and limited medical capacity of transport units that may limit available care in the event of a crisis.""


Record review of a facility policy most recent review date of ""04/04"" and titled ""Transfer of the Patient in Early Labor"" indicated under ""Policy: The patient who presents to the Emergency Department in labor will be triaged and classified as an emergent patient and immediately evaluated..., 3...the Emergency Department will complete the necessary transfer forms and arrange transportation to [GACH 3] as appropriate...""


Record review of a facility policy most recent review date of ""6/11/2014"" and titled ""Emergency Medical Patient Transfers..."" indicated under ""Purpose...to provide emergency medical services, and that patients requiring transfer to another facility for any reason will be transferred safely and without delay. III. Patient transfers involve the following physician and hospital staff responsibilities:...I. All patient transfer documents including...Patient transfer Acknowledgement, Patient Transfer Form...and Physician Certification...IV...C. Transfer of Patients with Unstable Emergency Medical Condition. If the individual is in active labor...the patient may not be transferred unless the following conditions are met: 1. The individual or individual's legal representative...after being fully informed of the risks and possible benefits...signs the Patient Request/Refusal/Consent to transfer under EMTALA... 2. The emergency physician has signed a certification,...""

Based on interview, review of documentation in 6 of 6 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCR to another hospital for services SCR did not have capability to provide at that time (Patients 1, 3, 8, 11, 16, and 17), and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved as the physician certification that the benefits of transfer outweighed the risks of transfer did not reflect that patient specific, individualized risks of transfer had been identified.

Findings include:

1. The hospital policy and procedure titled ""EMTALA Rights and Responsibilities,"" dated ""Effective Date: 06/29/2016"" was reviewed. It reflected ""The purpose of this policy is to describe how St. Charles Health System, Inc. (St. Charles) and its hospitals will comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ... (2) providing necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer to each patient determined to have an EMC ... All caregivers and physicians will be oriented to EMTALA and receive ongoing education.""

""Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) - A medical condition manifested by acute symptoms of sufficient severity ... such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in: Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy ... In addition, a pregnant woman who is having contractions is deemed to have an EMC if: There is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery; or Transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. A physician or qualified medical professional will be responsible for determining if an EMC exists.""

 ""Stabilizing Treatment - Such medical treatment as is necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the patient's EMC is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the patient from a facility. A pregnant woman is considered stabilized with respect to her pregnancy when she has delivered the child and the placenta.""

 ""If, after performing the MSE, a QMP determines that a patient is suffering from an EMC, then St. Charles shall provide stabilizing treatment to the patient ... If a St. Charles facility does not have the capacity fully to stabilize a patient, then it may transfer the patient to another facility with more specialized capabilities. ""

 ""... Each transfer of a patient from a St. Charles facility shall occur only after ... The St. Charles has provided stabilizing treatment within its capacity ...

2. The ED record for Patient 1 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 0611 with a chief complaint of ""anxiety."" The medical record reflected:
* At 0634 the patient was seen by an MD and the patient transferred to SCB BHU via ""private vehicle-[spouse].""
* Although there was no evidence of the patient transfer form required by the hospitals policies and procedures, there was documentation that the receiving hospital, SCB BHU, accepted the patient. However, no documentation that medical records were sent and no documentation to reflect the risks and benefits of transfer had been evaluated and understood by the patient and his/her spouse, or if the patient made it to SCB BHU.
* Further, appropriate transportation with qualified personnel was not used to facilitate the transfer. 

3. The ED record for Patient 3 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1757 with a chief complaint of ""Paranoid/hallucinations."" The medical record reflected the following:
* An MSE was done by an MD who determined the patient needed to be transferred for psychiatric/neuro services that were not available at SCR.
* On 09/14/2018 at 0150 the MD signed the ""patient transfer form"" that included the physician certification of risks and benefits under which the ""benefit"" was documented as ""psych, neuro"" and the ""risks"" were blank. There was no documentation of patient specific risks of transferring the patient.

4. The ED record for Patient 8 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1453 with a chief complaint of ""Suicidal."" The medical record reflected the following:
* The EMC that the individual was experiencing upon presentation to the emergency room    has been stabilized and the patient may now be transferred for psych services that SCR was not able to provide at this time.
*At 2310 the MD signed the ""patient transfer form"" that included the physician certification of risks and benefits under which the ""benefit"" was documented as ""psych"" and the ""risks"" were blank. There was no documentation of patient specific risks of transferring the patient.

5. The ED record for Patient 11 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1320 with a chief complaint of ""abd/chest pain."" The medical record reflected the following:
* The MSE was done by an MD who determined the patient needed to be transferred for cardiology services that were not available at SCR at that time.
* At 1535 the MD signed the ""patient transfer form"" that included the physician certification of risks and benefits under which the ""benefit"" was documented as ""cardiology"" and the ""risks"" were blank. There was no documentation of patient specific risks of transferring the patient.

6. The ED record for Patient 16 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1602 with a chief complaint of ""CP, Suicidal."" The medical record reflected:
* The patient was seen by an MD and a MSE was completed. It was determined the patient needed to be transferred by secure transport for ""psych bed"" as this service was not available at SCR at that time.
* At 2320 the physician signed the ""patient transfer form"" that included the physician certification of risks and benefits under which the ""benefit"" was documented as ""no psych beds here"" and the ""risks"" were ""The individual's condition could worsen during transport and ""The vehicle transporting the individual could be involved in an accident."" There was no documentation of patient specific risks of transferring the patient.

7. The ED record for Patient 17 reflected he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2222 with a chief complaint of ""cough; fever."" The medical record reflected:
* The patient was seen by an MD and a MSE was completed at 2216. It was determined the patient needed to be transferred for inpatient pediatric services that were not available at SCR at that time.

Based on record review and staff interview, the hospital failed to ensure that a patient that arrived to the facility's emergency department received a medical screening examination (MSE), by a qualified health professional for two (2) of 25 sampled patients (Patient 22 and  23). 

This deficient practice had the potential for patients not receiving needed care.

Findings:

1. A review of Patient 22's electronic medical record was conducted with Director of Acute Care Service/ ED Services (DACEDS) on 11/06/19, at 10:38 a.m. The ED Timeline indicated Patient 22 arrived on 10/30/19, at 11:05 AM, with the complaint that Patient 22 had been involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) about two (2) hours ago and was 25 weeks pregnant. At 11:06 AM, Registered Nurse (RN) began the triage and at 11:08 AM, indicated Patient 22 was "" .... here for fetal monitoring,"" and the OB Screening. The ""full triage"" was completed 11:10 AM and Patient 22 was ""sent to Labor & Delivery (L&D) at 11:10 AM accompanied by a nurse."" 

On 11/6/19 at 11:10 AM, the surveyor asked if there was an ""OB Screening,"" and what did the OB screening consisted of. The DACEDS stated, ""The OB screening was basic information use by the triage nurse to ask patient's due date, where she is having contractures, do you have urge to push, did your water brake, is there fetal movement?""  The DACEDS stated, ""No, the MSE in the ED was done and Patient 22 was not seen by the provider.""

2. Patient 23 arrived at the ED on 7/26/19 at 12:02 PM, with the complaint of ""pain in back and stomach"" due to an MVA and was 38 weeks pregnant. The Timeline indicated RN began the triage at 12:08 PM and at 12:16 PM, the OB screening was complete. At 12:17 PM, Patient 23 was sent to L&D. 

During an interview on 11/05/19, at 10:40 AM, the Triage RN stated,""If a pregnant lady walks in and has medical problems, she would be cleared of any medical problems. The RN would communicate to the physician, he/she clears the patient, if stabilized, to go upstairs to L&D. The triage RN notifies the OB RN to come down to escort the patient to L&D.

The DACEDS stated, ""No, the MSE in the ED was done and Patient 22 was not seen by the provider.""

2. Patient 23 arrived at the ED on 7/26/19 at 12:02 PM, with the complaint of ""pain in back and stomach"" due to an MVA and was 38 weeks pregnant. The Timeline indicated RN began the triage at 12:08 PM and at 12:16 PM, the OB screening was complete. At 12:17 PM, Patient 23 was sent to L&D. 

During an interview on 11/05/19, at 10:40 AM, the Triage RN stated,""If a pregnant lady walks in and has medical problems, she would be cleared of any medical problems. The RN would communicate to the physician, he/she clears the patient, if stabilized, to go upstairs to L&D. The triage RN notifies the OB RN to come down to escort the patient to L&D. She further stated, ""all patients 20 weeks or less go upstairs after being cleared but the facility's policy states 24 weeks.

Based on interview, record review, document review, and review of facility policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one (1) of twenty-one (21) patients selected for review and who had presented to the facility extension's Emergency Department (ED) seeking medical care received a medical screening examination (MSE), Patient #1.  A review of documentation in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance transport records revealed Patient #1 arrived at the facility extension ED ambulance bay on 01/12/13 at 7:58 PM and left per ambulance for the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM without disembarking from the ambulance or receiving a MSE because  facility extension ED personnel would not let Patient #1 enter the ED.

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who would investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting"", policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Review of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.

Based on review of facility documents, medical records (MR), and interview with staff (EMP), it was determined that the facility failed to ensure each patient presenting to the Emergency Department was provided with an appropriate medical screening examination by a physician, or other qualified medical personnel, for one of 16 medical records reviewed (MR1).



Findings Include: 

A review of policy entitled ""EMTALA"", revised February 2014, revealed, ""Windber Medical Center will comply with all aspects of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).  Purpose:  To provide a safe environment for all individuals who present to the hospital in an emergency medical condition, regardless of where in the hospital the individual appears.  Procedure:  1.  Any individual who presents to the emergency department, or any other location within the hospital, requesting examination or treatment for a medical condition will be provided with an appropriate medical screening examination within the Emergency Department to determine if he/she is suffering from an emergency medical condition. 2.  An 'emergency medical condition' is defined as a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the mother or her unborn child) in serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.  Ultimately this determination is a medical one.  3.  The person performing the medical screening exam must be a physician or an appropriately credentialed physician assistant. 4.  Following a medical screening exam, if the individual is determined to be suffering from an emergency medical condition, he/she will be provided with appropriate medical treatment until stable or able to be safely transferred to another hospital if applicable.  If the individual does not have an emergency medical condition, the hospital will provide care as appropriate based on the best judgment of the medical screening person. 5.  A pregnant woman who presents in active labor must be treated and kept until delivery is completed (including delivery of the placenta), unless a transfer compliant with EMTALA regulations is appropriate. 6. Regardless of an individual's presenting complaint, an 'appropriate transfer' (i.e. a transfer before complete stabilization) must meet the following criteria:  a. The patient has been treated and stabilized as far as possible within the limits of WMC's capabilities (or the patient is requesting transfer.) b.  The patient needs treatment at a facility capable of providing a higher level of care, and the medical risks of transferring him are outweighed by the medical benefits of the transfer.  C.  The transferring physician certifies the transfer in writing providing an express summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based.  D.

MR1 failed to reveal documented evidence that a medical screening examination had been performed.


3) An interview was conducted with EMP6 who stated that the ""facility has a policy that permits the PA or the nurse to answer the initial Medic Command call.   EMP15 took the Medical Command call as I was not immediately available.  EMS requested Medical Command and I was notified.   There was a very short window, only 30 second ETA. 
The nurse was on the phone to me and said that you need to come over, we have a female, gunshot wound, who's nine months pregnant.  As I'm on the way, I'm thinking, why are they  coming here.  They need to go to the Trauma Center to give the baby the best chance.  They had to pass by our hospital in order to get to the Trauma Center, seven miles away.  It was at that point that we could see the ambulance in the parking lot.  EMP15 and I went out, I felt we needed them to go directly to the Trauma Center.  I asked them why they brought the patient here, and they said, 'The baby needs to come out now.  You're a hospital, right?'
I told them that I could help with the airway.  They said that they didn't have time for that.  I explained that we didn't have anyone here who could take the baby out.  They said that if I was not going to take the baby out, they will go downtown. We are not a Trauma Center, this situation was beyond our capabilities.  They asked I could go along in the ambulance,  I said I can't leave, I am the only physician here.  I asked if they needed help with the airway.  I could see the baby was still moving and mother had facial and neck injuries.  I had to weigh in a quick manner how to handle this.  We don't have OB services here.  We had a General Surgeon and a Gyne, not an OB, on call.  It would take at least 30 minutes at minimum if everyone responded immediately. They could get the patient to the Trauma Center quicker than we could get the baby out.""

No clinical evaluation and not associated charges.  LWOT (left without treatment)-No treatment or assessment by the Physician, but has had a Triage Assessment.  Billing associated with this disposition...Elopement- Patient comes to the ED, triaged, registered, and MSE has been done but leaves unnoticed or without informing staff...AMA [against medical advice]-Patient comes to the ED, triaged, registered, has had and MSE and leaves against the advice of the physician.  AMA form should be completed however, if the patient refuses to sign, documentation to that effect is made on the AMA form and in the physician and nursing notes..."" 

During an interview on 3/14/13 at 3:00 PM when questioned about patients who left without being seen, RN #4 stated if a ""patient brings up AMA, they should come get me and I would explain risks of leaving..."".  RN #4 stated she had been taught if patients wanted to LWBS or LWOT the nurses should ""go to the waiting room and call for them [patients] 2 times"" to make sure they have not gone to the bathroom or to smoke.  RN #4 stated this should be documented in the medical record as ""called patient no response.""

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to provide evidence all reasonable steps were taken to secure a patient's written informed refusal.  The hospital further failed to provide a written description of the examination and treatment including risk and benefits of the examination and treatment for one of 32 sampled patients (1).  Findings:

Patient 1, a [AGE] year old pregnant female, was seen in the Emergency Department (ED) on 6/25/13 with complaints of abdominal pain.

On 7/15/13 at 9:30 a.m. a review of Patient 1's ED record was conducted.  Nursing notes dated 6/25/13 at 1:31 a.m. indicated Patient 1 arrived to the ED and was triaged (prioritizing incoming patients to determine appropriate wait time to be seen by a physician).  Patient 1 was complaining of ""lower abdominal discomfort since 6 p.m., worse over the past hour, 31 weeks pregnant, her doctor is at [Hospital  B]"".  Further review of nursing notes dated 6/25/13 at 1:41 a.m. indicated Patient 1 was seen by Physician A (MD A) in the triage area.  After being seen by MD A, Patient 1 was planning to leave and go to Hospital B ""where she is being treated by her OBGYN (obstetrician gynecologist), patient instructed to follow up with her OBGYN by MD A after discharge from ER  [emergency room   ]"". 

On 7/15/13 at 9:35 a.m. review of MD A's documentation dated 6/25/13 indicated Patient 1 was 33 weeks pregnant and was complaining of abdominal pain.  MD A documented Patient 1 did not have any ""obvious contractions...abdomen was soft...still feel the baby moving at this time"".  Further review of MD A's notes indicated Patient 1 had ""decided that she really did not want to be checked here, wanted be followed up with her physician up at [Hospital B].""  The plan for Patient 1 was that she ""declines being seen here and will pursue her primary care physician or OB physician at [Hospital B]"".    

On 7/15/13 at 9:40 a.m. a complete record review of Patient 1's 6/25/13 ED visit was conducted in the presence of the ED manager.  The record had no indication Patient 1 had signed a refusal of service form.  The record had no indication Patient 1 had been informed of a description of the refused examination and treatment including risk and benefits of the examination and treatment for her current condition (pregnant with complaints of abdominal pain). 

On 7/16/13 at 8 a.m. during an interview with MD A, he explained it was the hospital's policy to have the ED physician called to the triage area when a pregnant female arrived to the ED department.  MD A further explained if the pregnant female was greater than 16 weeks pregnant and presenting with pregnancy related complaints she needed to be further evaluated in the labor and delivery unit.  

On 6/25/13 on Patient 1's arrival to the ED, MD A stated he was called to the triage area to assess Patient 1.  MD A stated Patient 1 and her husband were sitting in the triage area.  He asked Patient 1 if she was having any pain or vaginal bleeding at that time.  Patient 1 stated no but did state she was having possible contractions four to six hours prior.  MD A stated he asked Patient 1 information regarding her primary OBGYN (routine practice to inquire the name of the primary OBGYN).  MD A stated he did not recognize the OBGYN as being a member of the hospital staff.  MD A stated he proceeded with his assessment and informed Patient 1 and her husband that he suspected Patient 1 was in preterm labor and needed to have a ""rapid evaluation"".  MD A stated he explained to Patient 1 and her husband that the hospital's on call OBGYN provider could perform a rapid evaluation to rule out labor.  MD A stated Patient 1 and her husband had an open conversation and determined they would drive to hospital B because Patient 1 ""really wanted"" to be seen by her OBGYN.  MD A stated he reiterated to Patient 1 and her husband that the hospital could take care of her, but Patient 1 and her husband refused the service offered and left the hospital.    

MD A stated that although the risk and benefits of the examination and treatment were not documented in the medical record they were verbalized to Patient 1 and her husband.  MD A further stated he was not aware that Patient 1 had not signed a refusal of service form.     

On 7/16/13 at 10:05 a.m. during a telephone interview with the triage nurse (RN A), she stated Patient 1 was approximately 31 weeks pregnant with complaints of abdominal pain.  On Patient 1's arrival to the ED, RN A stated Patient 1 was pain free.  RN A called MD A to the triage area to perform a rapid exam.  MD A and Patient 1 had a conversation.  RN A stated MD A palpated Patient 1's abdomen.  After the examination RN A stated MD A reassured Patient 1 and her husband, that Patient 1 had a non-emergent condition, her vital signs were stable, and she had no vaginal bleeding, and it was okay for Patient 1 to either stay at the hospital or go.  RN A further stated Patient 1 appeared uncertain on what to do, but recalled Patient 1 did not want to be seen at the hospital.  RN A stated she did not obtain a refusal of service form from Patient 1 because she believed MD A had discharged    the patient.  

On 7/16/13 at 11 a.m. review of the hospital's ""Refusal of Treatment"" policy and procedure dated 3/12 indicated physicians should document ""the initial refusal and the outcome of the discussion between the patient and the physician..the note should specifically document that the physician gave the patient or legal representative all relevant information, including potential consequences of declining to follow the recommended course of action ...a refusal of permit medical treatment"" form should be completed.     

On 7/16/13 at 11:15 a.m. review of the hospital's ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)"" policy and procedure dated 3/12 indicated ""a hospital's EMTALA stabilization obligation is complete when the....physician must inform the patient and surrogate of the risks and benefits of performing the examination and stabilizing treatment and document a statement to this affect in the patient's medical record"" and, ""take all reasonable steps to secure the patient's or surrogate's written informed consent to refuse examination and treatment"".    

On 7/18/13 at 10 a.m. review of Hospital B's medical record for Patient 1 indicated the patient arrived to the hospital on [DATE] at 2:10 a.m.  Admission diagnoses included preterm labor and ""was having contractions"" on arrival.  Patient 1 was stabilized and was transferred later that day (6/25/13) to Hospital C for a higher level of care.    

On 7/22/13 at 9:30 a.m. review of Hospital C's medical record for Patient 1 indicated the patient was admitted on [DATE] (time unknown).  Patient 1 had unstoppable preterm labor and delivered a baby boy on 6/25/13 at 8:51 p.m..  Baby boy was admitted     to the neonatal intensive care unit.  Patient 1 was discharged    from Hospital C on 6/27/13.

Based on medical record review, nursing interviews, provider interviews, patient interview and review policies and procedures related to EMTALA the facility failed to provide 1 out of 20 patient records sampled from July 2020 - January 2021 (Patient 2) with a medical screening examination (MSE) sufficient to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) existed.  This failure has the potential to place all ED patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) at risk of serious harm or death from an untreated EMC.  

Findings are: 

A.  In a telephone interview on 1/19/21 at 10:15 AM, Patient 2 stated ""That Saturday (1/9/21) I went to the Osmond Hospital because I was having real bad low back pain, it felt like back labor, I also had some discharge and felt terrible.""   ""We just moved here and live 10 minutes from the hospital, so I went there.""  ""I pressed the ED button, I waited about 5 minutes before anyone showed up.""  ""They said they can't help pregnant women, they don't have a monitor and don't do deliveries.""  ""They took me to the nurses desk.""  ""The RN (Registered Nurse) called the on call doctor and she told them about me.""  ""The RN said I needed to drive over to (Hospital B) (35 miles away) for OB care.""  When asked if she was offered to be placed in a room and be examined, Patient 2 stated ""No"". ""I was really frustrated, I tried calling the hospital while I was driving the 10 miles in but there was no answer."" ""I was having  a lot of pain and felt terrible.""  ""I drove myself to the hospital because of COVID and my significant other was home with the kids.""  ""I thought about pulling over and calling 911 so that the ambulance would drive me there, but I made it.""  ""Once I got to (Hospital B) they took me to the labor & delivery floor and the doctor saw me.""  

B.  In an interview on 1/13/21 at 5:40 PM, ED nurse Registered Nurse (RN A) stated that patient (Patient) 2 came to the ED entrance on 1/9/2021.  RN A stated she opened the door and the patient asked ""am I in the right place?""  RN A stated that Patient 2 said she was ""[AGE] years old, 30 weeks pregnant having contractions and vaginal discharge.""  RN A stated, ""she asked if we provided OB (obstetrical) care.""  RN A stated she told Patient 2 that they are a small hospital and OB care is limited, that they have a doppler (machine to hear heart beat) and an emergency delivery kit, and told the patient we could examine her but would probably have to transfer her to (Hospital B).  RN A stated she told the patient she could call the provider on call and escorted Patient 2 to the nursing station.  The on call provider (Nurse Practitioner- NP) B was called and informed that the patient was asking about OB care.  The NP B said we don't have a TOCO (a machine to monitor uterine contractions), Fetal Monitor or infant warmer.  RN A said the patient said ""OK, I am going to (Hospital B) then left."" RN A said ""I didn't get the patient's name.  I called the DON (director of nurses)  right after this happened and told her what happened.  I didn't get a name, she told me to call (Hospital B) and I called and told the OB Supervisor, that a patient came in asking about OB care and told options were limited and she said she was going to your hospital""

C.  In a phone interview on 1/13/21 at 2:00 PM, NP B confirmed she was on call on 1/9/21.  When asked what NP B knew about (Patient 2) on 1/9/21 she said,  ""I got a call Saturday evening after 8:00 PM, the nurse said that there was a 30 week pregnant lady there asking if she should be (at this hospital) and wanted to know if we had OB capabilities.""  ""The RN A said the patient was not asking to be seen, she just wanted to know if she was in the right place.""  ""I told the RN we could evaluate and treat the patient and if she had an OB problem we would send her to (Hospital B), but then the RN said she (the patient) left.""

D.  Review of Patient 2's 1/9/2021 medical record from Hospital B revealed that Patient 2 arrived at 2135 (9:35 PM) complaining of feeling terrible and having severe back pain.  Documentation showed that Patient 2 began having right sided back pain rated 8 out of 10 (10 being the most severe pain), and nausea/vomiting beginning at 7:00 PM (on 1/9/21).  OB Physician A examined the patient and ordered imaging studies including a CT scan (special type of x-ray) of the abdomen and pelvis, and a renal ultrasound (pictures of the kidney's using high frequency sound waves) which showed right sided hydrouretero[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (swelling of the kidney and ureter [tube draining kidney]).  Additionally, various blood tests were obtained including a Complete Blood Count (CBC) which showed that Patient 2 had an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 19.7 [normal range is 4-10, an elevated WBC indicates a possible infection].  A lab test of Patient 2's urine showed a high level of red blood cells 60-80 (normal red blood cell count in the urine is 0-5); 10-20 white blood cells (normal count in the urine is 0-5); 1 + bacteria (should be 0); and the pH (acid/base level) was alkaline at 8.5 (normal pH range is 4.5-8.0, when the urine is more alkaline, there is a greater likelihood of bacteria growing at a rapid rate and as a result a bladder infection can occur more easily).  Further documentation showed that Patient 2 was admitted     as an inpatient for ongoing examination and treatment including intravenous (IV) fluids for hydration, IV pain medications for severe pain, and IV antibiotics to treat a kidney infection.   

E.  In a telephone interview on 1/19/21 at 2:35 PM, Hospital B's OB  physician A stated that at the time of admission on 1/9/21, Patient 2 had an emergency medical condition.  When I saw her she had pyelo[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (disease of the kidney) and pyelonephritis (kidney infection).  She was 29-30 weeks pregnant.  She had a lot of pain.  If she would not have passed the kidney stone and/or if the urologist wouldn't have been there in the morning, I would have transferred the patient to an Omaha hospital.  She mentioned that she was at an outside hospital.  If she had been seen at the other hospital they could have transferred her.  I wouldn't have put her in a car to drive here (35 miles).  She could have passed out from the pain, or gotten septic.
