Based on document review and staff interviews, the Acute Care Hospital staff failed to ensure Patient #8 received a medical screening examination. The investigation involved review of Emergency Department (ED) medical records for 30 sampled patients who presented to the ED seeking care from April 2016 through October 2016. The hospital's administrative staff identified an average of 626 patients each month who presented to the ED requesting emergency medical care and the hospital staff transferred an average of 21 patients per month to another facility.

Failure to provide Patient #8 with a medical screening examination and determine whether there would be adequate time to safely transport to another hospital posed a significant risk to the patient's health and safety and that of her unborn babies (patient # 8 did not know she was pregnant with twins).  This failure potentially could result in Patient #8 delivering her babies in an ambulance, which lacked the equipment and personnel to handle twin births or complications during the birthing process.

Findings included:

1. Review of the document titled ""EMTALA: Medical Screening and Stabilizing Treatment,"" last revised 06/2016, revealed the following in part, ""Any person who comes to the Hospital's dedicated emergency department ... or who a prudent layperson would believe, on the basis of the individual's appearance or behavior, requires examination or treatment for a medical condition, will be provided an appropriate medical screening examination within the capabilities of the dedicated emergency department...""

2. During an interview on 10/19/16 at 2:15 PM, Registered Nurse (RN) A stated that Patient #8 called into the ED, told RN A that she was in the hospital's parking lot, and in active labor. RN A stated she ran to the parking lot and found Patient #8 sitting in her car. Patient #8 told RN A that she was in labor, she had three prior pregnancies, her water had not broken, and her contractions were 2 to 3 minutes apart. 

RN A said that Patient #8 stated she was trying to go to Hospital A (15 miles away) but did not know if the roads had closed due to flooding. RN A said she asked Patient #8 if she wanted to receive an evaluation in the ED.  RN A stated that Patient #8 declined and then she offered Patient #8 an ambulance to transport her to Hospital A. Patient #8 accepted the offer of an ambulance and RN A arranged for an ambulance to transfer Patient #8 to Hospital A. RN A stated she did not push Patient #8 to receive a medical screening examination or document that she had offered an examination but that patient # 8 refused.  

3. During an interview on 10/19/16 at 1:30 PM, House Supervisor B, stated that she was the most senior administrative person on duty when Patient #8 presented to the hospital. House Supervisor B received notification by phone that Patient #8 was in the parking lot. When House Supervisor B arrived in the parking lot, RN A stated that Patient #8 did not want to receive care at Sartori. House Supervisor B acknowledged that normally if a pregnant patient arrived at the hospital, the staff would take the patient inside to the ED and have the ED physician examine the patient prior to transferring a pregnant patient to another hospital. House Supervisor B acknowledged the hospital staff did not provide Patient #8 with a medical screening examination to determine if Patient #8 could safely transfer to a hospital 15 miles away with roads possibly flooded.

4. During an interview on 10/19/16 at 12:10 PM, ED Physician C stated that s/he worked the day Patient #8 presented to Sartori. ED Physician C stated s/he had delivered 10 babies during residency and assisted with at least 30 more deliveries. ED Physician C stated s/he was comfortable examining Patient #8 and delivering her baby if needed. ED Physician C stated s/he did not go to the parking lot to examine Patient #8 or examine Patient #8 in the ambulance prior to the ambulance leaving the hospital's property. ED Physician C acknowledged s/he did not know if Patient #8 could safely make the 15 mile trip to Hospital A without delivering her baby in the ambulance.  ED physician C stated that the ambulance staff would convince patient # 8 to come in and be seen if she needed to be seen.  

5. During an interview on 10/19/16 at 4:20 PM, Health Unit Coordinator (HUC) D stated the ED had the supplies to handle delivering babies. HUC D stated s/he started getting an ED room ready for Patient #8 and gathering the supplies needed to deliver babies. HUC D stopped gathering the supplies when s/he was told that Patient #8 was going to transfer to  Hospital A.

6. Review of Patient #8's emergency medical services (EMS) medical record revealed the patient was on her way to Hospital A and ""when the pain began to get too severe, she pulled into the Sartori parking lot"" and called the ED.  Further documentation showed the patient rated her pain a 10 out of 10 (most severe pain) and that the ambulance left Sartori Medical Center at 10:04 PM on 9/23/16 and arrived at Hospital A at 10:21 PM on 9/23/16.  

7. During an interview on 10/19/16 at 4:50 PM, Paramedic F stated the ambulance only had one set of the supplies needed to deliver a baby. The ambulance lacked sufficient supplies to deliver more than one baby.  Additionally, Paramedic F stated they lacked the capabilities in the ambulance to handle complications with a delivery.  Paramedic F stated that Patient # 8 was driving to Hospital A but decided to pull into the parking lot at Sartori because of a very painful contraction.  ""She was having a contraction every two to three minutes.""  ""This was her fourth pregnancy.""  Paramedic F stated that ""After the fact, I discovered [name of patient # 8] had twins and she did not get any prenatal care.""  

8. Review of Patient #8's medical record from Hospital A revealed Patient #8 did not know she was pregnant with twins and that she delivered her first baby 30 minutes after arriving at  Hospital A and her second baby 5 minutes after the first. 

9. During an interview on 10/20/16 at 2:10 PM, RN E stated s/he worked at Hospital A. When the EMS crew gave report on Patient #8, the EMS staff told RN E the EMS staff felt they could safely travel to Hospital A, but did not know if they could return to Cedar Falls (the city where Sartori Memorial Hospital was located) in the case of an emergency during the transfer.

Review of the form and medical record failed to reveal any available documentation by the physician certifying the transfer indicating that the benefits and increased risks of transfer specific to the patient's emergency medical condition of Preterm Contractions at 27.2 weeks and questionable early chorioamnionitits were explained to the patient.  Further review revealed the date and time (09/25/2015 at 0330) of the physician's certification for transfer DID NOT closely match the date and time (09/25/2015 at 0524) of the patient's transfer.  Review revealed Physician B signed the ""Patient Transfer Form"" (Physician Certification) 114 minutes prior to Patient #20's departure from Hospital A's L&D unit for transfer to Hospital B.   

Hospital B (Recipient Facility) closed medical record review on 10/30/2015 for Patient #20 revealed the patient was a direct admit to High Risk Antepartum Bed 3105-1 on 09/25/2015 at 0709 with an admitting diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]""...PLAN:  ...No current evidence of preterm labor. ..."" and at 1206 revealed ""Plan: ...Discharge home today.""  

Telephone interview on 10/29/2015 at 1045 with Physician B revealed she was on the medical staff of Hospital A.  Interview revealed she had been on the medical staff for approximately 5.5 years.  Interview revealed she was an OB/GYN (Obstetrical/Gynecology) physician.  Interview revealed she was the attending physician who performed the MSE on Patient #20 on 09/25/2015 and transferred her to Hospital B.  Interview revealed patients under 32 weeks are transferred and do not deliver at Hospital A.  Interview revealed the patient was transferred due to pre-term contractions at 27+ weeks and questionable chorioamnionitits.   Interview revealed the closest hospital to transfer the patient too was Hospital B.  Interview revealed she arranged for the transfer.  Interview revealed Hospital B had accepted the patient and had bed availability.  Interview revealed the patient was transferred by ground ambulance.  Interview revealed she completed the paperwork and signed the transfer form.  Interview revealed she signs, dates and times the form ""as soon as I get the ok and acceptance of patient information.""  Interview revealed the time of transfer depends on ambulance availability.  Interview revealed ""it can be as quick as 20 minutes and sometimes takes hours.""  Interview revealed if there is a delay in the time of transfer, she does not routinely go back and re-sign, re-date, and re-time the transfer form to closely match the actual time the patient is transferred from the L&D to the other hospital.  Interview revealed she ""lets the form stand.""  Interview revealed risk and benefits are usually explained to the patient and/or guardian by the physician.  Interview revealed the nurses have the patient and/or guardian sign the transfer form.  Interview revealed there was ""no imminent delivery"" but the patient was transferred for a ""higher level of care.""  Interview revealed specific increased risks associated with the patient were ""small risk of delivery of baby"" and ""abruption (of placenta)"" and ""becoming lightheaded and dizzy"" and ""health deterioration.""  Interview revealed specific benefits of transfer included ""NICU availability, Ventilator management and maintenance, Staffing and Physicians' experience, equipment availability, and OB Services with increased support for mom.""  Interview revealed she does not routinely write specific risks and benefits related to the patient's emergency medical condition on the transfer form.  Interview revealed ""there are boxes to check, that are globally accepted so I just check them.""  Interview revealed ""I usually put a check mark in the box, only.""  Interview confirmed Physician B failed to document the medical benefits and increased risks associated with the transfer for the specific EMC and condition of Patient #20 at the time of transfer and failed to sign, date and time the Patient Transfer Form (Physician Certification) to closely match the actual date and time of the patient's transfer.  

Interview on 10/29/2015 at 1200 with CNO #1 revealed there was no available documentation in the medical record where Physician B documented the medical benefits and increased risks associated with the transfer for the specific EMC and condition of Patient #20 at the time of transfer and signed, dated and timed the Patient Transfer Form (Physician Certification) to closely match the actual date and time of the patient's transfer.

Based on staff interview, review of medical records and facility's policies/procedures, the hospital failed to stabilize one (#1) of 10 obstetric (OB) patients prior to discharge.  Specifically, the OB patient was actively bleeding when the on-call physician discharged    the patient and told the patient to drive to another sister hospital.

The findings were:

The facility's policy and procedure entitled, ""EMTALA - Stabilization,"" stated the following in pertinent part: 
""b. Stable For Discharge - A patient is considered stable for discharge when, within reasonable clinical confidence, it is determined that the patient has reached the point where his/her continued care, including diagnostic workup and/or treatment, could be reasonably performed as an outpatient or later as an inpatient, provided the patient is given a plan for appropriate follow-up care with the discharge instructions.""

Sample patient #1, a [AGE]-year-old female, presented to the L&D on 6/19/11 at approximately 11:43 p.m. for a preterm labor check.  The following was documented in nursing notes and stated in pertinent part:
6/19/11 23:45 (11:45 p.m.) - ""G4P3 (gravida/para) with EDC (estimated date of confinement - due date) 10/9/11 at 24 and 1/7 weeks to unit with C/O (complaints of) ""strong"" UC's (uterine contractions) since 2200 (10:00 p.m.).  Pt. has had ""mild cramping"" and yellow mucousy discharge with pink streaks since Friday (6/17/11)."" 

6/20/11 00:05 (12:05 a.m.) - ""(On-call physician name) updated on pt. status, aware of gestational age, complaint of UC's and Prenatal history.  MD aware of UC pattern and audible fetal heart tones.  Aware of pt. complaint of pink discharge.  Orders received for labs...""

6/20/11 01:40 (1:40 a.m.) - ""Spoke to (on-call physician name). Reported lab results including: CRP (C-Reactive Protein), WBC (White Blood Cells), and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] counts.  (Note: All these lab results were out-of-range and elevated.)  Also reported pt. UC pattern and pain level...Instructed to notify if UC's become closer together or stronger.""

6/20/11 02:55 (2:55 a.m.) - ""Spoke to (on-call physician name).  Reported one UC in last hour.  Received orders to discharge patient and have her follow up in clinic first thing in morning.""

6/20/11 03:00 (3:00 a.m.) - ""Pt. up to br (bathroom).  Pt. reports blood ""dripping in toilet"" and blood streaks on toilet paper when wiping.  Pt. instructed to return to bed.  (On-call physician name) paged.""

6/20/11 03:05 (3:05 a.m.) - ""Spoke to (on-call physician name).  Reported bleeding from vagina.  Asked to verify whether or not patient had previa on previous u/s (ultrasound).  Told (on-call physician name) that there was no previa on u/s.  Orders remain to discharge pt. to home with f/u (follow-up) in office in a.m.""

6/20/11 03:08 (3:08 a.m.) - ""(On-call physician name) called unit, states s/he wants pt. to be instructed to go to (sister hospital name-approximately 15 miles) immediately for evaluation.""

6/20/11 03:10 (3:10 a.m.) - ""Discharge instructions given to patient who verbalizes understanding.  Pt. to f/u in office tomorrow knows to call as soon as office opens in a.m.""

6/20/11 03:13 (3:13 a.m.) - ""Pt. instructed to drive to (sister hospital name) in own vehicle for further evaluation per MD order. Pt. verbalizes understanding of this instruction."" 

6/20/11 03:20 (3:20 a.m.) - ""Pt. discharged    in wheelchair to own vehicle.  FOC (father of child) at side.  Report called to (sister hospital name) charge RN.""

The L&D Discharge Screening Tool for sample patient #1 was completed by the nurse after the patient had been discharged   .  The patient was rated as follows with a total of 14 points:
Multi-parity: 1 point
Duration of last labor: 1 point
Vaginal bleeding without UC's: 8 points
Gestation 20.0-27.6 weeks: 4 points.
The instructions on the ""L&D Discharge Screening Tool"" stated the following: ""A patient with a score of 8 or greater shall not be transferred or referred to another facility except for care not available at MCR (Medical Center of the Rockies) or by patient initiated transfer or departure against medical advice.  Obstetric Provider must evaluate patient in person if transfer initiated.  Regardless of score the Obstetric RN may request an Obstetric Provider exam at any time.""

A tour of the L&D unit was conducted on 7/19/11 at approximately 8:50 a.m. with the Interim Director and the APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurse).  The concern was expressed regarding sample patient #1 being discharged    and told to go to the sister facility by private vehicle rather than being transferred by ambulance.  The Director agreed that a transfer by ambulance to the sister facility would have been more appropriate. 

An interview was conducted on 7/19/11 at approximately 9:30 a.m. with the CNO (Chief Nursing Officer) and the Director of Quality Resources & Risk Management.  The Director of Quality was also appointed to be the interim Director of Obstetrics (OB).  The CNO stated that rather than discharging the patient a preliminary procedure could have been performed at the hospital and the patient flown in utero to a contracted hospital in Denver that had the capability of caring for the premature infant.  The sister hospital where the patient was referred to did not have the capability of caring for a premature infant of 24+ weeks. 

In summary, according to documentation the patient was actively bleeding and not in a stabilized condition to be discharged    and told to drive by private vehicle to another hospital.  The hospital had the capability of providing stabilizing treatment; however, the on-call physical failed to physically be present and utilize the services available at the hospital.

Based on review of medical records, ambulance trip reports, and Policy and procedures and interviews the facility failed to ensure that an individual who presented to the dedicated emergency department with presenting signs and symptoms of vaginal bleeding and abdominal  pain was provided an appropriate medical screening examination that was within the capability and capacity of hospital to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for 1 (#14) of 25 sampled patients.


Findings:


Closed clinical record review on 3/14/2017 for Patient revealed that Patient #14 presented by ambulance to Hospital A's DED on 02/17/2017 at 1323 (Visit #2).  Review of the ambulance run report revealed Patient #14 complained of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and nausea, with vital signs of BP 106/58; P 85; R 18; and SpO2 100.  Patient #14 received a Saline Lock IV, and 4 mg (milligrams) Zofran IV, which helped relieved her nausea symptoms while enroute to Carolina East Medical Center (Hospital A).  Patient #14's vital signs at 1325 were: BP 102/72; P 99; R 18; T 37.0 ° C; and SpO2 98 % RA.  Review of a triage note, written by Registered Nurse (RN) #1 on 02/17/2017 at 1324, revealed, ""Chief Complaint: 6 wks (weeks) preg (pregnant) vag (vaginal) bleeding abd (abdominal) pain.  Seen here last night for same and had Vag US 'empty sac' and HCG had dropped.  Told was poss (possibly) aborting.  Told to come back for bleeding.  Is having some cramping.  Using 1 pad/hr (hour)...""  Review of an ED Irregular Discharge note, written by RN #1 on 02/17/2017 at 2046 (6 hours and 23 minutes after presentation to the DED), revealed, ""...Left Without Treatment... ED Irregular Discharge Comment: Called x (times) 2 no answer.""  There was no documentation in the medical record to indicate that patient #14 was re-evaluated by a qualified medical person for her presenting signs and symptoms complaint of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding when she (MDS) dated [DATE].

Based on record review and interview Monroe County Hospital, failed to provide an appropriate transfer for one patient (#4) of the twenty-two (22) sampled who presented to the  emergency room    (ER) requesting treatment of pregnancy after her water had broke, with a history of premature labor.  As a result of Monroe County Hospital's failure to provide an appropriate transfer an immediate and serious threat to patient #4 ' s health and safety and the safety of the patient's unborn child occurred.

Findings:

Review of the facility's emergency room    (ER) Log revealed patient #4 actually (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2:00 a.m. and the discharge time was noted as 06/03/13 at 2:15 a.m.   

Patient #4's medical record revealed Registration Clerk #6 called Registered Nurse (RN) #7 to the waiting room to speak with patient #4, a pregnant woman whose water had broken.  The nurses' notes revealed the patient was 36 weeks pregnant and that the patient had contacted her private physician to inform the physician that her water had broken.  The nurse noted that the patient was from out-of-state and that arrangements had been made for a physician in Macon to follow her care while she was in Georgia.  The nurse noted that the patient denied having any contractions and that the patient had driven herself to the ER.  The nurse noted that she went to the nurses' station and called ER  physician #8 and informed the physician of the following:  
--that the woman was 36 weeks pregnant,
--that her water had broken and that the woman denied having any contractions,
-- that this was the woman's second pregnancy and that the first child had been a pre-term delivery, 
--that the woman had a physician in Macon covering her pregnancy, and 
--that the woman wanted or needed to get to Macon.  

In addition, nurse #7 noted that the ER  physician #8 told her that it was alright for the woman to leave and go to Macon.  The nurse noted that she informed the woman of the ER  physician's response, asked the woman again if she was by herself and was informed that the woman had driven herself to the ER.  The nurse noted that she escorted the woman to the patient's private automobile and that the woman then called 911.  Nurses' notes revealed evidence that the nurse called the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatch to let them know that they would be getting a call from the woman.  The nurse also noted that she did not get the patient's name.  

The medical record had no evidence of an appropriate transfer for patient #4.

Review of the EMS trip report revealed evidence that the ambulance attendants received a call on 06/03/13 at 2:23 a.m. to respond to a woman in labor (#4) and that the patient had a history of delivering prematurely.  Documentation revealed the EMS were given the address of the Dialysis Center across the street from the hospital.  The EMS report revealed evidence that the ambulance arrived on the scene at 2:29 a.m.  Documentation revealed the patient was found sitting in a car and that the patient reported that her water had broken about 15 minutes prior to the EMS being called.  The EMS report noted that the patient was actively feeling pressure but did not feel the need to push.  The EMS report noted that the patient's history included three (3) pregnancies and two (2) deliveries.  The report also noted that the patient had had no prenatal care because she had just found out a month ago that she was pregnant.  In addition, the report noted that the patient had a history of pre-term labor.  The EMS report noted that an assessment revealed there was no crowning and that the patient had no desire to push but felt some pressure in her rear end.  The report noted the ambulance left the scene at 2:36 a.m. and arrived at the receiving facility at 2:48 a.m. where the patient was left in the care of the obstetric (specializing in the care of pregnant women) staff.  

The ""Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff of Monroe County Hospital"", reviewed and last revised 03/27/12, revealed  the attending physician was required to write a transfer order and make the transfer arrangements, documentation of the accepting facility and accepting physician, and assess and stabilize the patient prior to transfer.  A copy of all pertinent medical records was also to accompany the transferred patient. 

Review of the ""Professional Services agreement between HospitalMD (HMD), LLC and Monroe County Hospital"" entered into on 04/08/13, revealed on page 2, that the term ""professional services"" shall be those Emergency Medical (EM) Services described on Exhibit ""A"".  On page 18, this contract revealed ""HMD shall cause all physicians to comply with requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). 

Review of the facility's ""Transfer of Patients from MCH (Monroe County Hospital)"", dated 06/2010, revealed the policy was to facilitate transfers from the hospital in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to ensure that Patient 1, a pregnant female and her unborn child, received an appropriate Medical Screening Examination (MSE) to determine if an emergency condition existed, upon presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). The hospital failed to ensure that the ED staff provided an uniform standard quality of patient care, treatment and efficiency consistent with generally accepted standards as evidenced by:

1.  The facility failed to recognize and identify the signs and symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

2.  The facility failed to obtain an Obstetrical (OB, physician specializing in the treatment of pregnant patients) consult;

3.  The facility failed to closely monitor Patient 1;

4.  The facility failed to obtain a necessary but routine urine test to check for protein in the urine (proteinuria); and

5.  The facility failed to have emergency room    policies in place to address the care and transfer of high risk pregnant patients. 

These failures resulted in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of Preeclampsia and caused the condition to progress to[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (seizures or convulsions in a pregnant patient) which led to the death of both Patient 1 and her unborn child.  

Due to the identification of the deficient practices related to the MSE and lack of stabilizing treatment for Patient 1, the lack of written policies and procedures to provide guidance to staff regarding the care of obstetrical (pregnant) patients who present to the ED, as well as the lack of a plan of action to prevent similar incidents from happening again, an Immediate Jeopardy was declared on 10/10/13 at 12:30 pm with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO).  

The Hospital implemented a plan of action that included the following: all pregnant patients 20 weeks gestation or greater would be screened for symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s urine to check for protein), deep tendon reflexes documented, BP every 15 minutes and if BP consistently elevated - equal or greater than 140/90 - an OB (Obstetrician, physician specializing in the treatment of pregnant patients) consult would be obtained, fetal heart tones, assessment for edema, if OB consultation resulted in the recommendation to transfer or MSE indicated the need to transfer, transfer arrangements would be made immediately. 

The Immediate Jeopardy was abated on 10/10/13 at 5:30 pm after the hospital implemented a corrective plan of action to ensure patients' safety.  The survey team evaluated the plan of action as well as the methods to disseminate the information to nursing and medical staff, prior to starting their next shifts in the ED. 

Findings:

A review of Patient 1's record disclosed that she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:12 pm, with the chief complaint of upper stomach pain.  Patient 1 was noted to be 38 weeks pregnant, with an estimated due date of 10/10/13.  Patient 1's initial BP was 172/110 (normal for 3rd trimester pregnancy is less than 140/90-very high maternal blood pressure stops the fetus from getting enough blood and oxygen and could cause the mother to have a stroke or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain which could lead to brain damage and death).  The ED physician (MD) A examined Patient 1 and noted that she had a mild headache, Fetal Heart Tones (baby's heart rate) were 132, and patient denied any complication related to her pregnancy.  Maalox (over the counter medication for the treatment of heartburn) with Viscous Lidocaine (medication that provides a numbing effect), Protonix (an anti-ulcer medication also used to treat heartburn and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), and Tylenol were given to Patient 1 for her complaint of epigastric (upper abdominal) pain.  Patient 1's repeat BP was 160/94.  Patient 1 was discharged    at 10:40 pm (remained in the ED for 1 1/2 hours) and told to return to the hospital in the morning for an ultrasound (machine that uses sound waves to create pictures of internal organs or a baby).  diagnoses included [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s problem list/discharge diagnoses. 

After Patient 1 returned home, an ambulance was called at 11:11 pm and arrived at her home at 11:20 pm. Patient 1 was taken to another facility (Hospital E).  Upon arrival, Patient 1 began having seizures and her baby was found to be without a heartbeat and was delivered stillborn.  Patient 1 expired the following day, on 10/1/13.
	
The following was noted in an article published in 3/2009 by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), titled, ""Focus On: Preeclampsia.""  ""Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension and proteinuria (protein in the urine) that occur after 20 weeks gestation.  Management should focus on blood pressure control, seizure prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment, and delivery when necessary.  Although obstetric consultation is warranted in every case of Preeclampsia, emergency physicians should be comfortable with the initial management.""  

""Diagnostic criteria for Preeclampsia include a systolic BP (the first or top number in a BP reading) greater than 140 or a diastolic BP (the last or bottom number in a BP reading) greater than 90 in a woman who was normotensive (normal BP) prior to 20 weeks gestation. Severe Preeclampsia is diagnosed    by a systolic BP greater than 160 or diastolic BP greater than 110, excess proteinuria, severe oliguria (lack of urine), cerebral or visual disturbances, pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs), impaired liver function, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (abnormally low amount of platelets (part of the blood that help it to clot), or fetal [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].""  

""Delivery is the definitive treatment for Preeclampsia and should be considered after 34 weeks gestation in the case of severe Preeclampsia and 37 weeks gestation in mild Preeclampsia...Any patient with severe Preeclampsia should be started on magnesium, because it has been proven to prevent progression to[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (new onset grand-mal seizures in a woman with Preeclampsia).""

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published an article in 12/2011, titled, ""Emergent Therapy for Acute-Onset, Severe Hypertension with Preeclampsia or[DIAGNOSES REDACTED]"" that read, ""Acute-onset persistent (lasting 15 minutes or more), severe systolic (greater than or equal to 160) or severe diastolic hypertension (greater than or equal to 110) or both in pregnant or postpartum (immediately after giving birth and extending for six weeks) women with Preeclampsia or[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] constitutes a hypertensive emergency.  Severe systolic hypertension may be the most important predictor of cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) and infarction (tissue death caused by lack of oxygen) in these patients and if not treated expeditiously (quickly)can result in maternal death...Close maternal and fetal monitoring by the physician and nursing staff are advised.""

During a record review and interview on 10/9/13 at 2:25 pm, ED Physician (MD) A confirmed she was the physician who cared for Patient 1 when she came to the ED, on 9/29/13.  MD A stated she examined Patient 1 who complained of burning in the epigastric area.  Patient 1 told her that she had eaten hot peppers with a meat sandwich then started having epigastric pain a couple of hours later.  Patient 1 denied being in labor and reported no problems with this pregnancy. Patient 1 was non-English speaking and a family member interpreted.

The problem list/discharge diagnoses were reviewed and included epigastric pain of uncertain etiology probably GERD, possible biliary colic, and term pregnancy. MD A said she would not add anything to that list such as high blood pressure because Patient 1's BP had decreased by the time of discharge.  MD A confirmed Patient 1's initial BP was 172/110 and last BP, prior to discharge, was 160/94. MD A stated that she would not add headache to the problem list because it was her sense that Patient 1's headache was mild and not unusual.  

MD A stated she had been concerned with Patient 1's initial BP of 172/110, but explained that pain could cause an elevated BP.  MD A stated that Patient 1's BP, prior to discharge was 160/94.  She confirmed that this BP was not ok for a pregnant patient, but the patient seemed to want to go home and take the same medications she had been given while in the ED, so Patient 1 was discharged   .   MD A confirmed if she had a problem with a patient, she could call Hospital E (a trauma center with high risk OB services) but did not do so in this case.  MD A said, in retrospect, she should have made Patient 1 stay in the ED until her BP became normal or transfer Patient 1 to Hospital E. 

MD A was asked about the symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  

During an interview on 10/10/13 at 11:35 am, ED MD B confirmed he was the Medical Director of the ED and Chief of Staff.  MD B stated they see about 450-550 patients per month in the ED and about 5% of those patients were pregnant, including all stages of pregnancy.  MD B was asked what the hallmark signs and symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

MD B confirmed that he had reviewed Patient 1's record.  MD B stated that the care given to Patient 1 was ""inexcusable.""  Patient 1's BP upon discharge was 160/94.  MD B stated that he would be worried with a BP that was lower than that.  He stated that Patient 1 had been discharged    with an unacceptably high BP.  MD B stated he would have documented the absence or presence of edema, would have done a urinalysis (urine test) for proteinuria, and would have called the Obstetrician.  

During a record review and interview on 10/9/13 at 1 pm, Registered Nurse (RN) C confirmed that he gave Patient 1 the following medications as ordered by MD A: Maalox with Viscous Lidocaine, Protonix, and Tylenol.  RN C stated that he re-assessed Patient 1 about 10 to 15 minutes after he gave the medications and again about 25 minutes later.  RN C stated that Patient 1's pain level had decreased but at the last assessment Patient 1 still rated her epigastric pain as a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 (one was minimal and 10 very severe). RN C stated that Patient 1's BP was rechecked once during the time she remained in the ED and it was 160/94.  He was unsure of the exact time, but stated that it was within one hour of discharge and this was reported to MD A.  RN C stated that Patient 1 had complained of a headache.  After reviewing the record RN C stated he believed Patient 1 was discharged    at 10:40 pm.

RN C stated that if a patient needed treatment that could not be provided at their facility (Hospital I), they would call Hospital E and transfer the patient there.  He also stated that they could call the ED at Hospital E for advice, if needed.  

During a record review and interview on 10/9/13 at 2:25 pm, MD A was asked if a urine test to check for protein had been done.  MD A explained that there was no lab staff present at the time Patient 1 was in the ED.  She stated that there would have been a lab person on call but she would have taken 30 minutes to get to the hospital.  MD A confirmed she did not order a urine test although she stated that if a urine dipstick (a test strip that is dipped into a cup of the patient's urine to check for protein) had been available in the ED, she would have used it. 

During an interview on 10/10/13 at 10:10 am, the Lab Manager (LM D) confirmed she had been on call on 9/29/13.  LM D stated that the required response time per their protocol was 20 minutes.  She confirmed that 90% of the time she has arrived within 20 minutes of being called.  LM D stated that urine dipsticks were available in their lab and confirmed that protein was one of the things that could be checked.  LM D stated it would take five minutes to do the test and if positive, further testing would be done under the microscope.  

During a record review and interview on 10/10/13 at 11:35 am, MD B confirmed that the MSE for Patient 1 was done at 9:42 pm on 9/29/13 and Patient 1 was discharged    at 10:40 pm, so there would have been time for the lab tech to have been called in and have the urinalysis done to check for proteinuria, had it been ordered, before Patient 1 was discharged    home. 

A review of Hospital I's ED policy and procedure manual disclosed there were no policies that dealt with the care and treatment of Obstetrical patients who presented to the ED.  During an interview on 10/9/13 at 11:30 am, the Chief Nursing Officer confirmed that they had no such policies and procedures.

During an interview on 10/10/13 at 11:35 am, MD B was asked about the lack of policies pertaining to treatment of Obstetrical patients in the ED.  MD B stated that he sees the policies when they're updated, but he does not peruse all of them.  He stated that a policy was not something that they would look up frequently.  MD B confirmed that a plan of action to prevent similar incidents from happening again had not yet been formulated.     

During an interview on 10/10/13 at 12:10 pm, the CNO confirmed that she had started on the investigation and root cause analysis into this incident, but had not completed it.  She confirmed that she had no written plan of action to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

MD A failed to recognize the hallmark signs and symptoms (severe high blood pressure) of Preeclampsia and failed to complete an adequate MSE including a routine urine dipstick to test for proteinuria and did not obtain an OB consult.  There was no close monitoring of Patient 1 for the 1 1/2 hours she remained in the ED despite presenting with severe high blood pressure (hypertension, HTN) that did not return to normal, and epigastric pain that was not fully relieved.

MD A failed to recognize that Patient 1 had an emergency medical condition due to failure to perform an adequate MSE, did not treat Patient 1's severe HTN, and discharged    Patient 1 home without adequate treatment and stabilization. 

","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to ensure that Patient 1, a pregnant female and her unborn child, received an appropriate Medical Screening Examination (MSE) to determine if an emergency condition existed, upon presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). The hospital failed to ensure that the ED staff provided an uniform standard quality of patient care, treatment and efficiency consistent with generally accepted standards as evidenced by:

1.  The facility failed to recognize and identify the signs and symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

2.  The facility failed to obtain an Obstetrical (OB, physician specializing in the treatment of pregnant patients) consult;

3.  The facility failed to closely monitor Patient 1;

4.  The facility failed to obtain a necessary but routine urine test to check for protein in the urine (proteinuria); and

5.  The facility failed to have emergency room    policies in place to address the care and transfer of high risk pregnant patients. 

These failures resulted in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of Preeclampsia and caused the condition to progress to[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (seizures or convulsions in a pregnant patient) which led to the death of both Patient 1 and her unborn child.  

Due to the identification of the deficient practices related to the MSE and lack of stabilizing treatment for Patient 1, the lack of written policies and procedures to provide guidance to staff regarding the care of obstetrical (pregnant) patients who present to the ED, as well as the lack of a plan of action to prevent similar incidents from happening again, an Immediate Jeopardy was declared on 10/10/13 at 12:30 pm with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO).  

The Hospital implemented a plan of action that included the following: all pregnant patients 20 weeks gestation or greater would be screened for symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s urine to check for protein), deep tendon reflexes documented, BP every 15 minutes and if BP consistently elevated - equal or greater than 140/90 - an OB (Obstetrician, physician specializing in the treatment of pregnant patients) consult would be obtained, fetal heart tones, assessment for edema, if OB consultation resulted in the recommendation to transfer or MSE indicated the need to transfer, transfer arrangements would be made immediately. 

The Immediate Jeopardy was abated on 10/10/13 at 5:30 pm after the hospital implemented a corrective plan of action to ensure patients' safety.  The survey team evaluated the plan of action as well as the methods to disseminate the information to nursing and medical staff, prior to starting their next shifts in the ED. 

Findings:

A review of Patient 1's record disclosed that she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:12 pm, with the chief complaint of upper stomach pain.  Patient 1 was noted to be 38 weeks pregnant, with an estimated due date of 10/10/13.  Patient 1's initial BP was 172/110 (normal for 3rd trimester pregnancy is less than 140/90-very high maternal blood pressure stops the fetus from getting enough blood and oxygen and could cause the mother to have a stroke or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain which could lead to brain damage and death).  The ED physician (MD) A examined Patient 1 and noted that she had a mild headache, Fetal Heart Tones (baby's heart rate) were 132, and patient denied any complication related to her pregnancy.  Maalox (over the counter medication for the treatment of heartburn) with Viscous Lidocaine (medication that provides a numbing effect), Protonix (an anti-ulcer medication also used to treat heartburn and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), and Tylenol were given to Patient 1 for her complaint of epigastric (upper abdominal) pain.  Patient 1's repeat BP was 160/94.  Patient 1 was discharged    at 10:40 pm (remained in the ED for 1 1/2 hours) and told to return to the hospital in the morning for an ultrasound (machine that uses sound waves to create pictures of internal organs or a baby).  diagnoses included [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s problem list/discharge diagnoses. 

After Patient 1 returned home, an ambulance was called at 11:11 pm and arrived at her home at 11:20 pm. Patient 1 was taken to another facility (Hospital E).  Upon arrival, Patient 1 began having seizures and her baby was found to be without a heartbeat and was delivered stillborn.  Patient 1 expired the following day, on 10/1/13.

Based on review of facility policies, facility bylaws, rules and regulations, facility listing, medical record reviews and interviews, the facility failed to ensure patients with identified emergency psychaitric conditions were transferred to Hospital #1's inpatient psychiatric unit which had the capacity and capability to treat the patients. The hospital failed to minimize the risks to the patients' health by allowing patients with psychaitric conditions to remain in Hospital #1's Emergency Department (ED) for lengthy periods of time without treatment while waiting to be transferred to an outside hospital.  The failure of the hospital to admit and treat patients with psychaitric conditions resulted in the inappropriate transfer of 19 of 27 (Patient's 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14-1, 14-2, 14-3, 14-4, 14-5, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26) patients who presented to Hospital #1's ED seeking treatment for a psychaitric condition.  

The findings included:

4. Review of a patient list presented to the surveyors by the Quality Improvement Manager on 12/28/17 at 8:00 AM, revealed the Transfer Center (Call Center) did not refer to (named Hospital #3) for admission.  Two patients (Patients #9 and 10) were declined because there was no ADA [American Disabilities Act] room and lack of nursing staff.  Twenty-two patients were not referred to the on-site psychiatric hospital (Hospital #3) for treatment.  Those patients were:  Patients #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14-1, 14-2, 14-3, 14-4, 14-5, 15, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27.

Based on interview, review of documentation in the medical record 7 of 8 medical records of patients who were transferred to other hospitals (Patients 1, 2, 3, 14, 15 and 16), or were ""discharged   "" and told by hospital staff to go directly to another hospital (Patient 4), review of medical staff rules and regulations, review of policies and procedures, review of staff training records, and review of event report documentation, it was determined that the hospital failed to fully develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved:
* Regarding Patient 4:
The hospital failed to provide stabilizing treatment to the patient who was 39 weeks pregnant and experiencing contractions and ""severe range"" blood pressure before discharging the patient and instructing him/her to go directly to another hospital by private vehicle with a significant other during night hours for insurance reasons when the hospital had capability and capacity to admit the patient. 
- The receiving hospital had not accepted the patient due to the patient's instability.
- Physician certification of medical benefits and risks were not documented for the patient.
- Medical records were not sent to the receiving facility for the patient.
- A Transfer Form was not completed for the patient as required by hospital policy. 

This situation created an imminent risk of the likelihood of harm to this patient and the unborn child, and harm to other patients.

Based on review of facility policy and medical records (MR) and staff (EMP) interview, it was determined the facility failed to maintain a complete Emergency Department (ED) control log for October 2021, through February 2022.

Findings include:
Review on March 8, 2022, of the facility policy ""EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act)"" effective March 3, 2022, revealed  ""VIII Signs and Records...4. The Hospital will maintain a central log on each individual who comes to the hospital seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, or whether he or she was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   .""
A review of video footage revealed on February 26, 2022, at 9:19 PM pregnant female patient arrived in parking lot of Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital. At 9:22 PM pregnant female patient arrived inside to the security desk.  EMP4 went to get assistance.  At that time, EMP5 and EMP6 spoke with female. EMP6 was observed walking behind female in labor talking to her.  
Interview conducted on March 8, 2020, at 12:00 PM with EMP4 revealed that EMP4 was the security guard on duty that shift.  EMP4 stated ""My encounter with the patient was when she entered the ED.  I greeted her and asked her why she was here.  The patient said that she was in labor.  I ran to the back and shouted the lady is in labor.

The other tech took over, you know how some people take over and act like they can give advice.  The other tech advised the patient to go to another hospital.  We do not have OB (Obstetrician) at this hospital.  The patient agreed to go to another hospital.  I repeatedly asked the patient if she was okay to drive and the patient said yes.  I asked the patient if she wanted to a doctor.  The patient said she would drive to the other hospital.  I asked her if she was okay to drive and she said yes.""

Interview conducted on March 8, 2022, at 2:00 PM with EMP5: ""I was near fast track around room 24, security came to tell them there was a pregnant woman who looked calm cool and collected - unphased.  Since Delaware County is only six minutes away, if you feel capable you can go, but if you can't handle it we can see you here.  Another gentleman continued to talk to her when I returned to the unit.""  When EMP5 was asked if she received EMTALA Training EMP5 stated: ""I am new, November 2021, I couldn't remember if that was part of orientation, but I did receive orientation with a lot of information in it.  I don't recall that specific Act.""

Based on document review and staff interview, it was determined that in 1 of 20 (Pt #1) Emergency Department (ED) records reviewed, the Hospital failed to ensure that all patients who came to the Emergency Department (ED) were provided an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE). This has the potential to affect all patients receiving care in an ED that treats approximately 34 patients a day.

Findings include:        

1. On 08/31/2022 at approximately 10:00 AM the policy, ""Triage: COBRA Compliance (revised 2007)"" was reviewed. The policy stated ""Procedure.... 2.... d. Any individual regardless of the reason for their visit, including pregnant women in labor, who, in the opinion of the triage personal, their own opinion and/or that of the people accompanying them, exhibit a sudden change in a chronic condition or present with the acute onset of symptoms which could constitute an emergency or urgent condition, will be directed by triage personnel directly and immediately to the care of a department nurse who will begin the evaluation and/or treatment without delay, notifying the appropriate physician as soon as it is practical."" 

2. On 08/31/2022 at approximately 11:30 AM, the ED patient log was reviewed.  Pt #1 was on the ED log indicating Pt #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 11:02 PM with a chief complaint of ""eval."" The log stated ""Acuity Level: N/A, Providers: N/A, Diagnosis: N/A, Discharge Disposition: Duplicate/Invalid, discharge date   /Time: 08/09/2022 11:05 PM."" 

3. On 08/31/2022 at approximately 11:45 AM, an interview was conducted with the Director of Quality and Safety (E #1) and the Chief Nursing Officer (E #3). E #1 stated ""We had received a phone call from the Perinatal Center with concerns related to a pt who presented to (Receiving Facility) stating that (Pt #1) had presented to (Transferring Hospital) with concerns that (Pt #1's) water had broke. We started an investigation. Initially, there was no patient record (not on the log). Based on information provided by the Perinatal Center and a review of our cameras in the ED, we determined when the patient presented and when the patient left. We logged a Sensor (Patient Safety) event and spoke with the nurse.""

4. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 9:00 AM, the video footages of the ED lobby and the ED hallway (outside of the triage room by the ED entrance/exit doors) were reviewed. The video footage from the ED lobby showed a Pt #1 presented to the registration desk at 11:02 PM. E #4 is noted taking Pt #1 and significant other through the ED door at 11:02 PM. Video footage from the ED hallway shows E #4 walking to lobby and bringing Pt #1 and significant other back into the triage room at 11:02 PM. Two and a half minutes later, significant other walks out the ED exit doors. At 11:05 PM E #4 escorts Pt #1 out the ED exit door to the lobby. Pt #1 continues and exits the hospital.   

5. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 2:30 PM, an interview was conducted with ED Nurse (E #4). E #4 stated ""Pt came in with significant other stating thought water had broke and was 25 weeks and 6 days pregnant. I told the patient the services we could offer and told the pt the hospital would be glad to see (Pt #1). The patient sent the significant other out to get the car. The patient asked me if (Pt #1) should go on or stay. I explained to (Pt #1) that (Pt #1) was considered high risk at 25 weeks and (receiving facility) was the best hospital for high risk pregnancy. I asked if (Pt #1) was having any pain and (Pt #1) said no. I did not get a name, birthday or any other information.""  E #4 confirmed Pt #1 did not receive a MSE.

Based on review of Medical Staff By-laws, emergency room    (ER) policy and procedure review and interview it was determined the Facility failed to designate who was qualified to conduct a medical screening exam and failed to perform a medical screening exam for Patient #22.  Failure to designate  who  was qualified to perform medical screening exams did not ensure the patients presenting to the emergency room     (ER) were afforded assessment and care rendered based upon that assessment, by individuals qualified and vetted through the Facility Medical Staff By-laws.  The failed practice affected all patients who presented to the emergency room   .  Findings follow:

A. Review of the Medical Staff By-laws received from the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) at 1300 on 11/13/13 revealed no designation of who was qualified to conduct a medical screening exam.

B. Review of the emergency room    Policy and Procedure Manual received from the CNO at 1300 on 11/13/13 revealed no policy and procedure that defined who was qualified to perform a medical screening exam.

RN #2 stated Patient #22 came in between 10 PM (post meridian) and 2 am (ante meridian) on the 26th of October.  RN #2 stated it was Diversity Week-end and he remembered it well. RN #2 stated he told the couple she needed an ultrasound and this facility did not have an ultrasound to check the patient with. RN #2 stated he told the couple the closest facility with ultrasound capability was Berryville, some 20 minutes East. RN #2 was asked if he had the couple complete the Rapid ER  (emergency room   ) Information Sheet and he stated no.  RN #2 was asked if he brought Patient #22 back to an exam room and/or checked vital signs and he stated he did not bring Patient #22 back from the waiting room to an exam room or check her vital signs. RN #2 stated at least twice during the interview that he was trying to save the couple money. RN #2 stated he offered to call an ambulance and have Patient #22 transported by ambulance but husband declined stating he was driving.  RN #2 stated he cautioned husband to drive slow since he was unfamiliar with the area.  RN #2 stated he gave Patient #22 a towel and pad to protect her car seat.  RN #2 was asked if he sent any paperwork with Patient #22 to the other facility and he stated no. RN #2 stated he called the Berryville ED and told a nurse Patient #22 was en route.  RN #2 was asked if he called the ED physician and reported to him Patient #22's chief complaint and he stated yes, after Patient #22 left for the other facility.  

D. During an interview with the CNO at 0815 on 11/14/13 she verified there was nothing in the Medical Staff By-laws regarding who was designated as a qualified medical person.

The male gets back into the vehicle and drives off.  The nurse then walks back into the hospital with the wheel chair.
Further review of the form revealed the incident was reported anonymously by a staff member.
Review of the description of the incident revealed the following:  S4ED Director was notified of an anonymous incident report about an unidentified patient that needed to be investigated.  The incident was entered as an Employee Behavior event.  In the details section, it included that an unidentified nurse was being rude to an unidentified pregnant patient and told them that the patient needed to be seen at another hospital.  We began an investigation to determine who the subject patient and staff were so that we could then substantiate the claim.  The employee was identified and an investigation was immediately commenced.  S4ED Director interviewed staff, security, and the nurse that was assigned to triage.  Security was notified and the video surveillance was obtained.  Upon video review, it was observed that the nurse went out to the ED dock and had a conversation with the patient and husband at the car.  Shortly after, the patient left and the triage nurse returned inside.  Also on video, S7HIM, an employee was recognized and questioned on what she witnessed.  S7HIM stated that she heard the triage nurse ask the patient if they thought they would be able to make it to Hospital ""A"" because we do not deliver babies.  She also stated that she could not hear their responses but the car then left.  S6RN was placed on suspension until the investigation was completed.  After consulting with HR and leadership the employee returned to work and written documentation of the incident was placed in the employee file and counseling was performed.  

Review of the investigation conducted by S4ED Director revealed S6RN was interviewed by S4ED Director on 07/18/17 at 9:00 a.m.  The documentation of the interview revealed S6RN was upset they ran off and they shouldn't have left.

The documentation revealed S6RN stated she could not remember what they looked like and said the guy was anxious. 
Review of the interview conducted by S4ED Director and S7HIM revealed the patient's significant other came into the ED looking for a wheel chair.  S7HIM indicated she was waiting to check in with S8PA who was helping another patient.  S7HIM indicated she got a wheel chair and the nurse soon followed.  S7HIM stated, ""Lady was pregnant with pains.""  S7HIM stated the nurse was walking with her and said, ""She can't come here.  She needs to come to Hospital A.""  S7HIM said the nurse went out to the car and said, ""We don't deliver babies.  Do you think you are okay to go to Hospital ""A"" so that there isn't a delay of care.""

Review of the interview conducted by S3DON with S6RN dated 07/21/17 at 9:00 a.m., revealed in part the following:  When asked if she went outside to speak to the patient her immediate response was no.  I then advised her that was false information because I had reviewed the videos of that day and I indeed saw her go outside and speak with the alleged patient.  She appeared shocked and adamant about not having gone outside.  I advised S6RN we would review the video together.  When S6RN saw herself on video she became emotional in the sense that it scared her because she did not have recollection of the event.  She did not deny that it was in fact her speaking to the patient on the back dock.  S6RN was counseled on EMTALA violations and was advised that under no circumstances should we ever suggest a patient going to another facility without a medical screening exam.  She verbalized that understanding.


On 08/08/17 at 8:00 a.m., an observation of the recorded video of the ED dock and waiting room on 07/11/17 was conducted with S4ED Director and S5QD.  Review of the saved video recording revealed the following:

The male with the red shirt follows her and then is seen pacing in the ED waiting area.
At 12:48 p.m., the male in the red shirt was observed to take a wheel chair from someone not visible as they bring it through the ED doors.  S7HIM was observed to walk to the ED exit door and S6RN was observed walking behind her.  S7HIM stops in the doorway, S6RN walks outside.
At 12:48:39 p.m. the male in the red shirt was observed to push wheel chair to passenger side of the blue car and open the car door.  S6RN was observed to approach the open car door, stand on the outside of the open car door and talk to the patient and the male in the red shirt.  S7HIM was observed to walk back inside. S6RN continues to talk with patient and male in red shirt.
The male in the red shirt is observed to lean into the car, talking to the passenger.  He then pushes the wheel chair away from the car.  S7HIM was observed to walk outside and stood near the open door on the passenger side, looking at the car.  At this time S6RN was observed looking in the car.
At 12:49 p.m. S6RN pushes the wheel chair away from car.  The male in the red shirt closes car door on the passenger side.  He enters driver side and backs out of ED Dock.  S7HIM was observed to remain standing on ED Dock and watch the car drive away.

In an interview on 08/08/17 at 10:40 a.m. S3DON and S4ED Director were asked if the hospital had implemented any ongoing monitoring related to the above MSE issue.  S4ED Director indicated she had done EMTALA training with the staff during orientation and annually and had also done a training last month after the above incident was discovered.  Both confirmed that as of now they have not put a monitoring system in place to ensure that this incident doesn't occur again.  

In an interview on 08/08/17 at 10:45 a.m., S3DON was asked if a determination of an EMTALA violation was made related to the above incident.

In an interview on 08/08/17 at 11:00 a.m., S3DON, S4ED Director, and S5QD confirmed they had been unable to find a policy and procedure related to the emergency department's physician on-call procedure.  S5QD confirmed there was no policy related to how the hospital would respond to situations in which a particular specialty was not available or the on-call physician cannot respond because of circumstances beyond his control.  They confirmed they did not have a policy that addressed on-call physicians permitted to schedule elective surgery during the time they are on-call.  S4ED Director stated when a physician in the ED determines an on-call service is needed, the physician calls the operator and asks the operator to contact the physician who is on-call.  S3DON indicated the hospital had interns and residents on-call along with staff physicians.

Based on record reviews, review of video recording, and staff interviews, the hospital failed to ensure a medical screening examination was provided to each patient presenting to the ED to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.  There was no documented evidence that a medical screening examination was provided to Patient #R1 who was pregnant and presented to the hospital for treatment and left the ED after being informed by the staff that the hospital did not deliver babies.  This deficient practice was evident for 1of 1 (#R1) random patients reviewed out of a total sample of 20 patients.
 
Findings:

Review of the hospital policy titled, Medical Screening-Emergency Department, Policy Number M-1-01, dated April 2016 revealed in part the following:  The hospital shall provide a Medical Screening Examination for every person who comes to the ED making a request for examination and treatment.  Further review of the policy revealed:  Pregnant patients with a non-pregnancy related condition or who are victims of trauma shall be evaluated in the ED in consultation with the patient's OB/GYN primary care provider, if needed.  If it is determined that the individual has an Emergency Medical Condition, hospital shall provide such further medical examination and treatment necessary to stabilize the medical condition within the capability of the hospital, or to arrange for transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA) and the procedures set forth in the transfer policy.

Review of the hospital policy titled Triage and reassessment of the ED patient, Policy Number T-2-01 revealed all patients presenting to the ED will be triaged and classified to ensure that patients received appropriate medical intervention, in order of priority based upon acuity utilizing the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Five Level System.

Review of the hospital policy titled Admission, Discharge and Transfer Guidelines for the Emergency Department, Policy Number M-1-02 revealed all patients presenting for treatment will receive a medical screening examination by a physician or licensed independent practitioner (LIP).

No policy related to the on-call procedures for the emergency department was provided for review during the survey.  

During the entrance conference on 08/07/17 at 10:30 a.m., S1CNO stated the hospital did not provide OB services, neurosurgical services, or interventional cardiology services.  During the entrance conference the hospital's on-call physician policy related to the ED was requested for review.    

Review of the hospital's electronic employee incident report dated 07/12/17 at 2:00 p.m., revealed the following:
""File Owner:  Anonymous
Incident Severity:  Category A capacity to cause event/error
Just the Facts:  Patients husband brought her to the ER  where patients husband tried to check her in to be seen for vaginal bleeding while currently 36 weeks pregnant.  ER  Nurse was very rude to patient and stated ""We cannot help you here.  We do not deal with babies.  If you want to be seen you need to bring her to Hospital ""A.""  Patient continued to plead with ER  nurse to help his wife but employee still refused.  Eventually patients wife drove off with her in the car.  I was only an observer of this incident.  I witnessed the patient crying in her car and witnessed the ER  nurse refusing a patient of being seen in the [Hospital] ER.""

Review of the hospital's investigation and HSS-HO-41 form Hospital Abuse/Neglect Initial Report revealed the following:  The incident occurred on 07/11/17 at 2:45 p.m. and was discovered on 07/18/17 at 3:30 p.m.  Review of the video surveillance review revealed the following:  At 2:44 p.m. a blue car pulled up to the ED dock and a male got out of the driver's door and entered the ED.  Less than 3 minutes later, the male exits the ED and walks back to the vehicle with a wheel chair.  A nurse (S6RN) follows the male and is seen speaking to the patient and driver for 2 minutes.  The male gets back into the vehicle and drives off.  The nurse then walks back into the hospital with the wheel chair.
Further review of the form revealed the incident was reported anonymously by a staff member.
Review of the description of the incident revealed the following:  S4ED Director was notified of an anonymous incident report about an unidentified patient that needed to be investigated.  The incident was entered as an Employee Behavior event.  In the details section, it included that an unidentified nurse was being rude to an unidentified pregnant patient and told them that the patient needed to be seen at another hospital.  We began an investigation to determine who the subject patient and staff were so that we could then substantiate the claim.  The employee was identified and an investigation was immediately commenced.  S4ED Director interviewed staff, security, and the nurse that was assigned to triage.  Security was notified and the video surveillance was obtained.  Upon video review, it was observed that the nurse went out to the ED dock and had a conversation with the patient and husband at the car.  Shortly after, the patient left and the triage nurse returned inside.  Also on video, S7HIM, an employee was recognized and questioned on what she witnessed.  S7HIM stated that she heard the triage nurse ask the patient if they thought they would be able to make it to Hospital ""A"" because we do not deliver babies.  She also stated that she could not hear their responses but the car then left.  S6RN was placed on suspension until the investigation was completed.  After consulting with HR and leadership the employee returned to work and written documentation of the incident was placed in the employee file and counseling was performed.  

Review of the investigation conducted by S4ED Director revealed S6RN was interviewed by S4ED Director on 07/18/17 at 9:00 a.m.  The documentation of the interview revealed S6RN was upset they ran off and they shouldn't have left.  The documentation revealed S6RN said she told them, ""Next time you should consider because of the delay.  I didn't want them to leave.  I was just telling them for next time.""  The documentation revealed S6RN stated she could not remember what they looked like and said the guy was anxious. 
Review of the interview conducted by S4ED Director and S7HIM revealed the patient's significant other came into the ED looking for a wheel chair.  S7HIM indicated she was waiting to check in with S8PA who was helping another patient.  S7HIM indicated she got a wheel chair and the nurse soon followed.  S7HIM stated, ""Lady was pregnant with pains.""  S7HIM stated the nurse was walking with her and said, ""She can't come here.  She needs to come to Hospital A.""  S7HIM said the nurse went out to the car and said, ""We don't deliver babies.  Do you think you are okay to go to Hospital ""A"" so that there isn't a delay of care.""  S7HIM stated she could not hear what the patient said in return.  S7HIM stated the nurse was not ugly or rude and stated the patient's husband was very hesitant.

When S6RN saw herself on video she became emotional in the sense that it scared her because she did not have recollection of the event.  She did not deny that it was in fact her speaking to the patient on the back dock.  S6RN was counseled on EMTALA violations and was advised that under no circumstances should we ever suggest a patient going to another facility without a medical screening exam.  She verbalized that understanding.

 Based on interview, medical record and document review, the Emergency Department (ED) failed to restrict the transfer of 1 of 25 sampled patients (Patient 1) when it had the capacity and capability to first stabilize and treat:

- A stable airway was not established for Patient 1 on arrival to the ED, i.e. intubation (placing a breathing tube into the throat to assist breathing), ,
- Around-the-clock in-house services such as specialty providers to assist as needed for intubation, Operating Room to deliver an infant, and an adult ICU were not used to treat and stabilize; and
- Patient 1 was transferred to another hospital with an unstable airway and required immediate intubation upon arrival.

The failure to continuously assess and treat, and stabilize before transfer, resulted in delay of treatment and stabilization of an EMC. 

Findings:

Review of the ED electronic medical record (EMR), dated 10/19/19, reflected the following timeline:

At 5:28 p.m. Patient 1 arrived at the ED.

At 5:36 p.m., upon admission, Patient 1 had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 7 (GCS, a scale used to report a person's level of consciousness with less than 8 being severe impairment) and was receiving oxygen by a non-rebreather mask (high concentration of oxygen) while Medical Doctor (MD) 4 ordered a chest x-ray, laboratory tests, and medication, but no arterial blood gas (laboratory test used to determine oxygen exchange in the lungs). The chest x-ray results noted a mild collapse of a lung. Lab results included a high lactic acid level (acid build up in the body due to a lack of oxygen, which may indicate severe infection) of 14.8 millimoles per liter (normal range, 0.5-1 mmol/L), an elevated white blood cell count (part of the body's immune system) of 32,000 per microliter (normal range, 4,300 - 10.800 per microliter, also a possible indicator of infection). There was protein detected in the urine at a level above 500 milligrams per deciliter (normal range, 0-14 mg/dl) which could have indicated the development of preeclampia (high blood pressure and salt in the urine, a medical complication of pregnancy).

A 5:39 p.m. nursing progress note reflected a head-to toe-assessment of Patient 1 completed by Registered Nurse 1 (RN 1). An Emergency Severity Index level of  ""1"" (ESI, five level ED patient categorization based on illness severity and resource needs with ""1"" indicating the most urgent patients) was assigned. Patient 1's vital signs included a blood pressure of 174/108 millimeters of mercury (normal average  blood pressure 120/ 80 mm Hg), heart rate of 173 beats per minute (normal range is 60-100 BPM), respirations of 32 per minute (normal is 10 - 18 per minute), and temperature of 101.3 (normal body temperatures is 98.6 F).  The assessment indicated Patient 1 was receiving oxygen through a face mask at 100% (maximum amount of oxygen). A Foley catheter (tube that collects urine from the bladder) was inserted by the nurse. Patient 1 was intermittently agitated, combative, non-verbal, lethargic, stuporous (sluggish, sleepy and confused), vomiting, snoring, incontinent (unable to control bladder), skin hot, flushed and clammy.  Precautions were taken for seizures and aspiration (swallowing vomit into the lungs). Patient 1's labor status was not documented.

Starting at 5:45 p.m. through 7:22 p.m., the Medication Administration Record (MAR) indicated Patient 1 received the sedative lorazepam (Ativan) intravenously (IV, through a tube into a vein) multiple times.

The chart reflected vital signs recorded by RN 1.  The form reflected that MD 2 certified he examined and explained to the risks and benefits of being transferred to Patient 1. No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:37 p.m., the chart reflected a diagnosis entry by MD 2, Patient 1 diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

At 6:47 p.m. the chart reflected a note filed and signed by RN 1:  Patient eight months pregnant, Russian speaking, postictal (confusion and sleepy after a seizure) on arrival, swollen tongue, incontinent, sonorous respirations, pitting edema (very swollen legs), emesis (vomit) on face and shirt, febrile.

The initial vital signs taken during transfer reflected in the chart were a  blood pressure 148/80 mm Hg, heart rate 157, respiratory rate 30, temperature 103.9, oxygen 96% on 15 liters of oxygen via face mask (maximum oxygen deliverable by face mask), and GCS score of 7.

A review of the accepting hospital's transfer timeline, dated 10/19/19 at 7:58 p.m., indicated, ""Call back to [nurse], asked to hold transport as bed is not ready until 8:30 p.m., [accepting facility] needs to move patient. Advised transport has already left with patient"".  The chart also reflected the accepting physician was OB and not an ICU physician. 

At 8:08 p.m., Patient 1 arrived at the accepting hospital directly to the ICU.  There was no available bed for the patient.

1)  During an interview with the Assistant Medical Group Administrator (AMGA), on 3/3/2020 at 9:36 a.m., she stated ""Anesthesia can intubate and is available 24/7, and ER  MDs can intubate 24/7.""  She further stated, ""There is a difficult airway kit available.""  She further stated if a pregnant patient needs to deliver and delivery is imminent (near approaching) or the patient has delivered, the sister facility will send a team to the ED.  She stated their hospital can do emergency Caesarean sections in the Operating Room (OR).  The ED has an obstetrician (OB, a physician who provides medical care to pregnant patients) consultant available to the ED. The transport team includes: NICU team, and there is a delivery team in the ED.  

During a concurrent interview with the Emergency Department Manager (EDM) and a review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/2020 at 10:12 a.m., she stated when a pregnant patient needs care in the ED, an OB will be called from two other sister facilities, one across the street and another 30 minutes away.  EDM explained that the ED doctor will communicate with OB, and the OB will come to the ED.

During a concurrent interview with the Assistant Physician-in-Charge (APIC) and EDM and a review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/2020 at 11:22 a.m., APIC referred to RN 1's nursing note at 6:47 p.m. which indicated ""No fetal heart tones or heart beat noted on bedside ultrasound"".  APIC stated the patient was critically ill with fetal demise, and ""The baby needed to be delivered to treat [eclampsia]"".  APIC acknowledged the ED had the capacity and capability to admit and care for Patient 1 and deliver the fetus (unborn infant). APIC stated, ""We can deliver [the baby] and place her [Patient 1] in the ICU, if she [Patient 1] had lost the baby already.""  She further stated, the hospital could treat the high lactic acid level and call the on-call OB team to care for the patient.  APIC stated, at 7:26 p.m., the chart indicated Patient 1's heart rate was 163 beats per minute normal range is 60 to 100 BPM), temperature 101.5 (normal range, 98.6), respiratory rate 36 (normal range, 12 to 20), and she was septic.

During a concurrent interview with Emergency Department Physician Director (EDPD) and APIC and review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/20 at 3:10 p.m., MDPD  stated a ""Delivery Alert"" is called for pregnant patients greater than 27 weeks pregnant.  EDPD stated, ""Focus on the mother first, stabilize her, then the fetus.""  ""When you call OB, you need info.  So, [perform a] fetus ultrasound.""  He stated he will look for fetal heart tones, movement, pelvic exam, as possible pending delivery.  He states that a delivery alert includes: overhead call, team and in-house staff.  EDPD explained emergency room    doctors know ""even before vital signs, know if [the patient] is in extremis"", and know the priority is resuscitation - airway, breathing, and circulation.  EDPD explained that ED physicians will consult with OB on the phone to receive advice for stabilization.  He stated the ED will stabilize patients always, and if there is distress or difficulty transferring the patient, the hospital will keep the patient without exception and will send to the patient to the sister facility. He further stated, when the NICU and OB get called, they get to the hospital right away. He again stated ""Airway and breathing"" come first with stabilization. He stated the rule of thumb is to intubate when the patient has a GCS of 8.  When he was asked if he would intubate a patient with a GCS of 7 and a lactic acid of 14, he stated ""Yes"".  

During a concurrent interview with MD 2 and review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/20 at 3:44 p.m., MD 2 confirmed his only note for Patient 1 was completed at 11:54 p.m. because he ""busy taking care"" of Patient 1.  MD 2 stated he was at the bedside and completed a fetal ultrasound and pelvic exam on Patient 1.  MD 2 stated the fetal ultrasound showed, ""Low fluid, no heartbeat, no activity"". MD 2 stated Patient 1 was given lorazepam in the ED twice for questionable seizure activity, but she was not having constant seizures. Additional doses of lorazepam were given after 6 p.m. were for delirium and agitation.  MD 5 acknowledged lorazepam can potentially affect respirations of Patient 1. The chart reflected that Patient 1 was not intubated on arrival to at 5:36 p.m.  When MD 2 was asked why Patient 1 was not intubated on admission or during the stay in the ED, he stated Patient 1 was critical and one of the ""sickest"" of patients and ""required resuscitation"".  MD 2 further stated he was skilled at intubating patients and could intubate within 2 to 3 minutes. MD 2 stated he cancelled the intubation at 6:23 p.m. because it would have delayed care and didn't feel it was beneficial for Patient 1.  ""We were ready to send the patient to the floor [the accepting hospital's labor and delivery unit]"".  MD 2 further stated Patient 1 was being transferred to the accepting hospital with two paramedics and RN 1.  He stated the head of the bed was up the entire transfer to help with Patient 1's breathing.  He stated the transferring paramedics could intubate Patient 1 in route if an airway was necessary. 

During a concurrent phone interview and chart review, on 10/13/2020 at 10:12 a.m. with RN 3, Director of Medical ICU. stated received multiple complaints regarding the Patient 1 critical status and stability during transfer, and the ICU was not ready not ready for the patient and the bed was not assigned yet.

During a concurrent phone interview and chart review, on 10/13/2020 at 10:46 a.m. with RN 3 and RN 4, the Interim Clinical Nurse Manager for Nursing Administration, stated she was present when Patient 1 arrived to ICU, and described Patient 1 as ""super sick"".  She further stated the ICU team had to stabilize and intubate Patient 1 on arrival, and manage multiple critical tasks at once, including the delivery of the baby, brain scans for brain injury  due to[DIAGNOSES REDACTED], labs, exam and so forth.

2)  During a concurrent interview and record review on 3/4/2020 at 11:22 a.m., with emergency room    Manager (EDM) and Assistant Physician in Charge (APIC).  APIC stated Patient 1 was not hospital members (HMO insurance holders). ""[We] would have had to bring the OB team in [to the hospital] to deliver [the fetus]"".  The hospital could deliver a baby in operating room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU), but would have preferred to have Patient 1 cared for at a sister facility.  APIC stated it would take ""less time to transport Patient 1 elsewhere than to wait for [hospital OB] team to deliver ...We can deliver and place her [Patient 1] in the ICU, if she had lost the baby already... a code-C [Cesarean Sections], bring OB team] here....We can do it here with the labor and delivery team.""  However, APIC stated Patient 1 was ""critical"" and it would ""delay care"" because it usually took 15 to 30 minutes, and sometimes up to 60 minutes to get the patient to the operating room.  Patient 1 arrived at the ED at 5:28 p.m. in ""critical"" condition and was in the ED until 7:38 p.m.  APIC stated, at 7:26 p.m. the chart reflected, Patient 1's heart rate was ""163 (normal 60 to 100), temperature 101.5 (normal 98.6), respiratory rate 36 (normal 10 to 16), and septic (life threatening body infection), [necessary to] get the baby out"".

During an interview and concurrent chart review with MDPD and APIC,  MDPD stated, NICU [neonatal intensive care team] was 15 to 30 minutes here [Facility 1] ...Delivery alert for [pregnancy] greater than 27 weeks"".  MDPD explained ED doctors will ""consult with [the on-call] OB on the phone for advice for stabilization ...always will stabilize patients... in distress or if difficulty transferring... [We] will keep patient without exception and will send to the patient [to sister facility]... transferred intubated... with medications... after vital signs are stable... when [it is] safe for the patient"". 

During a 3:44 p.m., 3/4/20 concurrent interview and record review, MD 2 stated Patient 1 needed to be transferred to another facility to control seizures and for birth. His progress note indicated Patient 1 was a ""critically ill patient"" and was ""stabilized effectively...breathing...required restraints for delirium because of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (severe high blood pressure and seizures during pregnancy), septsis (blood infection) and acidosis (increased acid levels in blood), and needed resuscitation... had GCS of 8 the whole time... sonorous (loud snoring) respiration, snoring was sign of soft tissue obstruction"".    

MD 2 stated, the ED called the accepting hospital to ""take her"" because she was ""stable"".  MD 2 stated accepting hospital, labor and delivery unit was ""taking too long"", so he called Patient 1's regular obstetrician at the accepting hospital who accepted the transfer.  MD 2 acknowledged labor and delivery would not accept Patient 1 due to the high lactate level (high blood acid levels), and instead Patient 1 needed to go to an intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and seizures.  MD 2 stated he gave an ""up to date summary of the Patient 1's status"" to accepting hospital intensive unit care (ICU) physician, and  stated he relayed  Patient 1 was ""stable"" and ""no longer seizing...stabilized...labs...updated vitals...Ativan for agitation...blood pressure controlled...breathing on own.""

MD 2 was asked why Patient 1 was not intubated on admission or during the stay at the ED.  MD 2 stated he ""didn't feel it was beneficial. It would delay care.""  MD 2 stated he cancelled the intubation at 6:23 p.m. because ""it would delay care"", and ""lose 20 minutes"", so ""didn't intubate"".  ""We were ready to send the patient to the floor [ a non ICU bed at the accepting hospital]""

MD 2 stated a note for Patient 1's transfer documentation was completed before the transfer.  MD 2 referred to the documentation on the ""Physician Assessment and Certification Patient Transfer under EMTALA/COBRA"" form completed at 6:30 p.m.  MD 2 indicated from 5:45 p.m. until transfer time at 7:38 p.m., Patient 1 was given several additional doses of lorazepam for agitation and delirium. MD 2 stated Patient 1 required restraints for delirium because of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED], sepsis and acidosis and needed resuscitation...had GCS of 8 whole time ...sonorous respiration and snoring was sign of soft tissue obstruction ... and critical"".  MD 2 continued, Patient 1 was being transferred to the accepting hospital via  ALS (Emergency Medical System, Advance Life Support ambulance) with a paramedic and RN 1, an ED employee, and ""911, EMS could intubate if needed, to and from facilities"".    

During the interview at 3:44 p.m., MD 2 was unable to locate any additional written documentation of Patient 1's exam, additional GCS scores, ultrasound (a machine that documentation and pictures, vaginal (birth canal) exam, MSE on arrival for EMC, continuous status exam, transfer note before discharge, and communication with other physicians.  MD 2 stated, his note filed and signed at 11:54 p.m. was ""incomplete"".

Review of records from accepting hospital dated 10/19/2019 and concurrent interview on 3/10/2020 at 4:36 p.m. with MD 5.  The chart indicated that MD 5 was contacted by Patient 1's obstetrician and was informed Patient 1 had a fetal demise, and Patient 1 was transferred due to insurance reasons, the elevated lactic acid level.  In addition, the records reflected the following:  MD 5, an ICU lung disease specialist at the accepting hospital, wrote an 8:08 p.m. progress note that Patients 1 was admitted     directly to an ICU.  MD 5 stated, he was informed by the Patient 1's OB physician that because of insurance reasons, Patient 1 was being transferred and Patient 1 ""might arrive"" in the ICU.  MD 5 stated the patient arrived in the ICU unexpectantly via EMS ambulance, and ""had to scramble to get ready for the patient... the nurses didn't know and had to find a bed.""  MD 5 further stated that the only knowledge he had of Patient 1 was from the accepting OB's report, history in EMR, and the husband, through a translator.  MD 5 stated the ED transferring physician did not contact him to accept the patients.  MD 5 stated ""I'm upset"" and ""I saved her life."" MD 5's note reflected Patient 1 was not stable for transfer and presented to ICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (unable to breathe on own and not getting enough oxygen), severe sepsis,[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and suspected fetal demise. The chart indicated Patient 1 was confused, agitated, not following commands, snoring, had high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, and pre-term labor (early labor) and rupture of membranes (a sign of labor). Patient 1 was intubated on arrival to the ICU.  Examination of the fetus on 10/19/19 at 9:36 p.m. reflected fetal demise via fetal heart tracing and bedside ultrasound.  The fetus was vaginally delivered in the ICU.  An MRI (detailed picture of the brain) completed on 10/21/2019 at 9:32 p.m. reflected non-specific findings which were but ""concerning for PRES [Posterior reversible [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [brain damage] syndrome, also called the acute hypertensive [high blood pressure] [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (brain damage)], hypertension in the setting of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED].""  

Review of the hospital policy titled ""Emergency Medical Screening Examination, Treatment and Transfer (EMTALA),"" effective 7/11/19, indicated the following: the hospital may not transfer any patient with an unstabilized emergency medical condition unless the patient requests the transfer or a physician certifies that the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the risks to the patient from the transfer. The hospital provided medical treatment within its capacity to minimize the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child.  Once the emergency medical condition is stabilized, the individual may be admitted     to the hospital for further care, be discharged   , or be transferred to another facility.  The transfer process:  The transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or unborn child or a physician determines the transfer is medically necessary.  Prior to transfer, the patient's condition will be reassessed just before transfer.  The medical record or transfer form # , will reflect the exam (form 3 2494, titled physician Assessment and Certification- Patient Transfer under EMTALA/Cobra).  The transferring physician will contact a physician at the receiving facility, obtain his/her agreement to accept the transfer, and document the receiving physician's acceptance on the transfer form (Physician Assessment and Certification-Patient Transfer under EMTALA/COBRA).  The receiving facility will be contacted to obtain acceptance of the transfer, confirmation that the appropriate bed is available, and that appropriate medical treatment will be provided.  The transferring physician will inform the patient (or legal representative) of the reasons for the transfer, including risks and benefits of the transfer.   The physician will document the reason for the transfer, including risks and benefits, in the medical record.  The transferring physician will complete the transfer form certifying that for unstable patients, the medical benefits of receiving treatment at another facility outweigh the risks to the patient (or if pregnant, unborn child) from effecting the transfer.  

Review of the hospital's policy titled, ""Treatment and Transfer"", effective 11/13/18, indicated an emergency medical condition is ""stabilized"" when the condition is resolved. A women experiencing contractions is in true labor, unless a physician or other qualified medical person acting within his or her scope of practice as defined in the medical staff bylaw and State law, certifies that, after a reasonable time of observation the woman is in false labor. 

Review of the hospital policy titled, ""Imminent Delivery-Care of Mother and Infant"", effective 8/18/17, indicated any pregnant patient over 20 weeks gestation that presents with symptoms possibly related to labor or trauma related complaints will be triaged as emergent, which will facilitate rapid deployment of needed resources. The physician must determine preterm labor, contractions onset, duration, bag of water intact, vaginal bleeding, fetal movement, fetal heart tones (normal range is 120-160), mother's vital signs and temperature, immunizations, and signs and symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

Review of hospital policy titled, Qualified Interpreter Services for Limited English Proficient Persons, effective 11/1/19, reflected the following:  individuals who need spoken language assistance: When an interpreter encounter is complete, use of an interpreter is documented in the medical record or health plan file.  

Review of a 12/20/13 publication from CPDH and the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative titled ""Airway Management In Pregnant or Postpartum Women Having Seizures"" reflected the following: ""A seizure is a frightening and uncommon occurrence in Labor and Delivery and the visceral response of many providers is to immediately administer magnesium sulfate to stop the abnormal movement associated with the seizure. However, even more important than stopping the seizure, which usually stops on its own after 1-2 minutes, is maintaining and protecting the airway. Seizures do not directly cause death, but intracranial hemorrhage [bleeding inside the brain] and hypertensive [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [brain injury due to high blood pressure]. Therefore, the airway is the first priority in seizure management, even before administration of magnesium sulfate."" https://www.cmqcc.org/resource/airway-management-pregnant-or-postpartum-women-having-seizures-toolkit-pdf.

 Based on interview, medical record and document review, the Emergency Department (ED) failed to restrict the transfer of 1 of 25 sampled patients (Patient 1) when it had the capacity and capability to first stabilize and treat:

- A stable airway was not established for Patient 1 on arrival to the ED, i.e. intubation (placing a breathing tube into the throat to assist breathing), ,
- Around-the-clock in-house services such as specialty providers to assist as needed for intubation, Operating Room to deliver an infant, and an adult ICU were not used to treat and stabilize; and
- Patient 1 was transferred to another hospital with an unstable airway and required immediate intubation upon arrival.

The failure to continuously assess and treat, and stabilize before transfer, resulted in delay of treatment and stabilization of an EMC. 

Findings:

Review of the ED electronic medical record (EMR), dated 10/19/19, reflected the following timeline:

At 5:28 p.m. Patient 1 arrived at the ED.

At 5:36 p.m., upon admission, Patient 1 had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 7 (GCS, a scale used to report a person's level of consciousness with less than 8 being severe impairment) and was receiving oxygen by a non-rebreather mask (high concentration of oxygen) while Medical Doctor (MD) 4 ordered a chest x-ray, laboratory tests, and medication, but no arterial blood gas (laboratory test used to determine oxygen exchange in the lungs). The chest x-ray results noted a mild collapse of a lung. Lab results included a high lactic acid level (acid build up in the body due to a lack of oxygen, which may indicate severe infection) of 14.8 millimoles per liter (normal range, 0.5-1 mmol/L), an elevated white blood cell count (part of the body's immune system) of 32,000 per microliter (normal range, 4,300 - 10.800 per microliter, also a possible indicator of infection). There was protein detected in the urine at a level above 500 milligrams per deciliter (normal range, 0-14 mg/dl) which could have indicated the development of preeclampia (high blood pressure and salt in the urine, a medical complication of pregnancy).

A 5:39 p.m. nursing progress note reflected a head-to toe-assessment of Patient 1 completed by Registered Nurse 1 (RN 1). An Emergency Severity Index level of  ""1"" (ESI, five level ED patient categorization based on illness severity and resource needs with ""1"" indicating the most urgent patients) was assigned. Patient 1's vital signs included a blood pressure of 174/108 millimeters of mercury (normal average  blood pressure 120/ 80 mm Hg), heart rate of 173 beats per minute (normal range is 60-100 BPM), respirations of 32 per minute (normal is 10 - 18 per minute), and temperature of 101.3 (normal body temperatures is 98.6 F).  The assessment indicated Patient 1 was receiving oxygen through a face mask at 100% (maximum amount of oxygen). A Foley catheter (tube that collects urine from the bladder) was inserted by the nurse. Patient 1 was intermittently agitated, combative, non-verbal, lethargic, stuporous (sluggish, sleepy and confused), vomiting, snoring, incontinent (unable to control bladder), skin hot, flushed and clammy.  Precautions were taken for seizures and aspiration (swallowing vomit into the lungs). Patient 1's labor status was not documented.

Starting at 5:45 p.m. through 7:22 p.m., the Medication Administration Record (MAR) indicated Patient 1 received the sedative lorazepam (Ativan) intravenously (IV, through a tube into a vein) multiple times.

At 6:01 p.m., the restraint documentation reflected Patient 1 was placed in soft restraints until she was transferred to the accepting hospital.

At 6:15 p.m., the chart reflected MD 4's medication orders in preparation for intubation (breathing tube placed in throat to breathe).  The chart reflected that RN 1 wrote, ""Plan to intubate"". 

At 6:18 p.m., the chart reflected an entry by discharge planner registered nurse, ""MD states fetal demise [death of unborn baby] and patient needs removed stat [immediately]...[accepting hospital] labor and delivery charge [nurse] was on the phone [with MD 2]"". 

At 6:23 p.m. the chart indicated that Patient 1's intubation was cancelled.  No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:24 p.m., the chart reflected a diagnosis entry by MD 2, Patient 1 diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]"".  No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:30 p.m., indicated MD 2 completed an English version of the ""Physician Assessment and Certification Patient Transfer under EMTALA/COBRA"" form for Patient 1: Diagnosis ""antepartum[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [severe high blood pressure and seizures occurring not long before childbirth]"", condition was marked ""Stable"" and reason for transfer was ""higher level of care, additional time delay in receiving treatment, deterioration of medical condition"". The chart reflected vital signs recorded by RN 1.  The form reflected that MD 2 certified he examined and explained to the risks and benefits of being transferred to Patient 1. No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:37 p.m., the chart reflected a diagnosis entry by MD 2, Patient 1 diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

At 6:47 p.m. the chart reflected a note filed and signed by RN 1:  Patient eight months pregnant, Russian speaking, postictal (confusion and sleepy after a seizure) on arrival, swollen tongue, incontinent, sonorous respirations, pitting edema (very swollen legs), emesis (vomit) on face and shirt, febrile.  No fetal heart tones noted on bedside ultrasound (pregnant women imaging of an unborn infant). MD on phone with accepting hospital and Patient 1 to be transported emergently to accepting hospital.  No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:52 p.m. the chart reflected Patient 1's heart rate was 156 and respiratory rate was 39. No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 6:56 p.m., the chart reflected a filed (entered) and signed by RN 1, ""L&D [Labor and Delivery at accepting hospital], reports unable to take patient due to lactic elevated.  Pending bed placement at [accepting hospital].""  

At 7:09 p.m., a note by RN 1 read, ""Pending ICU [Intensive Care Unit] bed at [accepting hospital]"". The chart indicated RN 1 gave report to an ICU RN at the accepting hospital. 

At 7:26 p.m. the chart reflected, Patient 1's vital signs were heart rate 163, temperature 101.5, and respiratory rate 36. No MD assessment of Patient 1 was documented in the EMR at this time.  

At 7:38 p.m., Emergency Medical System Advance Life Support (also known as EMS  ALS, transport of critical patient and a paramedic is required) records reflected Patient 1 was accompanied by RN 1 and a paramedic, and was transported to accepting hospital via EMS ALS with light and sirens.  The initial vital signs taken during transfer reflected in the chart were a  blood pressure 148/80 mm Hg, heart rate 157, respiratory rate 30, temperature 103.9, oxygen 96% on 15 liters of oxygen via face mask (maximum oxygen deliverable by face mask), and GCS score of 7.

A review of the accepting hospital's transfer timeline, dated 10/19/19 at 7:58 p.m., indicated, ""Call back to [nurse], asked to hold transport as bed is not ready until 8:30 p.m., [accepting facility] needs to move patient. Advised transport has already left with patient"".  The chart also reflected the accepting physician was OB and not an ICU physician. 

At 8:08 p.m., Patient 1 arrived at the accepting hospital directly to the ICU.  There was no available bed for the patient.

1)  During an interview with the Assistant Medical Group Administrator (AMGA), on 3/3/2020 at 9:36 a.m., she stated ""Anesthesia can intubate and is available 24/7, and ER  MDs can intubate 24/7.""  She further stated, ""There is a difficult airway kit available.""  She further stated if a pregnant patient needs to deliver and delivery is imminent (near approaching) or the patient has delivered, the sister facility will send a team to the ED.  She stated their hospital can do emergency Caesarean sections in the Operating Room (OR).  The ED has an obstetrician (OB, a physician who provides medical care to pregnant patients) consultant available to the ED. The transport team includes: NICU team, and there is a delivery team in the ED.  

During a concurrent interview with the Emergency Department Manager (EDM) and a review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/2020 at 10:12 a.m., she stated when a pregnant patient needs care in the ED, an OB will be called from two other sister facilities, one across the street and another 30 minutes away.  EDM explained that the ED doctor will communicate with OB, and the OB will come to the ED.

During a concurrent interview with the Assistant Physician-in-Charge (APIC) and EDM and a review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/2020 at 11:22 a.m., APIC referred to RN 1's nursing note at 6:47 p.m. which indicated ""No fetal heart tones or heart beat noted on bedside ultrasound"".  APIC stated the patient was critically ill with fetal demise, and ""The baby needed to be delivered to treat [eclampsia]"".  APIC acknowledged the ED had the capacity and capability to admit and care for Patient 1 and deliver the fetus (unborn infant). APIC stated, ""We can deliver [the baby] and place her [Patient 1] in the ICU, if she [Patient 1] had lost the baby already.""  She further stated, the hospital could treat the high lactic acid level and call the on-call OB team to care for the patient.  APIC stated, at 7:26 p.m., the chart indicated Patient 1's heart rate was 163 beats per minute normal range is 60 to 100 BPM), temperature 101.5 (normal range, 98.6), respiratory rate 36 (normal range, 12 to 20), and she was septic.

During a concurrent interview with Emergency Department Physician Director (EDPD) and APIC and review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/20 at 3:10 p.m., MDPD  stated a ""Delivery Alert"" is called for pregnant patients greater than 27 weeks pregnant.  EDPD stated, ""Focus on the mother first, stabilize her, then the fetus.""  ""When you call OB, you need info.  So, [perform a] fetus ultrasound.""  He stated he will look for fetal heart tones, movement, pelvic exam, as possible pending delivery.  He states that a delivery alert includes: overhead call, team and in-house staff.  EDPD explained emergency room    doctors know ""even before vital signs, know if [the patient] is in extremis"", and know the priority is resuscitation - airway, breathing, and circulation.  EDPD explained that ED physicians will consult with OB on the phone to receive advice for stabilization.  He stated the ED will stabilize patients always, and if there is distress or difficulty transferring the patient, the hospital will keep the patient without exception and will send to the patient to the sister facility. He further stated, when the NICU and OB get called, they get to the hospital right away. He again stated ""Airway and breathing"" come first with stabilization. He stated the rule of thumb is to intubate when the patient has a GCS of 8.  When he was asked if he would intubate a patient with a GCS of 7 and a lactic acid of 14, he stated ""Yes"".  

During a concurrent interview with MD 2 and review of Patient 1's EMR on 3/4/20 at 3:44 p.m., MD 2 confirmed his only note for Patient 1 was completed at 11:54 p.m. because he ""busy taking care"" of Patient 1.  MD 2 stated he was at the bedside and completed a fetal ultrasound and pelvic exam on Patient 1.  MD 2 stated the fetal ultrasound showed, ""Low fluid, no heartbeat, no activity"". MD 2 stated Patient 1 was given lorazepam in the ED twice for questionable seizure activity, but she was not having constant seizures. Additional doses of lorazepam were given after 6 p.m. were for delirium and agitation.  MD 5 acknowledged lorazepam can potentially affect respirations of Patient 1. The chart reflected that Patient 1 was not intubated on arrival to at 5:36 p.m.  When MD 2 was asked why Patient 1 was not intubated on admission or during the stay in the ED, he stated Patient 1 was critical and one of the ""sickest"" of patients and ""required resuscitation"".  MD 2 further stated he was skilled at intubating patients and could intubate within 2 to 3 minutes. MD 2 stated he cancelled the intubation at 6:23 p.m. because it would have delayed care and didn't feel it was beneficial for Patient 1.  ""We were ready to send the patient to the floor [the accepting hospital's labor and delivery unit]"".  MD 2 further stated Patient 1 was being transferred to the accepting hospital with two paramedics and RN 1.  He stated the head of the bed was up the entire transfer to help with Patient 1's breathing.  He stated the transferring paramedics could intubate Patient 1 in route if an airway was necessary. 

During a concurrent phone interview and chart review, on 10/13/2020 at 10:12 a.m. with RN 3, Director of Medical ICU. stated received multiple complaints regarding the Patient 1 critical status and stability during transfer, and the ICU was not ready not ready for the patient and the bed was not assigned yet.

During a concurrent phone interview and chart review, on 10/13/2020 at 10:46 a.m. with RN 3 and RN 4, the Interim Clinical Nurse Manager for Nursing Administration, stated she was present when Patient 1 arrived to ICU, and described Patient 1 as ""super sick"".  She further stated the ICU team had to stabilize and intubate Patient 1 on arrival, and manage multiple critical tasks at once, including the delivery of the baby, brain scans for brain injury  due to[DIAGNOSES REDACTED], labs, exam and so forth.

2)  During a concurrent interview and record review on 3/4/2020 at 11:22 a.m., with emergency room    Manager (EDM) and Assistant Physician in Charge (APIC).  APIC stated Patient 1 was not hospital members (HMO insurance holders). ""[We] would have had to bring the OB team in [to the hospital] to deliver [the fetus]"".  The hospital could deliver a baby in operating room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU), but would have preferred to have Patient 1 cared for at a sister facility.  APIC stated it would take ""less time to transport Patient 1 elsewhere than to wait for [hospital OB] team to deliver ...We can deliver and place her [Patient 1] in the ICU, if she had lost the baby already... a code-C [Cesarean Sections], bring OB team] here....We can do it here with the labor and delivery team.""  However, APIC stated Patient 1 was ""critical"" and it would ""delay care"" because it usually took 15 to 30 minutes, and sometimes up to 60 minutes to get the patient to the operating room.  Patient 1 arrived at the ED at 5:28 p.m. in ""critical"" condition and was in the ED until 7:38 p.m.  APIC stated, at 7:26 p.m. the chart reflected, Patient 1's heart rate was ""163 (normal 60 to 100), temperature 101.5 (normal 98.6), respiratory rate 36 (normal 10 to 16), and septic (life threatening body infection), [necessary to] get the baby out"".

During an interview and concurrent chart review with MDPD and APIC,  MDPD stated, NICU [neonatal intensive care team] was 15 to 30 minutes here [Facility 1] ...Delivery alert for [pregnancy] greater than 27 weeks"".  MDPD explained ED doctors will ""consult with [the on-call] OB on the phone for advice for stabilization ...always will stabilize patients... in distress or if difficulty transferring... [We] will keep patient without exception and will send to the patient [to sister facility]... transferred intubated... with medications... after vital signs are stable... when [it is] safe for the patient"". 

During a 3:44 p.m., 3/4/20 concurrent interview and record review, MD 2 stated Patient 1 needed to be transferred to another facility to control seizures and for birth. His progress note indicated Patient 1 was a ""critically ill patient"" and was ""stabilized effectively...breathing...required restraints for delirium because of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (severe high blood pressure and seizures during pregnancy), septsis (blood infection) and acidosis (increased acid levels in blood), and needed resuscitation... had GCS of 8 the whole time... sonorous (loud snoring) respiration, snoring was sign of soft tissue obstruction"".    

MD 2 stated, the ED called the accepting hospital to ""take her"" because she was ""stable"".  MD 2 stated accepting hospital, labor and delivery unit was ""taking too long"", so he called Patient 1's regular obstetrician at the accepting hospital who accepted the transfer.  MD 2 acknowledged labor and delivery would not accept Patient 1 due to the high lactate level (high blood acid levels), and instead Patient 1 needed to go to an intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and seizures.  MD 2 stated he gave an ""up to date summary of the Patient 1's status"" to accepting hospital intensive unit care (ICU) physician, and  stated he relayed  Patient 1 was ""stable"" and ""no longer seizing...stabilized...labs...updated vitals...Ativan for agitation...blood pressure controlled...breathing on own.""

MD 2 was asked why Patient 1 was not intubated on admission or during the stay at the ED.  MD 2 stated he ""didn't feel it was beneficial. It would delay care.""  MD 2 stated he cancelled the intubation at 6:23 p.m. because ""it would delay care"", and ""lose 20 minutes"", so ""didn't intubate"".  ""We were ready to send the patient to the floor [ a non ICU bed at the accepting hospital]""

MD 2 stated a note for Patient 1's transfer documentation was completed before the transfer.  MD 2 referred to the documentation on the ""Physician Assessment and Certification Patient Transfer under EMTALA/COBRA"" form completed at 6:30 p.m.  MD 2 indicated from 5:45 p.m. until transfer time at 7:38 p.m., Patient 1 was given several additional doses of lorazepam for agitation and delirium. MD 2 stated Patient 1 required restraints for delirium because of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED], sepsis and acidosis and needed resuscitation...had GCS of 8 whole time ...sonorous respiration and snoring was sign of soft tissue obstruction ... and critical"".  MD 2 continued, Patient 1 was being transferred to the accepting hospital via  ALS (Emergency Medical System, Advance Life Support ambulance) with a paramedic and RN 1, an ED employee, and ""911, EMS could intubate if needed, to and from facilities"".    

During the interview at 3:44 p.m., MD 2 was unable to locate any additional written documentation of Patient 1's exam, additional GCS scores, ultrasound (a machine that documentation and pictures, vaginal (birth canal) exam, MSE on arrival for EMC, continuous status exam, transfer note before discharge, and communication with other physicians.  MD 2 stated, his note filed and signed at 11:54 p.m. was ""incomplete"".

Review of records from accepting hospital dated 10/19/2019 and concurrent interview on 3/10/2020 at 4:36 p.m. with MD 5.  The chart indicated that MD 5 was contacted by Patient 1's obstetrician and was informed Patient 1 had a fetal demise, and Patient 1 was transferred due to insurance reasons, the elevated lactic acid level.  In addition, the records reflected the following:  MD 5, an ICU lung disease specialist at the accepting hospital, wrote an 8:08 p.m. progress note that Patients 1 was admitted     directly to an ICU.  MD 5 stated, he was informed by the Patient 1's OB physician that because of insurance reasons, Patient 1 was being transferred and Patient 1 ""might arrive"" in the ICU.  MD 5 stated the patient arrived in the ICU unexpectantly via EMS ambulance, and ""had to scramble to get ready for the patient... the nurses didn't know and had to find a bed.""  MD 5 further stated that the only knowledge he had of Patient 1 was from the accepting OB's report, history in EMR, and the husband, through a translator.  MD 5 stated the ED transferring physician did not contact him to accept the patients.  MD 5 stated ""I'm upset"" and ""I saved her life."" MD 5's note reflected Patient 1 was not stable for transfer and presented to ICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (unable to breathe on own and not getting enough oxygen), severe sepsis,[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and suspected fetal demise. The chart indicated Patient 1 was confused, agitated, not following commands, snoring, had high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, and pre-term labor (early labor) and rupture of membranes (a sign of labor). Patient 1 was intubated on arrival to the ICU.  Examination of the fetus on 10/19/19 at 9:36 p.m. reflected fetal demise via fetal heart tracing and bedside ultrasound.  The fetus was vaginally delivered in the ICU.  An MRI (detailed picture of the brain) completed on 10/21/2019 at 9:32 p.m. reflected non-specific findings which were but ""concerning for PRES [Posterior reversible [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [brain damage] syndrome, also called the acute hypertensive [high blood pressure] [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (brain damage)], hypertension in the setting of[DIAGNOSES REDACTED].""  

Review of the hospital policy titled ""Emergency Medical Screening Examination, Treatment and Transfer (EMTALA),"" effective 7/11/19, indicated the following: the hospital may not transfer any patient with an unstabilized emergency medical condition unless the patient requests the transfer or a physician certifies that the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the risks to the patient from the transfer. The hospital provided medical treatment within its capacity to minimize the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child.  Once the emergency medical condition is stabilized, the individual may be admitted     to the hospital for further care, be discharged   , or be transferred to another facility.  The transfer process:  The transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or unborn child or a physician determines the transfer is medically necessary.  Prior to transfer, the patient's condition will be reassessed just before transfer.  The medical record or transfer form # , will reflect the exam (form 3 2494, titled physician Assessment and Certification- Patient Transfer under EMTALA/Cobra).  The transferring physician will contact a physician at the receiving facility, obtain his/her agreement to accept the transfer, and document the receiving physician's acceptance on the transfer form (Physician Assessment and Certification-Patient Transfer under EMTALA/COBRA).  The receiving facility will be contacted to obtain acceptance of the transfer, confirmation that the appropriate bed is available, and that appropriate medical treatment will be provided.  The transferring physician will inform the patient (or legal representative) of the reasons for the transfer, including risks and benefits of the transfer.   The physician will document the reason for the transfer, including risks and benefits, in the medical record.  The transferring physician will complete the transfer form certifying that for unstable patients, the medical benefits of receiving treatment at another facility outweigh the risks to the patient (or if pregnant, unborn child) from effecting the transfer.  

Review of the hospital's policy titled, ""Treatment and Transfer"", effective 11/13/18, indicated an emergency medical condition is ""stabilized"" when the condition is resolved. A women experiencing contractions is in true labor, unless a physician or other qualified medical person acting within his or her scope of practice as defined in the medical staff bylaw and State law, certifies that, after a reasonable time of observation the woman is in false labor. 

Review of the hospital policy titled, ""Imminent Delivery-Care of Mother and Infant"", effective 8/18/17, indicated any pregnant patient over 20 weeks gestation that presents with symptoms possibly related to labor or trauma related complaints will be triaged as emergent, which will facilitate rapid deployment of needed resources. The physician must determine preterm labor, contractions onset, duration, bag of water intact, vaginal bleeding, fetal movement, fetal heart tones (normal range is 120-160), mother's vital signs and temperature, immunizations, and signs and symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]

Review of hospital policy titled, Qualified Interpreter Services for Limited English Proficient Persons, effective 11/1/19, reflected the following:  individuals who need spoken language assistance: When an interpreter encounter is complete, use of an interpreter is documented in the medical record or health plan file.  

Review of a 12/20/13 publication from CPDH and the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative titled ""Airway Management In Pregnant or Postpartum Women Having Seizures"" reflected the following: ""A seizure is a frightening and uncommon occurrence in Labor and Delivery and the visceral response of many providers is to immediately administer magnesium sulfate to stop the abnormal movement associated with the seizure. However, even more important than stopping the seizure, which usually stops on its own after 1-2 minutes, is maintaining and protecting the airway. Seizures do not directly cause death, but intracranial hemorrhage [bleeding inside the brain] and hypertensive [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [brain injury due to high blood pressure]. Therefore, the airway is the first priority in seizure management, even before administration of magnesium sulfate."" https://www.cmqcc.org/resource/airway-management-pregnant-or-postpartum-women-having-seizures-toolkit-pdf.

Based on EMTALA policy and procedure review, closed medical record reviews, and staff interviews, the hospital's Dedicated Emergency Department (DED) physician failed to ensure an appropriate transfer; by failing to complete a written physician's certification for transfer documenting the medical benefits and/or increased risks associated with the transfer for the specific Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) of the patient in 3 of 11 DED patients sampled that were transferred to another acute care hospital with an EMC for further treatment and stabilization (#14, #16, and #13); and failed to ensure the written physician's certification time closely matched the time the patient departed the DED for transfer in 3 of 11 DED patients transferred with an EMC to another acute care hospital for further treatment and stabilization (#14, #16 and  #12).

The findings include:

Review of the hospital policy titled ""EMTALA (The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act: Screening, Stabilization, and Transfer of Individuals with Emergency Medical Conditions)"" (EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act)  approved 8/2014 revealed ""...) ""Labor"" means the process of childbirth beginning with the latent or early phase of labor and continuing through the delivery of the placenta.  A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a physician, certified nurse midwife, or other Qualified Medical Person acting within his or her scope of practice as defined in Medical Center medical staff bylaws and State law, acetifies that, after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor...q) ""Stable for Transfer"" between medical facilities means: 1. the physician, or other Qualified Medical Person in consultation with the physician, determines, within reasonable clinical confidence, that the patient will sustain no material deterioration in his/her medical condition as a result of the transfer, and that the receiving facility has the capability to manage the Emergency Medical Condition and any reasonably foreseeable complication...3.  ""Stable for Transfer does not require the final resolution of the emergency Medical Condition"". 

1.  Medical record review of patient #14 revealed [AGE] year old presenting to the DED on 03/08/2015 at 0534 via ambulance with a chief complaint of history of diabetes, epilepsy ,headache and nausea.  Review of the medical screening exam (MSE) started at 0542 by the physician revealed the patient checked his blood glucose and it was ""noted to be high"". The patient reported he had been ""stripping a floor using a buffer requiring propane"".  The patient reported he gave himself 30 units of insulin and his symptoms did not improve.  He developed ""severe lightheadness and may have passed out"".

Based on interview, record review, and policy review, the facility failed to ensure one patient (#20) of 21 patients reviewed was entered into the central log (a record of each individual who presents for care). This failure increased the risk of substandard care for all patients entering the Obstetric (OB, the branch of medicine and surgery concerned with childbirth and the care of the women giving birth) Department. The OB average daily census was 12, the average monthly census was 360, and the total transfers were 17 for April through September of 2014. The facility census was 55.

Findings included:

Record review of the facility policy titled, ""EMTALA - Central Log,"" approved on 06/24/14, showed direction for facility staff to maintain a central log on each individual who came into the Emergency Department (ED). This included individuals that came by a ground, non-facility owned ambulance on facility property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at the facility's dedicated ED.

During an interview on 10/14/14 at 2:40 PM, Staff C, Accreditation, Patient Safety, Risk Manager, stated the ED and the OB logs were separate. The patients over 20 weeks along in pregnancy would present to OB and staff documented them on the OB log.

Record review of the facility's OB log showed no evidence of Patient #20 in the log.

During an interview on 10/15/14 at 1:00 PM, Staff L, Director of Peri-Natal (all OB areas), stated that Patient #20 was not in the log because Staff P, Registered Nurse (RN), believed she did not accept the patient.

During an interview on 10/15/14 at approximately 4:30 PM, Staff C stated that staff failed to log Patient #20 in the OB log. 

During a phone interview on 10/21/14 at approximately 7:30 PM, Staff CC, OB Technician, stated that she was relieving the Unit Secretary for lunch when Patient #20 presented to OB per stretcher with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff. Typically, a patient ambulated into the OB area, she entered patient information into the computer, and then she escorted the patient to a triage (exam area) bed. When EMS arrived, she was unsure of what she should do and Staff CC notified the Clinical Team Manager (CTM, charge nurse).

Based on review of the hospital EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) policies, staff/physician and record reviews, the facility failed to ensure staff followed their policies and did not provide 1 out of 20 patient records sampled from July 2020 - January 2021 (Patient 2) with a medical screening examination sufficient to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.    

Findings are:

A.   Review of facility policy titled ""MEDICAL SCREENING & TRANSFER"" dated 9/2020 defines an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) as: 
1. A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances, or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in a. ""Placing the health of the individual (or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or 
2. Pregnant Women with Contractions.  With respect to a pregnant woman who are having contractions, a medical condition for which: a. There is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer of the woman to another hospital before delivery; or b. Transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. 

A Medical Screening Examination (MSE) is defined as: An examination within the capability of Hospital's Dedicated Emergency Department (DED)--including ancillary services routinely available to the dedicated emergency department-- to determine with reasonable clinical confidence whether an EMC exists.  The MSE must be provided by ""qualified medical personal"".

Upon presentation on Hospital Property, an individual who is not otherwise a Hospital patient shall be provided an appropriate MSE within the capabilities of the DED.

It is the policy of (this hospital) to provide a MSE to all individuals presenting for emergency medical treatment within (this hospital) capabilities and without regard to the particular medical or specialty services sought.  (This hospital) will not deny evaluation, treatment, or stabilization to any individual on the basis of his or her perceived or actual: ability to pay; insurance coverage; race; national origin; sex; age or disability.  (This hospital) will not deny evaluation, treatment or stabilization to any individual on the basis of his or her presenting complaint, condition, or because his or her personal physician is not a member of the Hospital Medical Staff.

MSE to Confirm Labor: All individuals requesting examination for confirmation of the onset of labor --ie., pregnant women experiencing contractions--will be provided a MSE, despite the fact that (this hospital) does not operate or maintain obstetrical services.

B.  Review of the facility emergency room    Central Log revealed on 1/9/2021 at 20:45 (8:45 PM) a [AGE] year old female, name ""unknown"" presented to the emergency department.  In the column labeled ""Minutes Spent w/Patient"" staff entered ""0"", in the column labeled ""Minutes between Provider Notification and arrival"" staff entered ""0"", in the column labeled ""Nature of Injury/Illness"" staff entered ""30 wks pregnant, contractions, discharge"", in the column labeled ""Refused Treatment"" staff entered ""X"".  Staff did not enter any information (left blank) in the columns labeled ""Provider Arrival Time"", ""Emergency"", ""Non-Emergency"", ""Trauma"", ""Did Provider Evaluate"", ""Treatment/Stabilization"", ""admitted    "", ""Transferred"", ""Receiving Facility"", ""Treated and discharged   .""  Staff entered ""20:48: (8:48 PM) in the column labeled ""Time"" and did not enter any information (left blank) the column labeled ""Instruction Provided.""

C. In an interview on 1/13/21 at 5:40 PM, ED nurse Registered Nurse (RN A) stated that patient (Patient) 2 came to the ED entrance on 1/9/2021.  RN A opened the door and the patient asked ""am I in the right place?""  RN A stated that Patient 2 said she was ""[AGE] years old, 30 weeks pregnant having contractions and vaginal discharge.""  RN A stated, ""she asked if we provided OB (obstetrical) care.""  RN A stated she told Patient 2 that they are a small hospital and OB care is limited, that they have a doppler (machine to hear heart beat) and an emergency delivery kit, and told the patient we could examine her but would probably have to transfer her to (Hospital B).  RN A stated she told the patient she could call the provider on call and escorted Patient 2 to the nursing station.  The on call provider (Nurse Practitioner- NP) B was called and informed that the patient was asking about OB care.  The NP B said we don't have a TOCO (a machine to monitor uterine contractions), Fetal Monitor or infant warmer.  RN A said the patient said ""OK, I am going to (Hospital B) then left."" RN A said ""I didn't get the patient's name.""

D.  In a phone interview on 1/13/21 at 2:00 PM, NP B confirmed she was the practitioner on-call on 1/9/21.  When asked what NP B knew about (Patient 2) on 1/9/21 she stated, ""I got a call Saturday evening after 8:00 PM, the nurse said there was a 30 week pregnant lady asking if she should be (at this hospital) and wanted to know if we had OB capabilities.""  ""RN A said the patient was not asking to be seen, she just wanted to know if she was in the right place.""  ""I told the RN we could evaluate & treat the patient and if she had an OB problem, we would send the patient to (Hospital B), but then the RN said the patient left.""

A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances, or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in a. ""Placing the health of the individual (or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or 
2. Pregnant Women with Contractions.  With respect to a pregnant woman who are having contractions, a medical condition for which: a. There is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer of the woman to another hospital before delivery; or b. Transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. 

A Medical Screening Examination (MSE) is defined as: An examination within the capability of Hospital's Dedicated Emergency Department (DED)--including ancillary services routinely available to the dedicated emergency department-- to determine with reasonable clinical confidence whether an EMC exists.  The MSE must be provided by ""qualified medical personal"".

Upon presentation on Hospital Property, an individual who is not otherwise a Hospital patient shall be provided an appropriate MSE within the capabilities of the DED.

It is the policy of (this hospital) to provide a MSE to all individuals presenting for emergency medical treatment within (this hospital) capabilities and without regard to the particular medical or specialty services sought.  (This hospital) will not deny evaluation, treatment, or stabilization to any individual on the basis of his or her perceived or actual: ability to pay; insurance coverage; race; national origin; sex; age or disability.  (This hospital) will not deny evaluation, treatment or stabilization to any individual on the basis of his or her presenting complaint, condition, or because his or her personal physician is not a member of the Hospital Medical Staff.

MSE to Confirm Labor: All individuals requesting examination for confirmation of the onset of labor --ie., pregnant women experiencing contractions--will be provided a MSE, despite the fact that (this hospital) does not operate or maintain obstetrical services.

C. In an interview on 1/13/21 at 5:40 PM, ED nurse Registered Nurse (RN A) stated that patient (Patient) 2 came to the ED entrance on 1/9/2021.  RN A opened the door and the patient asked ""am I in the right place?""  RN A stated that Patient 2 said she was ""[AGE] years old, 30 weeks pregnant having contractions and vaginal discharge.""  RN A stated, ""she asked if we provided OB (obstetrical) care.""  RN A stated she told Patient 2 that they are a small hospital and OB care is limited, that they have a doppler (machine to hear heart beat) and an emergency delivery kit, and told the patient we could examine her but would probably have to transfer her to (Hospital B).  RN A stated she told the patient she could call the provider on call and escorted Patient 2 to the nursing station.  The on call provider (Nurse Practitioner- NP) B was called and informed that the patient was asking about OB care.  The NP B said we don't have a TOCO (a machine to monitor uterine contractions), Fetal Monitor or infant warmer.  RN A said the patient said ""OK, I am going to (Hospital B) then left."" RN A said ""I didn't get the patient's name.""

""RN A said the patient was not asking to be seen, she just wanted to know if she was in the right place.""  ""I told the RN we could evaluate & treat the patient and if she had an OB problem, we would send the patient to (Hospital B), but then the RN said the patient left.""
