Based on record review, observation, and interview during the Federal Survey, the Emergency Department (ED) staff failed to ensure that walk-in patients who presented to the ED were: (a) assessed prior to triage, and (b) continuously monitored after triage but before being provided with an Emergency Medical Screen Examination in fifteen (15) out of twenty-three (23) Medical Records reviewed (Patients #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #37, #38, #41, #43, #44, #46 and #47).

Findings:

(a) Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form revealed that Patient #29 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 6:13PM with complaints of chest pain.  No further documentation is noted until 11:00PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form for Patient #30 revealed the patient presented on ,d+[DATE] at 1:43PM with complaints of difficulty breathing.  No further documentation is noted until 11:00PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form revealed that Patient #34 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 3:18PM with complaints of chest pain.  No further documentation is noted until 11:50PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Similar findings were identified in Medical Record reviews for Patients #28, #31, #32 and #33.

During the tour of the Adult Walk-In emergency room    Triage Area on 02/12/14 at 10:30AM Staff Member #17 stated on interview ""I ask the person why they are here, their date of birth, and first then last name which are entered into the system.  I then tell them to take a seat to wait for the Nurse and give them a Registration Form to complete while they wait.  If they complain of three (3) or four (4) of the things on the list (ED Registration Process), I must tell the Nurse right away. ""

Review of the ""ED Registration Process"" (Instruction Sheet) documents that Security greets the patient and directs them to Room #3 for Registration.  The Registrar will ask the patients why they are being seen and is to interrupt the ED staff if anyone complains of chest pain, shortness of breath, is under three (3) months of age, has epigastric pain or looks sick.  Otherwise they complete the Triage Quick Registration (then sit in the Triage Waiting Area in front of the Triage Cubicles).

On 02/19/14 at approximately 11:30AM Staff Member #9 stated that after a patient ""Quick"" registers, the patient waits in the Waiting Room until the Triage Nurse calls their name.  If the patient doesn't answer, the Triage Nurse tries to call/find the patient every fifteen (15) minutes until three (3) tries have been made.  She then stated that this was not a written policy, but a practice.  Staff #9 then stated there is ""no Patient Record"" because the patient has not been triaged yet, and therefore no place for the Nurse to document what time or how many tries were attempted to call/find the patient in the Waiting Room.  Staff #9 also stated because there was no place to document the attempts, there is no record of how long it took from the patient's ""Quick"" Registration until the Triage Nurse actually went to triage them.  Therefore there is no way to track how long the patients waited to see the Triage Nurse, after Quick Registering, before walking out of the facility.

This interview was conducted with Staff Member #16 who also confirmed the above information.

(b) Patient #46 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of right calf pain and swelling.  The patient also complained of being occasionally short of breath for the past two (2) weeks.  
The patient was registered at 6:36PM and triaged at 7:26PM with an Acuity Level III, fifty (50) minutes later. 

Patient #47 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and dizziness.  She states that she is possibly pregnant and has had left lower quadrant pain.  The patient was registered at 6:35PM as an Acuity Level II, but was triaged at 7:10PM, thirty-five (35) minutes later.

Patient #35 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of palpitations ""for months"".  She states that she was sent by her Primary Medical Doctor.  The patient was registered at 12:24PM and was triaged as an Acuity Level III at 1:10PM, forty-six (46) minutes later.

Patient #37 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of being treated for a blood infection for three (3) weeks.  The patient states that during the night he had ""itching and uncontrollable chills"".  The patient was registered at 12:07PM and was triaged with an Acuity Level II at 12:37PM, thirty (30) minutes later.

Additional findings were identified in Medical Record reviews for Patients #38, #41, #43 and #44.

These findings were confirmed on 02/19/14 with Staff Member #18 during review of each Medical Record.

Review of the Policy titled ""Triage"" dated 08/13/13 revealed ""all patients presenting to the ED will undergo the triage process"" and a priority level will be documented with Level II defined as a high risk situation and Level III requiring many resources"".  The Policy does not include the Quick Registration Process.  

The Policy titled ""Patient Initial Screening"" dated 08/13/13 states that ""the initial screening examination will be completed under the supervision of an Attending Physician after the patient has been triaged"".

Based on document review and interview, the facility failed to maintain a complete central log for each individual presenting to the emergency department. Specifically, the facility failed to assure that all entries were complete and accurate.
Findings:
A review of the facility ' s emergency department log on 10/8/2013, identified missing diagnoses, complaints and accurate discharge dispositions for 5/11 patients who (MDS) dated [DATE] between 11:22 and 13:11. Each of these missing entries indicated that the patients were discharged    between 06:59-07:00 on 7/27/13. Based on interview with staff #3 on 10/11/13 at 3:00 and a review of the medical record for patient # 32 confirmed that the disposition was not accurate.  This patient was discharged    from the emergency department  the following morning but was referred to the obstetrical unit for evaluation and treatment.

Based on interviews and record review the facility failed to ensure patients requiring a higher or specialized level of care were transferred appropriately pursuant to EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) in 2 of 11 medical records reviewed in which patients where transferred out of the facility (Patient #7 and #12). 

Findings include:

Facility policy:

The policy, Emergency Department Transfer of Patients read, documentation of patient stabilization had been prepared by a physician or qualified medical person in consultation with a physician. The policy also read, the transferring hospital should document its communication with the receiving hospital, including the date and time of the transfer request and the name of the person accepting the transfer. The receiving facility must ensure it has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual, and has agreed to accept the transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment.

The policy, Admission to the emergency room    read, the provider shall determine whether the patient had an emergency medical condition and if necessary, stabilize the patient and/or admit the patient or initiate a transfer under medical necessity. 

The policy, Transfer of Patients: For a Patient Being Transferred to Another Health Care Facility read, the primary care provider was responsible to notify the receiving primary care provider and institution. The policy also read, the facility must copy appropriate medical records and complete patient transfer forms and orders, including a nursing summery and a care plan for the receiving facility.

1. The facility failed to ensure the receiving facility agreed to accept the patients for transfer and provide available documentation including patient consents. 

a. Patient #7 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 12:37 p.m. with contractions. The patient was documented to be 40 weeks and three days pregnant with her fourth child.

At 12:44 p.m. Patient #7 was examined by Physician #4 and according to emergency department provider assessment the patient was experiencing contractions two to three minutes apart with no loss of fluid or bleeding. 

At 12:49 p.m. Physician #4 documented Patient #7 needed to be transferred to a different facility (Facility B) for further labor and delivery care and that delivery was not imminent at that time. 

At 12:54 p.m., according to the prehospital report the patient was transported out of the facility by ambulance to Facility B. Further documentation revealed RN #11 told the emergency medical technician (EMT) to take the patient prior to all paperwork being completed and she would have paperwork completed upon the EMT's return to the facility.  

b. On 5/15/18 at 12:46 p.m. an interview was conducted with Physician #4 who had cared for Patient #7 on 4/8/18. Physician #4 stated the appropriate process for transferring a patient out of the facility included calling the receiving facility to confirm they had available beds, obtaining acceptance of the patient by a physician, giving report and filling out the proper paperwork to transport the patient. 

Physician #4 stated after he examined Patient #7, he determined the patient needed to be transferred to a facility with appropriate obstetrics care and ordered the transport team to take the patient to a different facility. Physician #4 stated, the emergency transport service crew were at the patient's bedside, ready to take the patient at that time.  

Physician #4 stated he did not call the receiving facility until approximately 20 minutes after the patient left and no paperwork was filled out or completed prior to transfer. 

c. On 5/15/18 at 3:59 p.m. an interview was conducted with Registered Nurse #11 who cared for Patient # 7 on 4/8/18. RN #11 stated she called report to Facility B and spoke with a registered nurse in the emergency department and the labor and delivery department after Patient #7 left the facility. 

RN #11 stated paperwork sent with the patient typically included the consent, any nursing documentation, vital signs and any testing completed (lab and radiology). RN #11 stated it was important to send as much information to the receiving facility so they could get the full picture of what was occurring with the patient. 

RN #11 stated Physician #4 did not fill out paperwork and sign the consent for transfer until 4:30 p.m. on 4/8/18. This was 4 hours after the patient left the facility. RN #11 was unsure what paperwork had been sent with the patient and was unsure if any paperwork had been faxed by the unit clerk after it had been completed by Physician #4. 

d. Similar findings were found in Patient #12's medical record. 

On review of Patient #12's medical record, the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:50 a.m. Patient #12 was triaged with a primary and secondary assessment were completed at 10:56 a.m. by Registered Nurse (RN) #1. RN #1 documented Patient #12's chief complaint as suicidal with a specific plan. 

At 11:14 a.m., the physician documented, on the ED Provider Assessment, that Patient #12 was brought in by ambulance with a history of bipolar, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder and a recent admission to a psychiatric facility for suicidal ideation's and with worsening suicidal ideation's. The patient was seen at a clinic yesterday, 11/20/17, and was noted to ""currently struggle with suicidal ideation."" 

At 11:41 a.m., RN #1 documented under the nursing assessment notes, Patient #12 was suicidal with a plan to overdose on her medications and complained of increased depression, anxiety and sadness. 

At 1:10 p.m., on the vitals signs flow sheet, it was documented Patient #12 took pills approximately 10-15 minutes ago. Review of the Emergency Nursing Record revealed RN #1 documented the patient came up to the nurses station and said she took approximately 60 pills about 15 minutes ago. 

At 2:35 p.m., a crisis evaluation was conducted. In the crisis evaluation, the crisis clinician documented Patient #12 was in need of stabilization inpatient treatment at a involuntary facility. 

At 6:42 p.m., RN # 1 documented the patient was being transferred under the care of the receiving facility physician and report to the RN at the receiving facility had been completed. RN #1 further documented all documents were ready for transport.

Review of Patient #12's record revealed no documentation that the physician caring for Patient #12 communicated with the receiving hospital, including the date and time of the transfer request and the name of the person accepting the transfer. This was in contrast to facility policy. 

On 5/15/18 at 1:31 p.m., an interview was conducted with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) #6. CMO #6 stated the facility policy was to call the receiving facility to ensure the receiving facility had the capability and capacity to care for the patient who was needing to be transferred. The physician then spoke to the receiving physician who accepted the patient called a ""doc to doc."" This was all required prior to the patient being transported. CMO #6 stated it was important for the doc to doc communication to be completed to ensure a safe handoff of patient care because the most dangerous part of transporting patients was when the patient was outside the facility and have access to less resources. CMO #6 stated receiving acceptance of a patient and then providing a doc to doc allows for the receiving team to prepare for the patient and identify if any changes in the patient's condition had occurred while in transient.  
 
CMO #6 on review of Patient #12's medical record confirmed there was no documentation on when the doc to doc had occurred and no documentation of what paperwork had been sent with the patient prior to being transported. CMO #6 stated the physician consent for transfer should always be completed and sent with the patient prior to being transported.

Based upon record review and interview, the facility failed to ensure 1 (#1) of 30 patients' medical records reviewed had received an appropriate medical screening examination in the Emergency Department and failed to follow the facility policy. 

Findings at Health Facility A on 09/04/2013:

Review of policy titled, ""Medical Screening Exam and Referral in the Emergency Department; Reference #1202 a: DATE Effective: 10/2011"" revealed: 

""Purpose: The purpose of the medical screening examination (MSE) is to determine with reasonable clinical confidence and within the capability of the Emergency Department (and the ancillary services routinely available to the Emergency Department) whether or not an individual who comes to the Emergency Department has an emergency medical condition. The MSE will be performed in a non-discriminatory manner, by qualified medical personnel as detailed below.

Policy Statement: All individuals presenting to be seen in the Emergency Department will be provided an appropriate MSE by Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP). A QMP includes physicians and nurses who are members of the medical staff who practice within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors, Medical Staff, Texas Medical Board, and Texas Board of Nursing. This includes but is not limited to the scope of licensure, certification, education and experience of the QMP. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or Emergency Department registered nurses who have received specialized training, demonstrated appropriate competence for performing appropriate MSE's will function under standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.

Based on whether the patient meets any exclusion criteria and the results of this MSE, the patient may either be directed to the Rural Health Clinic or Emergency Department for further medical examination and treatment. If an emergency medical condition is determined to exist, the hospital will provide any necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer.

The MSE must be the same MSE that would be performed on any individual coming to the Emergency Department, regardless of the individual's ability to pay. No information regarding the patients' payer status, HMO/PPO membership, or insurance shall be asked prior to the completion of the MSE.

After patients presenting to the ED will have a MSE completed by a QMP. This screening examination may be performed in the Emergency Department by a registered nurse who has been determined by the Chief Nursing Office and Emergency Department Nurse Manager to be qualified and experienced in emergency nursing and who is required to follow standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.  In the event the registered nurse performing the screening examination is uncertain about the nature of the patient's condition or the existence of an emergency, the patient will be referred to the Emergency Department physician for further screening.

The nature of the MSE will depend on the patient's presenting symptoms, and may only a brief history and physical examination.

I. The medical screening examination consists of:
a. Assessment of the patient's chief complaint
b. Vital signs
c. General appearance of the patient
d. Mental status
e. Location and degree of pain based on both subjective and objective data
f. Skin-visual inspection and tactile assessment when indicated
g. Ability to walk/limits on ambulation or movement of affected extremity

3. Is the patient four (4) years old or younger?
4. Is the patient sixty-five (65) years old or older?
5. Is the patient's presenting complaint a result of a Motor Vehicle Crash which has occurred within the past 7 days?
6. Is the patient's presenting complaint a work related injury?
7. Does the patient have VA benefits?

*If any of the answers are Yes, stop the MSE and admit patient to the ED. ""

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Triage Log"" from 03/01/2013 thru 08/31/2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the triage log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Elopement Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the elopement log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Transfer Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the transfer log.

A review of twenty-nine medical records at Health Facility A revealed no medical record for patient #1. 

Findings at Health Facility B on 09/05/2013 at 8:30 AM:

A review of patient #1's medical record at Health Facility B revealed patient was admitted on [DATE] at 9:50 PM. Nurses notes revealed ""After triage, this patient informed me that she had presented to triage at Health Facility A, and was told that  ""we can't help you here."" States she was told they did not do OB (obstetrics), and could not do ultrasounds and that they were too busy to see her at all for several hours and that she should go to Mount Pleasant. She also states that as they were passing through Pittsburg, they called ahead to Pittsburg, and were told by the ER  (emergency room   ) there that they too did not ""do babies"" and that she should go on to Mount Pleasant.""  

According to the labor and delivery admission assessment for patient #1, the assessment stated, ""pt (patient) admitted     to ldr1 (labor room #1) with c/o (complaints) of contractions, states receives prenatal care in Longview. Pt crying and restless with contractions, strong contractions palpated, sve (sterile vaginal examination) reveals bulging membranes and almost completely dilated. Patient's boyfriend and his mother arrived with pt. They are visibly upset and crying about inevitable, nonviable delivery and being ""turned away from Gilmer."" Mother states they stopped at Health Facility A (ER) first and were turned away. When questioned further the mother states that when they signed in to the ER  they were told that the hospital does not delivery babies and that the ER  was very busy trying ""to save someone's life"" and it would be ""hours and hours"" before the patient would be able to be seen. The patient was advised to go to either Longview or Mount Pleasant hospital to be seen by a hospital that delivers babies. The patient, her boyfriend and his mother then left and started on their way to Mount Pleasant. En route to Mount Pleasant the mother called Pittsburg ER  via mobile phone and inquired about whether they should stop there. They were told the best place would be Mount Pleasant since they were already on their way and Mount Pleasant delivered babies. Due to patient's condition, this information was obtained by the paternal grandmother of the fetus to which the patient agrees.""  

Patient delivered spontaneous vaginal delivery 20 week fetal demise on August 19, 2013 at 6:17 AM. Patient discharged    home from Health Facility B on 08/21/2013 at 9:41 AM.   

A phone interview with family member #16 on 09/05/2013 at 10:30 AM stated, ""My son called and said we are on our way to the emergency room    in Gilmer my girlfriend is having bad cramps. I told him I was on my way, and when I drove up to the emergency room    in Gilmer, my son and his girlfriend were coming out the door of the emergency room   . They told me this emergency room    doesn't deliver babies and we would have to go to Longview or Mount Pleasant. I chose Mount Pleasant because it's a better road and it's a straight shot. On the way I called Pittsburg emergency room    because it's on the way to Mount Pleasant and my son's girlfriend was hurting so bad.  They informed me they don't deliver babies either and I need to go on to Mount Pleasant. So we went to Mount Pleasant Hospital.""

A phone interview with patient #1 on 09/05/2013 at 11:10 AM stated, ""I went to the Gilmer emergency room    on   Sunday August 18th around 8:00 PM with my boyfriend. I was having bad cramping. I sat down where you register for an emergency room    visit. I signed a piece of paper. The clerk told me ""I didn't tell you this, but it will be hours before someone sees you because the emergency room    is busy and they are trying ""to save someone's life."" We don't take care of babies here."" The clerk told me Mount Pleasant or Longview is the closest place. My boyfriend and I left. My boyfriend's mother drove us to Mount Pleasant. Patient #1 was questioned did you see a nurse or physician before you left? She stated, ""No.""

On a return visit back to Health Facility A on 09/05/2013 at 12:00 PM requested the emergency room    clerk schedule. Staff member #17 was the admitting clerk working the evening of August 18th, date in question.

A phone interview with staff #17 on 09/05/2013 at 12:10 PM stated, ""I remember patient #1 because she left her social security card that night. It is in the top drawer where I sit in the second registration desk area. Staff member #17 was questioned did patient #1 sign into the emergency room   . Staff #17 stated, she signed the piece of paper that asks for name, date of birth, social security#, and reason for visit. I remember there was patient behind her saying why are you checking into this hospital they don't deliver babies. I had to leave the area and take papers to the nurses in the emergency room   . When I came back the patient asked me if this hospital delivers babies? I am not supposed to give out any information, but when patient asks a direct question I can answer. So I told her, ""no we don't deliver babies here, the closest places are Longview and Mount Pleasant."" They got up and left. Staff member #17 was questioned as to what happened to the piece of paper the patient signed? She stated, ""I put it in the shred box when they left."" Staff #17 was questioned as to whether patient saw a nurse or a physician? She stated, ""No.""

An interview with the Director of the Emergency Department on 09/05/2013 at 12:30 PM confirmed, if any patient had presented to the emergency room    the patient would have been registered by the clerk and the patient would have signed the paper that request name, date of birth, social security #, and reason for visit. 

On 09/05/2013 at 12:35 PM the emergency room    Manager and I went to the emergency room    registration area. We found the patient's original social security card in the top drawer of the second registration desk, where staff member #17 told me she had placed it.

An interview with the Administrator, Chief Nursing Officer, and the emergency room    Manager, confirmed the patient #1 original social security card was left at the registration desk. Patient #1 had not received a medical screening, nor was the patient on the triage log, elopement log, and transfer log. Also the facility policy for medical screening examinations had not been followed.

A. Based on document review and staff interview, it was determined for 1 of 4 (Pt #1) obstetrical patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED), the hospital failed to provide an appropriate transfer. This has the potential to affect all obstetrical patients receiving care in an ED that treats approximately 34 patients a day.

Finding include:

1.  On 08/31/2022 at approximately 9:30 AM the policy, ""OB: Maternal Transfer (revised October 2009)"" was reviewed. The policy stated ""Policy: Maternal patients >20 weeks will be transferred to the appropriate level of care... B. Maternal-Fetal Transport Data: All patients who are potentials for transfer to another facility should have the following available: Current vital signs, Fetal Heart Tones, Medical Screening, Presence of vaginal discharge (ie bleeding, amniotic fluid), IV fluids, previous and current medical records if available. Procedure: A. Assess the patient prior to transfer. "" 

2.  On 08/31/2022 at approximately 11:45 AM, an interview was conducted with the Director of Quality and Safety (E #1) and the Chief Nursing Officer (E #3). E #1 stated ""We had received a phone call from the Perinatal Center with concerns related to a pt who presented to (Receiving Facility) stating that (Pt #1) had presented to our facility with concerns that (Pt #1's) water had broke. We started an investigation. Initially, there was no patient record (not on the log). Based on information provided by the Perinatal Center and a review of our cameras in the ED, we determined when the patient presented and when the patient left. We created a Sensor (Patient Safety) event and spoke with the nurse.""

3. On 08/31/2022 at approximately 2:00 PM, Pt #1's record from the Receiving Facility was reviewed. Pt #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 11:45 PM and was taken to Obstetrical Triage Room #1. Pt #1's ""OB History and Physical"" stated, ""(Pt #1) ... is being admitted     for emergent cesarean section cesarean section due to PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) with prolapse of fetal part and fetal bradycardia (low heart rate).... Per patient report, (Pt #1) has spontaneous rupture of membranes at 10:00 PM. (Pt #1) called the (primary OB's office) Telenurse and was advised to seek evaluation for rupture of membranes at (Transferring Hospital). Patient and partner reported that (Pt #1) was triaged and advised to come directly to (Receiving Hospital) as (Transferring Hospital) would not be able to intervene. It does not appear that the patient was evaluated by a physician or that fetal heart tones were obtained prior to leaving outside facility. (Pt #1) presented to triage, and on exam by (Maternal Fetal Medicine physician), (Pt #1) was noted to have a fetal arm prolapsing into the vagina. A Code Mom was initiated and the patient was transferred to the OR emergently. In the OR, BSUS (bedside ultrasound) demonstrated transverse (cross-lying) fetus. Fetal heart tones were not able to be obtained with external cardiotocography (continuous recording of the fetal heart rate obtained by an ultrasound transducer placed on the mother's abdomen) and fetal heart tones were unable to be visualized on BSUS (bedside ultrasound) with Doppler; however, possible fetal bradycardia was noted. FSE (fetal scalp electrode)was placed and FHT (Fetal Heart Tones) were indeterminate. She underwent an emergent classical cesarean section... delivered infant who was 930 grams (2 pounds 0.8 ounces) and had APGARs (describes the condition of the newborn at 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes of life.  It is scored based on muscle tone, pulse, reflex irritability, skin color, and respiration) of 0, 0, 0 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes (indicating demise) respectively."" The ""OB Cesarean Delivery Operative Note"" stated, ""(Pt #1) reports that (Pt #1) had been experiencing cramping since 8/6/2022. On 8/9/2022, (Pt #1) felt worsening cramping and the sensation to have a bowel movement. While attempting to have bowel movement, (Pt #1) noted a large gush of clear fluid at 22:00. (Pt #1) subsequently presented to (receiving facility) for evaluation.... decision was made to proceed with an emergent cesarean section.""  

4. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 2:00 PM an interview was conducted with ED RN (E #4). E #4 stated ""OB patients get triaged, assessed (including vitals and fetal heart tones), and then we notify the ED physician. After the medical screening exam (MSE), the physician will make a determination on the need for transfer and determine the means of transport (whether Advanced Life Support ambulance, transfer team from the receiving facility, or if capable of taking a private car).  Pt #1 did not receive a medical screening exam so there was no determination made of the need for transfer or appropriate way to transfer""     



B. Based on document review and interview, it was determined that for 3 of 10  (Pt #8, Pt #12 and Pt #14), clinical records reviewed for transfer, the Hospital failed to complete the transfer forms. This has the potential to affect all patients receiving care in an ED that treats approximately 34 patients a day.

Findings include:

1. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 11:00 AM, Pt #8's record was reviewed. Pt #8 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on 7/27/2022 at 8:08 PM, with a chief complaint of overdose. Pt #8's medical screening examination was done at 8:08 PM. Pt. #8 was transferred to a Behavioral Health In-patient facility. Pt. #8's ""Physician Certificate of Transfer"" form was incomplete. The form lacked documentation of the relationship to the patient for consent to transfer. The form lacked documentation that medical records were sent to the receiving facility.  
 
2. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 1:00 PM, Pt #12's record was reviewed. Pt #12 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1:42 AM, with a chief complaint of foot pain. Pt #12's medical screening examination was done at 1:50 AM. Pt. #12 was transferred to another facility with a diagnosis of foot abscess. Pt. #12's ""Physician Certificate of Transfer"" form was incomplete. The form lacked documentation that medical records were sent to the receiving facility.  
 
3. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 3:15 PM, Pt #14's record was reviewed. Pt #14 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1:52 PM, with a chief complaint of Closed head injury. Pt #14's medical screening examination was done at 2:25 PM. Pt. #14 was transferred to another facility with a diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury. Pt. #14's ""Physician Certificate of Transfer"" form was incomplete. The form lacked documentation that medical records were sent to the receiving facility.

4. An interview with the Manager of Patient Safety (E #2) was conducted during the record reviews. E #2 verbally agreed the records do not indicate that the medical record was sent to the receiving facility and agreed the signature for Pt #8 did not indicate the relationship to the patient. E #2 stated, ""The signature does not match any names listed on the patient's chart. I am unsure who signed the consent form.""

Based on record review and interview, the hospital failed to provide a medical screening exam on all patients who presented to the emergency department with an emergency complaint for 1 (#2) of 21 (#1-21) patients sampled. This deficient practice is evidenced by Patient #2 presenting to the emergency department seeking medical treatment for an OB issue, speaking with  S5RN and then leaving the emergency department without receiving a medical screening exam because the hospital does not provide ultrasound and OB services.

Findings:  

In an interview on 04/19/2022 at 2:25 p.m. S2DON presented a document printed from the ED Registration process showing Patient #2 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 4:02 p.m. and the record was deleted on 04/02/2022 at 4:03 p.m. by S6Clk. S6Clk also documented a note stating: Set visit   deleted note to patient opted not to be seen since facility does not have ultrasound or OB. Per S5RN. 

On 04/25/2022 at 11:50 a.m. S2DON reviewed Patient #2's Medical Record dated 04/02/2022 and verified Patient #2 did not receive a medical screening exam prior to leaving the ED.

In a telephone interview on 04/28/2022 at 8:53 a.m. S6Clk stated she remembered Patient #2 coming to the emergency department with an OB concern. She also remembered S5RN speaking with Patient #2 prior to triage and Patient #2 leaving the emergency department without being triaged or completing a medical screening exam. 

A review of Patient #2's medical record from Hospital A revealed Patient #2 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 7:22 p.m. with a chief complaint of pregnant with last cycle on December 11, 2021. State had a miscarriage in November, 2021. She reports had some spotting today, not enough to fill a pad. 
Patient #2 received a physical exam, urinalysis, urine pregnancy test, CMP, HCG- Quantitative, CBC and ultrasound. 
Patient #2 was diagnosed    with 2nd or 3rd trimester limited, 1 or more Fetuses, 13 weeks IUP, threatened miscarriage and Acute cystitis without hematuria. 
Patient #2 was discharged    with medications and plan to follow up with her MD as soon as possible in 2 days.

Based on review of twenty emergency department records, patient #1's obstetrical record from another hospital (RMH), a review of the hospital's bylaws, and review of the policies and procedures for patients who present to the emergency department, it was determined that in one (patient #1) of twenty-one patients who presented to the hospital requesting emergency services, the hospital failed to ensure compliance with 489.24. Patient #1 presented to the hospital in labor and was refused treatment and was not provided a medical screening examination on 11/21/11. This resulted in an immediate jeopardy to the patient's health and safety. The immediate jeopardy has the potential to affect all patients who are pregnant and present to the hospital in labor.  The immediate jeopardy is cited at 42 CFR 489.24, C2406

_x000d_
Based on documentation and interviews, the hospital failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department received a medical screening examination, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed, in one of twenty-one patients reviewed (Patient #1). Findings include:

Documentation and interviews revealed that patient #1 went into labor during the night of 11/21/11 and  her labor progressed more rapidly than patient #1 expected. Person (F) drove patient #1 to the local hospital (SCBH) for care, although it was originally planned that she would deliver at another hospital (RMH) which was several miles from (SCBH). Person (F) went to the front door of the emergency department and informed nurse (C) that patient  #1 was in the car and in labor. In response to person (F's ) request for care, nurse (C) told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and that he should continue to drive to their original destination, RMH. Patient #1's labor became more severe on the way to RMH, so person (F) stopped the car, called 911 and delivered the baby in the car. The ambulance arrived and transported patient #1 and the baby to RMH.

Review of patient #1's 11/21/11 ambulance record confirmed that on 11/21/11, at 3:44 a.m., a 911 call was received and an ambulance was dispatched to an identified location on a highway between Benson, MN and Willmar, MN. The request for an ambulance was related to child birth and upon arrival the paramedics observed patient #1 in the passenger seat of the vehicle with her baby lying on her chest. The paramedics examined patient #1 and the baby and determined that they were both stable. Patient #1 and the baby were transported by ambulance to RMH for ongoing care. 

Review of patient #1's 11/21/11 hospital record confirmed that patient #1 was admitted     to RMH at 4:17 a.m. and that person (F) and patient #1 had requested care at SCBH prior to the delivery of the baby in the car.

Person (F) was interviewed by phone on 12/12/11, and he confirmed that when he and patient #1 went to the ED at  SCBH seeking care for patient #1 during the night of 11/21/11. He stated he pushed the ED button and nurse (C) came out to the car and told him SCBH did not provide obstetrical services. When person (F) requested that nurse (C) call an ambulance for patient #1, nurse (C) refused and told person (F) to continue driving to his intended destination, RMH.

Nurse (C) was interviewed in person on 12/15/11, and she confirmed that patient #1 was not provided a medical screening examination and further assistance when she arrived at the ED in labor on 11/21/11. She stated she told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and told him to continue driving to his intended destination, RMH. She stated she did not attempt to call an ambulance for patient #1 and did not inform RMH that patient #1 was on her way.  

Nurse (D) was interviewed in person on 12/15/11, and she stated she was working the 11/21/11 night shift on a unit adjacent to the ED. She stated she heard the ED buzzer ring and followed nurse (C) out the ED door because she was concerned about her safety. Nurse (D) stated she was holding the ED door open and clearly overheard the entire conversation between nurse (C) and person (F) that occurred by person (F's) car. She stated nurse (C) told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and told person (F) to continue driving to RMH. Nurse (C) did not offer patient #1 a medical screening examination and when person (F) asked if an ambulance should be called, nurse (C) replied ""no."" Patient #1 was sitting in the passenger seat of the car and looked very uncomfortable.  

The hospital's EMTALA policy, dated March 2010 and revised on 1/5/11, states ""All patients presenting to the ER  (emergency room   ) will be given a medical screening exam. Any patient with an EMC (Emergency Medical Condition) or in labor will be stabilized. Appropriate transfer will be provided when patient requests or SCBH does not have capability or capacity to provide the necessary treatment.""

Based on the facility self report;  interviews of nursing staff, a physician, and a paramedic; and review of the hospital's documentation, policies and procedures; the facility failed to comply with the agreement of the special responsibilities in emergency cases  for 1 of 31 sampled emergency patients [Patient 31] by failing to provide Patient 31 with a medical screening examination [MSE].  The hospital had come back into compliance with EMTALA requirements at the time of the investigation.

Findings are:

     A.  Review of Medical Staff Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations confirmed the hospital did have the EMTALA requirements for Medicare Hospitals included.  The hospital Policy and Procedure titled  ""Medical Screening Examination & Stabilization""  [MSE] was last revised and approved 11/2014 by the Medical Staff and the Governing Body.  The policy directs that an MSE obligation is triggered when:
     1. ""The individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an     examination or treatment for a medical condition or
      2.  A prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.""
     The policy continues to define that the MSE (the determination of an emergency medical condition) is to be determined by a physician or qualified medical practitioner.  The policy defines who may perform an MSE to include:  a qualified physician with appropriate privileges ... a physician's assistant, or an advanced practice registered nurse who has been credentialed and is a member of the medical staff approved by the governing board [with the appropriate privileges and within their scope of practice].
     The policy includes the definition of an MSE for a pregnant woman which should include at a minimum:   ongoing evaluation of fetal heart tones, regularity and duration of contractions, fetal position and station, cervical dilation, and status of membranes (ruptured, leaking or intact).
       B.  The Administrator [CEO], Chief Operating Officer [COO], and the Manager of ED  learned of the incident from an email from the Registered Nurse that diverted Patient 31 from the ambulance bay of the hospital on [DATE] [RN-A].  The CEO and COO met with the Director of Nursing, the Manager of ED and other administrative staff on 1/12/2015.  They knew this was a violation of EMTALA and decided they must report it.  The CEO called and then emailed the self-report on 1/14/2015.  
      C.  The facility had pursued corrective action to achieve compliance with the EMTALA requirements prior to the investigation.  The initial step taken was to counsel RN-A and the physician who had directed the ambulance be diverted [MD-B], which was accomplished on 1/12/2015.  Verification was found in interviews with RN-A and MD-B, as well as review of facility documentation.  The facility revised its policies and procedures related to transfers to ensure they were more clear regarding EMTALA requirements.  The training was provided to all Medical Staff including all mid-level practioners on the Medical Staff.  The training was also provided to all nursing staff.  The training included improvement of communication between nursing staff and physicians or mid level providers.  These meetings were completed on 1/15/2015, prior to the survey start of 1/16/2015.  This training was verified by review of the materials presented and sign in sheets.  The staff had to complete competencies that were confirmed by review of the copies of the certificates for all medical staff and all nursing staff.  Three (3) nursing staff that had not attended the meetings will not be able to work until they have had the training according to the Director of Nursing.  The facility has scheduled training (by another hospital who provides labor and obstetric services) for management of imminent delivery and neonatal care on  2/5/2015 for their staff.   The facility has also contracted with a hospital to provide annual training on care of patient in labor and newborns.

1. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure the use of an appropriate mode of transportation for 1 of 16 sampled records (Patients #1) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to use an appropriate mode of transportation put the patients at risk of not receiving appropriate care during transfer.

Findings include:

The physician is responsible for determining the appropriate mode of transport, equipment, and transporting professionals to be used for the transfer. . . .""

- Reviewed on January 11-12, 2011, the medical record for Patient #1 indicated the patient sought medical assistance from the facility for shortness of breath and weakness on 10/24/10. The record lacked evidence the physician completed a medical screening examination. Failure to complete an appropriate medical screening examination did not allow the physician to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed, whether the patient's medical condition was stabilized before transfer, and the appropriate mode of transporatation. The emergency room    Note, dated 10/24/10, stated, "". . . Apparently the patient has had [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]since April of this past year. She has been tolerating things relatively well until the last 2 days when she has become progressively short of breath, weaker, and unable to get around much at all. She was scheduled to see [name of physician] for electrical conversion . . . she [patient's daughter] was especially worried about what to do since her mother appeared to be getting worse and wondered about how she could see a cardiologist. . . . [name of patient's daughter] will drive her mother to the emergency room    at [name of receiving facility]. The patient was stable when she left, I see no problem with them driving via automobile. I did not think it was necessary to do a formal emergency room    consult as the daughter basically brought her mother in with the question of how she could get her seen sooner rather than wait until she was seen as things were going. The daughter said that she was worried that she would run out of time and that her mother would die. . . ."" An addendum to the emergency room    Note, dated 10/24/10 at 5:36 [unspecified as a.m. or p.m.], stated, "". . . I had nothing to offer this patient here so I did not do EKG's [electrocardiogram], lab, chest x-rays, and the like . . .""

During a telephone interview on 01/14/11 at 10:40 a.m., the receiving emergency department physician (#9), stated he could not believe the condition the patient was in when she walked into the ER. This physician (#9) stated the patient did not have much time left, maybe an hour and the outcome would have been mu[DIAGNOSES REDACTED]erent. This physician (#9) said he would expect rudimentary work-up, breathing treatment, O2 (oxygen), dose of steroid, and transfer via ambulance (not a private car) in case a problem arose on the way. The patient arrived at the receiving facility with no physician note or documentation showing that anything was done at the transferring facility.


2. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure the physician certified the medical benefits outweighed the risks at the time of transfer for 3 of 16 sampled records (Patients #3, #4, and #8) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to ensure the physician certified the medical benefits outweighed the risks for transfer placed the patients at risk of receiving an inappropriate transfer.

Based on observation, interviews, review of documentation in clinic notes and the ED record of 1 of 1 patient who presented to the hospital's on campus outpatient clinic with chest pain (Patient 8), review of documentation in the ED record of 1 of 1 pregnant patient who presented to the ED with possible leg clots (Patient 11), review of documentation in 2 of 2 medical records of patients who were transferred from SAMCBC to other hospitals for services not available at SAMCBC (Patients 10 and 14), and review of hospital policies and procedures and other documentation, it was determined that the hospital failed to develop and enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure compliance in the following areas:
* Medical Screening Examinations;  
* Appropriate transfers of patients; and
* Whistleblower protection.

Findings included:

1. Regarding MSEs refer to the findings identified under Tag C2406, CFR 489.24(a) and (c).

2. Regarding appropriate transfers refer to the findings identified under Tag C2409, CFR 489.24(e)(1-2).

3.a. Regarding whistleblower protection: The policy and procedure titled ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) Compliance -- SAHS dated as approved 05/18/2018, was reviewed and contained no language related to the required EMTALA whistleblower protection. 

b. The policy and procedure titled ""Non-Retaliation,"" dated as approved 10/16/2018 was provided and reviewed. It reflected ""No one at any level of the organization is permitted to engage in retaliation against a colleague for...Reporting in good faith a concern related to safety or quality of patient care, workplace safety, the Organizational Integrity Program, or a potential violation of applicable laws, regulations, or rules."" The policy included only general anti-retaliation language and indicated it applied to ""potential violations of applicable laws, regulations, or rules."" It did not distinguish what laws, regulations or rules it was applicable to, and did not include any reference to EMTALA or the specific EMTALA whistleblower requirements required by this CFR. 

c. The ""Trinity Health Code of Conduct"" was provided and reviewed. Page 8 reflected that EMTALA required hospitals with a DED to provide a MSE to any individual who comes to the ED before asking questions about their ability to pay for services. Page 27 reflected general anti-retaliation language applicable ""to those who report issues and concerns in good faith, including potential violations of our Code of Conduct."" It did not include any information about EMTALA whistleblower protection as required by this CFR.

Based on interviews, documentation in 6 of 6 medical records reviewed of patients who were evaluated to have an EMC and were transferred or directed to other hospitals (Patients 1, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15), and review of policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that appropriate transfers of patients with EMCs were conducted. An appropriate transfer for Patient 1 was not conducted as a physician or a qualified medical person had not signed the required certification, the receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient, medical records were not sent with the patient, appropriate transportation with qualified personnel was not used, and patient-specific risks of transfer were not identified. In addition, the risks of transfer were not patient-specific for Patients 11 through 15. 

Findings include:

1. *The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Emergency Treatment and Active labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities"", dated as last revised ""6/12"", was reviewed.  The policy required ""Transfers are made physician-to-physician...The patient may be transferred only when the receiving hospital or facility has consented to accept the patient...All pertinent medical information shall accompany the patient being transferred and the transfer shall be effected through qualified personnel and transfer equipment.""

The policy reflected ""Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) means...A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]...With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions...That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or ...That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child."" 

The procedure portion of the above document reflected ""Prior to transfer, an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient.  Risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and written on the Patient Transfer Form...Patients may be transferred (1) at their own request...or (3) if physician or qualified care provider certifies in writing that the benefits of transferring the patient to another facility outweigh the risk...Arrangements for proper conveyance will then be made...The evaluating care provider will place a call to the receiving care provider and health care facility. The necessary information will be relayed. The receiving facility must (1) be informed of the transfer and (2) agree to accept the patient, provide appropriate medical treatment and have space and qualified personnel available...The referring and receiving care providers share the responsibility for patient transfer and they should consult regarding the arrangements and details for patient transfer, including the method of transportation.  The care provider arranging transportation is responsible for determining what additional care is required before transfer, and what capabilities should be available en route (sic)...Accompanying records sent with patient...A 'Transfer form'... must be completed for each transfer...The nurse caring for patient is responsible for calling a nursing report to the receiving facility unit. Report should be documented in nurses' notes including name of nurse receiving report...Transfer summary should be completed and nursing goals addressed prior to transfer...Documentation to occur on patient's chart (1) Notification of acceptance by the receiving heath care facility (2) How patient is transferred (3) Records that accompanied the patient (4) Reasons for transfer... (5) Note by the physician of the patient's condition at the time of transfer (6) Notification of patient's family (7) Explanation of benefits and risks are explained to patient/family."" 

* The Professional Staff Policies and Procedures, dated as last revised 07/25/2014, were reviewed. These were part of the Professional Staff Bylaws and applied to MDs and other LIPs.  ""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 1.F. Medical Screening Examinations"" reflected that the professional staff had designated RNs with specified experience and qualifications as ""qualified medical personnel who may be permitted to perform medical screening examinations"" for OB patients.

""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 1.G. Against Medical Advice (AMA) Discharges"" reflected ""When the patient leaves the Hospital without an opportunity to be given an explanation of the risks of leaving, the medical record should include any attempts to explain the risks and to request that the patient sign a release form."" 

""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 2.K. Emergency Medical Record"" reflected ""If a patient is transferred to another facility, the transfer process shall be fully documented in the medical record.  If a patient leaves the Hospital against medical advice (AMA), this shall also be noted. A copy of the record of emergency services provided shall be communicated to the Member, practitioner or agency responsible for any follow-up care.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Perinatal Triage and Medical Screening Examination"", dated as last revised ""10/13"", was reviewed. The policy reflected ""Labor as defined by EMTALA, is the process of childbirth beginning with the latent phase of labor or early phase of labor and continuing through delivery of the placenta.  A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a qualified medical person...certifies that after a reasonable time of observation the woman is in false labor.""

The policy included direction for a qualified Perinatal RN to conduct an initial evaluation of the patient and ""Following evaluation and communication between RN and LIP, the LIP will provide direction to admit, discharge, or transfer the patient.""

""Utilize the following guidelines if a patient...wishes to leave hospital:  Provider informs the patient of the risks and benefits of the examination and/or treatment...Document the description of the examination and treatment that was refused by the patient...Follow hospital procedure related to consent for leaving hospital against advice (i.e. Against Medical Advice release).""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Transfer of Maternal Perinatal Patient"", dated as last revised ""10/13"", was reviewed. The policy stipulated ""A patient who meets the criteria of an emergency medical condition may not be transferred until she is stabilized unless...The patient requests a transfer, in writing, after being informed of the hospital's obligations under the law and the risks of transfer...An LIP signs a written certification that based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or unborn child.""

The procedure included the following requirements for the RN: ""Notify appropriate LIP of initial assessment findings...In most cases, the LIP will complete an examination of the patient prior to transfer...Telephone orders authorizing transfer may be accepted based on clinical situation. LIP to evaluate patient prior to transfer as appropriate per clinical status. Telephone orders must be signed by physician as contemporaneously as possible...Explain to the patient, prior to transfer, the need for transfer and the alternatives to transfer.

Nurse caring for patient is responsible for this report.""  Under the procedure section for ""Transportation & Equipment"" the RN was directed to notify the nursing supervisor to arrange for transportation.  Under the procedure section for ""Forms  & Paperwork"" the RN was directed to ""Complete patient transfer form for each transfer...Print patient transfer summary from EMR...Copy of medical records not in EMR.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Trial of Labor After Cesarean Section"", dated as last approved ""4/14"", was reviewed. The policy statement was ""Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital [and three other named hospitals] do not offer a trial of labor after cesarean section delivery.""

The procedure reflected that ""Risk for uterine rupture in women with a previous uterine scar...increases...for women who proceed with a TOLAC after one cesarean delivery...LIP should be notified immediately after initial assessment of patient's presence on the maternity unit...Refer to procedures related to...Obstetric Emergencies...Initiate procedures for obstetric emergency and treatment of suspected fetal or maternal compromise...Anticipate need for hemorrhage management if patient has uterine rupture.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""The Plan for the Provision of Care Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital"", dated as last revised ""3/2014"", was reviewed. The policy reflected the hospital did not have a NICU.  Under the ""Scope of Service"" it reflected ""When critical care or specialty care, not available at PHRMH, is needed for newborn and pediatric patients, they will be transferred to a more comprehensive facility based on medical necessity and parent or guardian preference."" 

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Patient's Leaving ED Before Treatment is Completed"", dated as last revised ""7/2013"", was reviewed. The policy reflected ""AMA: When a patient refuses to complete a medical screening examination, or consent to recommended treatment or transfer, risks and benefits should be discussed and an Informed Consent to Refuse form signed...the LIP should explain to the patient in understandable terms the risks of refusal of treatment or transfer...The nurse or LIP should complete the Informed Consent to Refuse form...The RN should document the patient's condition and circumstances surrounding the refusal of treatment or transfer in the medical record.""

2. The medical record of Patient 1 was reviewed.  The ""Patient Demographics"" section of the record reflected that the patient presented to the hospital's labor and delivery unit on 09/28/2014 at 0610.

The ""OB Triage Care Record"" reflected that at 0619 the RN documented the following: ""Fetal Movement active...sterile vaginal exam per RN...bloody show...engaged...Cervical Dilation (cm) 3...Cervical Effacement 90%...Cervical Position 1 - mid...Cervical Consistency 0 - firm...Fetal Station - 2...Bishop Score Dilation 2...Effacement 3...Cervical Position 1...Cervical Consistency 0...Station 1...Total 7.""

The ""OB Triage Care Record"" reflected that at 0621 the RN documented the following: ""Amniotic Fluid Color clear...Amniotic Fluid Amount moderate...Amniotic Fluid Odor none...AmniSure Test...grossely (sic) ruptured.""

The ""OB Triage Care Record"" reflected that at 0629 the RN documented the following: ""Fetal HR Mode auscultation...Baseline Rate 150...UA Mode other...10-15 mins per pt.""

A progress note electronically ""filed"" by an RN on 09/28/2014 at 0625 reflected: ""[MD] notified of pt status: pt grossly ruptured, 3/90/-2, UC's per pt about 10-15 mins, FHR for 3 mins at 150, ok to discharge without full NST.  Plan to discharge to OHSU for VBAC."" There was no other documentation by the RN after that note.  

The ""Lab Results"" section of the record reflected that on 09/28/2014 at 0610 a specimen of amniotic fluid was collected for a ""ROM (Amnisure) test and was sent to the hospital's lab.  The ""Final result"" was recorded on 09/28/2014 at 0648 and was ""Negative."" 

The only entry recorded under the ""Discharge Instructions"" section of the record was written as ""None"".

The ""Patient Demographics"" section of the record reflected the following: ""discharge date   /Time None...Discharge Disposition Home Or Self Care...Discharge Destination None."" 

There was no documentation related to implementation of the ""plan to discharge to OHSU"", including but not limited to: a written or telephone physician's order for ""discharge to OHSU"", communications with the patient about the assessment and plan, instructions given, risks and benefits discussed, physician to physician communications with OHSU, whether medical records were sent, mode of transportation arranged, who accompanied the patient, and time of discharge.  In addition, there was no documentation to reflect that the patient refused an appropriate transfer.

A progress note electronically ""filed"" by an MD the following day on 09/29/2014 at 1615 reflected: ""Patient called answering service 5:34 am 9/28/2014 and descirbed (sic) loss of fluid and blood tinged mucous, subsequently urinated. [Patient's] birth plan is VBAC at OHSU, advised to stop at triage in Hood River on [patient's] way to Portland and confirm ROM prior to proceeding to Portland.  Per nurse at approximately 6:30 am FHT 150s, contractions Q 10-15 minutes, patient grossly ruptured, cervix 3/90/-2.  Instructed not to wait for amniosure (sic) confirmation but to go directly to OHSU for labor management as previously planned.  FHT reviewed 150s.""  There was no other documentation by the MD prior to or after that note.

* The patient's pre-natal OB records from a clinic in Hood River were provided and reviewed.  Those reflected the patient's estimated date of delivery between 10/26/2014 and 11/04/2014.  The patient's documented history included a prior C-section ""due to breech"", and other risk factors such as a congenital single kidney, pre-diabetes, and obesity.  

* Mapquest reflects OHSU in Portland, Oregon is 65 miles and one hour and 11 minutes drive time from PHRMH in Hood River, Oregon.

* On 10/03/2014 at approximately 1330 the Associate Administrator of Patient Services and the Quality Management Coordinator were interviewed. They reported that on 09/29/2014 the PHRMH FBC Manager received an inquiry about Patient 1 who had presented to OHSU on 09/28/2014 in the a.m. where he/she delivered a newborn after arrival to that hospital. The Associate Administrator and Quality Coordinator reported that PHRMH staff started an investigation immediately and found that on 09/28/2014 at 0534 Patient 1 called his/her physician in Hood River with reports of loss of fluid and blood tinged mucus.  The physician directed Patient 1 to go the PHRMH for a ""labor check"" before driving to OHSU for a VBAC.  Patient 1 had an established birth plan to have a VBAC at OHSU as PHRMH does not provide VBAC by policy.  

The Associate Administrator and Quality Coordinator stated that medical staff bylaws permit a FBC RN to conduct the MSE for pregnant women.  They reported that Patient 1 arrived at PHRMH at 0610 and was checked by the FBC RN.  The RN assessed the patient to be 3 cm. dilated, 90% effaced, -2 station, with ruptured membranes, and FHTs in the 150s for ""3 to 4 mins"". During the time in the FBC the patient was requesting to leave the hospital to go to OHSU, was ""wanting to go AMA"". The RN called the physician who directed the RN to send Patient 1 to OHSU for the planned VBAC. Patient 1 left the hospital with his/her spouse in a private vehicle.  

During the interview it was confirmed that an appropriate transfer ""didn't happen"" as there was ""no MD to patient communication...no hospital to hospital communication...no RN to RN communication...nor did the RN complete transfer forms.""  They further reported that although Patient 1 was ""wanting to go AMA"", the patient was not presented with AMA forms to sign and there was no related documentation in Patient 1's medical record.

* The RN who cared for Patient 1 in the hospital's FBC on 09/28/2014 was interviewed on 10/03/2014 at 1610.  He/she stated that at 0600 (on 09/28/2014) he/she received a phone call from the MD who provided notice that Patient 1 was coming to the hospital. The RN related that the MD reported that his/her patient was coming in to the FBC to rule out ROM, and that the patient had a history of previous C-section and had a birth plan to have a VBAC at OHSU.  The MD provided orders for an Amnisure test and instructed the RN to call MD with result.

The RN stated that upon arrival at FBC the patient stated ""Can we make this quick"" and ""the baby is moving"".  The patient reported ""contractions every 15 minutes"" and stated that he/she wanted to go to OHSU.  The RN stated that he/she checked the patient's cervix, which was at 3 cm., and obtained a specimen for the Amnisure test. After the exam the patient was anxious to leave and asked if he/she could get dressed.  The RN stated that after the patient was dressed the RN observed the patient's pants were ""soaked"", and based on the smell and amount assessed the patient to have ""grossly ruptured"" membranes.  The RN reported that he/she contacted the MD by phone who directed the RN to ""discharge"" the patient to OHSU and ""send with a piece of paper"" to let OHSU know that the patient was ""grossly ruptured."" The RN reported he/she wrote on a ""sticky note"" the words ""grossly ruptured"" and the vaginal exam results of ""3 90% -2"".  The RN reported he/she gave the ""sticky note"" to the patient with instructions to give it to the staff at OHSU. The patient left the FBC at 0625 with his/her significant other who was at the bedside during the FBC visit. 

During the interview the RN stated that the patient wanted the FBC visit to be quick and that the patient ""did not want to be stuck in Hood River and wanted to be on [his/her] way to OHSU for the VBAC.""  The RN stated the patient was ""glad to be getting out of here.""  The RN confirmed that the only documentation sent with the patient was the ""sticky note"" and that no medical records were sent.  

During the interview the RN described an appropriate EMTALA transfer.  He/she stated that based on the RN assessment findings the physician would come in to the hospital to further evaluate the patient; the physician would call the other hospital to find out if the other hospital could accept the patient; there would have to be an RN to RN report; medical records would be printed and sent with the patient, including pre-natal records and labs; there would be an ambulance transport and the house supervisor would be contacted to help make those arrangements; and the appropriate transfer forms and documentation would have to be completed.  

3. The medical record of Patient 11 was reviewed. The ""Patient Demographics"" section of the record reflected that the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2005 with a chief complaint of ""Weakness, Dehydrated."" The documentation in the record reflected that the patient had an extensive history of abdominal surgeries, perforated bowel, bowel obstruction, and related surgeries and procedures.  In July 2014 he/she had ""several surgeries related to close and open abdominal wound using mesh and bilateral skin advancement flaps"" with subsequent debridement of necrotic skin in August 2014. The patient had been on TPN until 08/28/2014 and was continuing to receive wound treatments three times a week. As a result of a MSE conducted by an MD the patient was determined to have a bowel obstruction.

Patient 11 was transferred to OHSU on 09/06/2014 at 0045. Documentation on the electronic transfer form reflected that all aspects of an appropriate transfer were carried out except that the risks of the transfer were not individualized or patient specific. The risks were recorded as ""All transfers have the risk of traffic accidents, bad weather and/or road conditions as well as limitations of personnel and equipment during transport.  There is also potential for worsening of medical condition during transport resulting in possible disability and/or death...no other risks beyond those listed above are anticipated.""  

Mapquest reflects OHSU in Portland, Oregon is 65 miles and one hour and 11 minutes drive time from PHRMH in Hood River, Oregon.

.
Based on interviews, review of medical records and review of documents, the hospital failed to identify the appropriate transfer forms that were to be completed by staff and sent with each transferred patient for 6 of 9 patients (Patients #6, #7, #16, #19, #21 and #23) transferred.

Failure to identify required transfer forms for transferred patients places patients at risk for unmet care needs and results in incomplete documentation.

Findings included:

1. Record review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled, ""EMTALA/Patient Transfers,"" last reviewed date 03/08/18, did not show guidance regarding which forms were required to be completed when patients were transferred.

2. Record review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled, ""COBRA/EMTALA,"" reviewed 04/03/19, did not show guidance regarding which forms were required.

3. Record review of the medical records of patients who were transferred to other facilities showed:

a. Patient #6's medical record contained 3 different transfer forms.

b. Patient #7's medical record contained contained 1 transfer form.

c. Patient #16's medical record contained 3 transfer forms, much of which was illegible and/or incomplete.

d. Patient #19's medical record contained 1 transfer form.

e. Patient # 21's medical record did not contain documentation that the patient had received a triage. The record did contain 3 transfer forms, but 1 was for an ambulance company and did not belong to the hospital. 

f. Patient #23's medical record contained 1 transfer form.

4. On 12/12/19 at 10:36 AM, Investigator #1 interviewed the Manager of the Obstetrical (OB) Unit (Staff #3) about the forms used when transferring patients to other facilities.  Staff #3 provided copies of the forms used when patients were transferred from the OB unit.  The Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) (Staff #2) was present during the interview and stated that the Emergency Department (ED) did not use the same forms.

5. On 12/13/19 at 11:50 AM, Investigator #1 interviewed the ED Hospital Unit Coordinator (HUC) (Staff #8) about ED transfer forms. Staff #8 stated that the ED used three forms when patients were transferred to other facilities. Staff #8 found two forms but needed assistance to find the third form.

6. On 12/12/19 at 2:25 PM, Investigator #1 interviewed the CNO (Staff #2) about missing transfer documentation in the medical records.  The CNO confirmed the findings regarding missing documentation in the medical records of transferred patients.

Based on record review and interview, the facility failed to document the risks and benefits of driving in a private vehicle to another facility for a higher level of care, failed to contact the receiving facility prior to sending the patient and failed to complete a transfer form in 1 of 20 medical records reviewed of patients who presented with an emergent obstetrical condition (Patient #1).

Findings include:

The facility policy titled, ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Policy-NW WI (Northwest Wisconsin) Region,"" dated 10/19/2017, was reviewed on 2/4/2019 at 1:40 PM. The policy revealed in part, ""Transfer out: b. Transfer for Unstable Patients:  If the patient's medical needs for stabilization and further medical treatment exceed the capabilities of a (hospital system) Hospital and the transfer is in the medical interest of the patient (i.e.., the expected benefits of the transfer outweigh the risks of the transfer),...the patient will be transferred to an appropriate facility in accordance with the procedures outlined below...""  The policy goes on to describe the provider's responsibilities: explain risks and benefits, arrange transfer to a receiving facility, provide treatment within its capabilities, contact the receiving facility prior to arranging for transfer and verify acceptance, arrange for medical information to be sent to receiving facility, arrange for mode of transportation matching patient's clinical needs, complete the ""Physician Certification of Need for Transfer Medical Necessity Information"" form""

A review of Patient #1's medical record was conducted on 2/4/2019 at 2:00 PM accompanied by Nursing Supervisor D who confirmed the following findings per interview:  

A progress note dated 1/20/2019 at 3:36 AM written by Registered Nurse E revealed that Patient #1 called the OB (obstetric) department on 1/20/2019 around 3:00 AM stating that #1 lost the mucous plug and shortly after that heard a pop followed by quite a bit of leaking fluids and has continued to leak fluids.  ""Given pt's (patient's) EDC (estimated date of confinement-due date), explanation given on the possibility of having to transfer to (receiving hospital) for delivery.  Pt verbalized understanding.""

Patient #1 arrived to the OB unit (all emergent OB conditions are sent directly to the OB unit vs. the Emergency Department at this facility) on 1/20/2019 at 4:49 AM.  Registered Nurse E initiated the medical screening exam at 4:56 AM.  The following was completed: vital signs, hypertension assessment, cervical exam, amnisure test (test to check for amniotic fluid), external fetal monitor, and uterine activity assessment.

On 1/20/2019 at 5:50 AM Patient #1 was discharged    from the sending facility with the instruction from Registered Nurse E to go straight to (the receiving hospital).  Patient #1 left with a family member via private vehicle.  

On 1/20/2019 at 5:54 AM Nurse E called report to a nurse in the OB unit at the receiving hospital.

An interview with Nursing Supervisor D was conducted on 2/4/2019 at 2:10 PM.  Supervisor D stated, ""There is no transfer form.  There was a verbal ok with the plan of care...(Patient #1) was an outpatient.  There is no order to discharge.  (Patient #1) was considered an outpatient and as an outpatient (#1) was just given instructions after the MD (Medical Doctor) told the RN (Registered Nurse) what to do.  (Patient #1) was sent to (receiving hospital) because (sending hospital) doesn't keep patients less than 36 weeks (due to no neonatal intensive care unit for the care of pre-term babies).  (Patient #1) was discharged    by private vehicle.  Because the nurse and provider did not feel patient was in danger of giving birth imminently, a private vehicle was considered an appropriate mode of transportation.""

An interview with Doctor F was conducted on 2/5/2019 at 9:35 AM.  Doctor F stated, ""The patient came in for leaking fluids and felt a pop.  (Registered Nurse E) did the triage.  Ordered an amnisure.  The results were not back yet when (Nurse E) called.  (Nurse E) had put the patient on the tocometer (fetal monitor) and (Patient #1) was having some contractions but not feeling them.  I recommended delivery in (receiving hospital).  (Patient #1) was 2 centimeters and not feeling contractions.  We figured the amnisure was positive and decided to send (Patient #1) to (receiving hospital) for an assessment and possible induction.""

Patient #1 was ""discharged   "" from this facility and sent directly to the receiving hospital via private vehicle.  There was no documentation that a provider discussed risks and benefits of this decision.  There was no documentation that the receiving facility was contacted prior to Patient #1 being discharged    from the transferring facility.  A Physician Certification of Need for Transfer form was not completed.

Based on reviews of medical records, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) / Ambulance Report, Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) related Policies and Procedures and Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, and interviews, it was determined Jackson Hospital (Hospital # 1) failed to arrange an appropriate transfer of Patient Identifier (PI) # 1 and PI # 9, two patients determined to be a danger to self and/or others, by failing to arrange transfer after the Emergency Medical Screening was completed and the need for inpatient psychiatric treatment was identified, thereby, delaying stabilizing treatment for both PI # 1 and PI # 9. 

As a result of this deficient practice, PI # 1's and PI # 9's psychiatric treatment was delayed. This deficient practice affected PI # 1 and PI # 9, two of 29 sampled patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), and has the potential to affect all patients with emergency psychiatric conditions who present to the ED at Hospital # 1 and require transfer to another hospital for inpatient psychiatric treatment.    

There are no psychiatric services available at Hospital # 1.

Interviews - Hospital # 1:

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 14:27, the Emergency Department (ED) Case Manager (CM) / Resource Management, Employee Identifier (EI ) # 1, stated if a psychiatric patient is committed by the court, placement is pre-determined by the Probate Judge and the patient is medically cleared, the patient is discharged    from the ED to the custody of the sheriff for transport. When a patient is court ordered to treatment at Hospital # 2, Hospital # 1 does not complete a consent for transfer form.  

Regarding PI # 1, the ED CM said prior to the court commitment of PI # 1, she tried to find an appropriate hospital to accept PI # 1. Mental Health staff (non hospital employees) come to the ED to evaluate psychiatric patients at the request of Jackson Hospital. 

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 16:55, EI # 1, ED Case Manager (CM) stated when PI # 1 presented to the ED, the patient did not have a court petition. According to the CM, she spoke with (name of psychiatrist) at Hospital # 3, but he would not accept PI # 1 without a court petition. While the CM continued to find another hospital to accept the patient, she was informed by Probate Court that a petition had been filed for PI # 1. The CM received a call from the Sheriff's office advising they were coming to transport the patient to Hospital # 2. The CM stated Hospital # 1 does not consider a patient court ordered to treatment a transfer because the court makes arrangements to include ascertaining bed availability at the receiving facility, not the hospital. Hospital # 1 considers the patient as a discharge and they do not talk to the receiving physician or staff at the receiving facility. According to the CM, PI # 1's consent for transfer form was completed in error. PI # 1's disposition was considered a discharge of a probate court ordered/committed patient who was medically cleared. The CM said PI # 1 was not a transfer. Review of  PI#1 ' s Consent to Transfer Form dated 3/10/2015 revealed that PI#1 was transferred and not discharged   .

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 16:45, the ED Physician (EI # 2) who signed the Consent and Transfer Form for PI # 1 on 3/10/15, confirmed the accepting psychiatrist as the receiving physician at Hospital # 2. Regarding patients with court orders for treatment the physician said, ""We (Jackson Hospital) don't know where the patient is going. We haven't made the arrangements.""  

According to the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, ""The condition of all injured persons presenting to the Emergency Department of the hospital shall be determined and the patient ...referred to an appropriate facility as indicated. Appropriate transfer agreements must be confirmed with the receiving facility and practitioner prior to transfer.""

During an interview on 3/19/15 at 10:00, EI # 1, ED Case Manager, said if a patient has a court petition, the judge determines where the patient will be sent for treatment. ""We (Jackson Hospital) don't have an accepting MD. The patient is discharged    from the ED. We are following the judge's order.""  

During an interview on 3/10/15 at 11:00, the ED Charge Nurse (EI # 6) stated PI # 1 was court ordered to treatment at Hospital # 2. According to the charge nurse, the sheriffs who came to the ED to transport PI # 1, said the patient refused to get in their van and insisted that EI # 6 call an ambulance to transport the patient. 

The Charge Nurse stated, ""I don't call the hospital because (name of case manager) takes care of that."" The nurse said the RN assigned to PI # 1 ""attempted"" to call report about the patient to the charge nurse at Hospital # 2.  EI # 1 said she did not know the outcome of that call. However, the charge nurse said she received a call from from the charge nurse at Hospital # 2 and gave report about PI # 1. This communication is not documented in PI # 1's medical record. 

During an interview on 3/19/15 at 17:00, the ED Physician, EI # 3, responsible for PI # 1's medical screening examination on 3/10/15, stated because PI # 1 was admitted     after 17:00 the mental health evaluation was not done until the following morning. When asked if he spoke with the psychiatrist documented on the transfer consent form as the receiving MD at Hospital # 2 he said, ""Probably. I usually do."" 

During an interview on 3/20/15 at 10:25, the Assistant ED Manager (EI # 4) and the ED Manager (EI # 5) verified that no consent transfer form is required when a patient is court ordered to treatment at another hospital. The patient is discharged    to the custody of the sheriff responsible for transporting the patient. The use of the Consent and Transfer Form to transfer of PI # 1 to Hospital # 2 on 3/10 15 was a ""mistake."" According to the managers, there is no contact by Jackson Hospital with the MD at the receiving hospital because probate court arranges the transfer. 

Summary, PI # 1 arrived in the ED at Hospital # 1 on 3/10/15 at 00:32.  Although the ED physician determined the patient was ""cleared medically for psychiatric referral"" at 03:10, no arrangements were documented and/or made to transfer PI # 1 to a psychiatric facility. Although the ED physician responsible for PI # 1's medical screening documented the patient's care was transferred to (name of psychiatrist), no physician to physician communication is documented in the medical record as required according to Hospital # 1's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. The mental health evaluation was documented at 08:45, more than eight hours after the medical screening evaluation was completed and the need for psychiatric treatment was identified. Over sixteen hours after arrival at Hospital # 1, PI # 1 was transported to Hospital # 2, representing an inappropriate transfer and a significant delay prior to the transfer of this patient identified as high risk by Hospital # 1's ED staff.  
 

2. PI # 9 - Jackson Hospital (Hospital # 1):

PI # 9 arrived at Hospital # 1's Emergency Department (ED) via private vehicle on 3/15/2015 at 18:45. According to the Triage Report at 18:57, PI # 9 complained of visual hallucinations for one week.

3/16/15 at 13:45: Disposition: Transfer. ""Escorted to (Mental Health Facility) per...Sheriff.""

Psychiatric Problems: Depression, Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.

Plan: Psychosis, acute exacerbation. 

Patient is harm to others.

Disposition: Transfer.

Resource Management Note for PI # 9 dated 3/16/1015 at 09:42:

Pt. (PI #9) was evaluated by (Named Area Mental Health Authority) and it was determined inpatient psychiatric treatment needed, but patient unwilling to go for treatment. Mental Health Authority to petition probate court for involuntary commitment.  

Petition for Involuntary Commitment : 

PI # 9 has a history of psychiatric treatment with Named Mental Health Authority ... and has a previous diagnosis of Schizophrenic Disorder, Schizo-Affective Disorder, Schizo Affective Type. PI # 9 is currently at Jackson Hospital ER  (emergency room   ) and is refusing inpatient treatment...has delusional thinking regarding high school boys who are trying to fight (him/her). Has had very aggressive behavior at home, is preoccupied, disoriented to time and day and is seeing faces of people who are not there. The petitioner believes PI # 9 is a threat to self and others and is in need of treatment for stabilization. Without treatment PI # 9's condition will continue to worsen.    

In summary, PI # 9 received a Medical Screening Examination on 3/13/15 at 19:07 at Jackson Hospital's ED. The Physician determined the patient was psychotic and was a danger to others. There are no psychiatric services at Jackson Hospital. PI # 9 was evaluated by an outside psychiatric provider (Named Medial Health Authority - MAMHA) on 3/16/15 at 9:26 AM, fourteen hours and 26 minutes after the ED Physician determined the patient was a harm to others and ordered a psychiatric evaluation. Transfer of PI # 9 from the ED to (Mental Health facility) occurred on 3/16/15 at 13:45, 18 hours and 26 minutes after the Medical Screening Examination (MSE). This represents an inappropriate transfer and a significant delay prior to the transfer of PI # 9, a patient identified as a risk to harm others by Hospital # 1's ED staff.

The hospital failed to ensure their procedure titled, ""Transfer of an Unstable Patient to Another Facility after a MSE (Medical Screening Examination) was followed for PI # 9 on 3/15/2015 as evidenced by failing to:
1). Ensure the physician completed an Authorization and Consent for Patient Transfer Form (physician written certification for transfer).
2). Contact, confirm and document the receiving physician agreed to accept transfer of the patient (PI # 9); and
3). A report was given to the receiving hospital using the Authorization and Consent for Patient Transfer form.

During the Labor and Delivery (L & D) Unit-tour on 11/27/2018 and 11/28/2018, the surveyors observed the L & D Intake Department. All the patients presenting at the Intake Department were required to complete a hospital form titled 'OB Triage/Medical Screening' Form.

OB Triage /Medical Screening Form requires the pt. to complete the following:
""...Date; Time; Legal Name; Date of Birth (DOB); Social Security #; Home Phone #; Current Address; Have you been to an Abrazo Hospital before? OB Doctor; Due Date; Date of last period; Reason for visit today....""
 
The form also includes: ""...FOR YOUR SAFETY AND TO VERIFY PATIENT IDENTIFY: (sic) PLEASE PROVIDE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION AND INSURANCE CARDS WITH THIS FORM...If you have a Medical Emergency or are in Labor, you have the right to receive a Medical Screening Examination and necessary Stabilizing treatment/transfer, even if you cannot pay or do not have medical insurance...."" 

Employee #7 confirmed during an interview on 11/27/2018, that s/he remembered this case. S/he reported that every pt. is required to fill out the OB Triage /Medical Screening Form with name, DOB and reason for visit. Employee #7 stated, if the pt. cannot fill the form out, s/he would help them fill out. 
S/he identified that at that point in time, the unit was very busy; Triage was full; there were 3 patients who presented at once with same symptoms. S/he identified the 4th pt. came in and thought she was ""leaking fluid and complaining of pain."" The pt. saw the person before her go to the waiting room as OB triage was full. The pt. did not want to wait and asked how long the wait would be. She was told unsure, trying to move as fast as we can, maybe thirty minutes or less. Employee #7 identified that s/he asked pt. #1 to sign in; however, the pt. refused treatment and asked for a closer hospital. She asked for the (name of the receiving hospital) phone number. Pt. #1 called the receiving facility on her cell phone and spoke to the OB department. Employee #7 said that s/he tried to get the pt. to register to be seen; pt. declined and left.
  
Employee #4 confirmed during an interview on 11/28 and 11/29 that she was not present when the event occurred; however, when she interviewed Employee #7 it was reported that the pt. presented to the unit and waited to register. When it was her turn to register, the pt. asked ""how long is it going to be? (Probably, because she saw the pt. in front of her be escorted to the waiting room)."" 
The patient was told, ""We are moving quickly but it could be 30 minutes."" The pt. asked, ""where the next nearest hospital was?"" and she was told ""you can go to any hospital."" She was asked to register to be seen and the pt. refused to be registered and left the unit.

Employee #2 confirmed that the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form is a standard requirement for all patients who present to the L & D Department to fill out.
 
Both, Employee #5 & Employee #7 confirmed during private interviews that every pt. that presents to the L& D unit will fill out the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form, and that they never had a patient who didn't fill out the form. Both reported, the only time when the form is not filled out by the patient is when they are in active labor, and in that case the unit secretary would fill out the information on patient's behalf. The information from the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form is entered in the system, patient is registered and a label is generated with the patient's name, age, DOB, admin date. This label is included in the L & D log, for each pt.

However, there was no documentation that patient #1 was entered in the log, in accordance with the hospital's policy titled 'Care of the Obstetrical Patient', and Section 489.20(r)(3).

There was no documentation that the hospital staff followed the facility EMTALA policy related to required documentation in the Central log, or following the AMA policy related to refusal of treatment and leaving AMA (Against Medical Advice).

Based on review of the emergency room    (ER) Log, review of the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policy and procedure review, and interview, it was determined the facility failed to accurately and completely record Patient #25's ER  presentation into the ER  Log.  Failure to enter Patient #25's name into the ER  Log did not allow the facility to track Patient #25's presentation and treatment.  The failed practice affected Patient #25 and had the likelihood to affect all patients presenting to the ER.  Findings included:

A.  Review of Medical Staff Rules and Regulations under ""General Rules Regarding Emergency Services,"" on 07/23/19, showed, ""an appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency service and be incorporated into the patient's hospital record, if such exists. The record shall include: Adequate patient identification; Information concerning the time of the patient's arrival, means of arrival and by who transported ..."".

B.  Review of the facility's policy titled, ""Admission of Patient to Emergency Department, EMTALA Regulations,"" on 07/23/19, showed all patients must be logged in and a permanent record produced.

LPN #1 stated Patient #25 presented with chief complaint that she thought she was miscarrying. LPN #1 stated she did not remember the patient's name.

F.  On 07/23/19 at 10:35 AM, RN #2, who was working in he ER  on 07/23/19, was interiewed.  RN #2 stated he had no recolection of this incident.

G.  On 07/23/19 at 11:50 AM, RN #1 was interviewed via telephone.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 arrived at the ER  about one week ago through EMS.  RN #1 stated the ER  alerted the EMS crew that North Metro Medical Center was an inappropriate facility due to not having OB (obstetrics) services.  RN #1 stated EMS still brought Patient #25 in due to the patient's transportation home.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was in the ER  approximately one and a half minutes with profuse bleeding.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was transferred from the hospital bed to the EMS gurney with profuse bleeding noted on both beds.  RN #1 stated that EMS crew said, ""We need to move with her.""  RN #1 stated Patient #25 signed an AMA (Against Medical Advice) form.  RN #1 stated Patient #25's name was withheld from them so they could not register the patient.  RN #1 stated the AMA form was in his mailbox in the ER.  RN #2 stated he didn't know what to with it (AMA form).  RN #1 stated Patient #25 made the decision to go to another facility.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was not placed on the ER  Log because no name was given.

H.  On 07/23/19 at 12:20 PM Physican #1 was interviewed via telephone.  Physician #1 stated, to his understanding, Patient #25 signed an AMA form.  Physician #1 stated he did not touch the patient.  Physician #1 stated he had heard about the blood on the gurney and bed but he did not see it himself.  Physician #1 stated to his understanding she immediately stated she didn't want to stay.  Physician #1 stated he did not assess Patient #25.  Phsycian #1 stated Patient #25 signed an AMA form and he felt he couldn't legally touch the patient.

I.  The CEO retrieved the AMA form from RN #1's mail box in the ER  on 07/23/19.  The AMA form was signed on 07/17/19 at 11:05 AM.

Based on staff interview, Emergency Department (ED) record review, policy and procedure (P&P) and central ED log review, the hospital failed to maintain a central log on each individual who comes to the emergency department seeking assistance and document whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, or whether he or she was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   , for 1 of 20 patients reviewed (Patient 3).

Findings:

Review of Emergency Department's policy titled ""Register-Emergency Department "" (last revised 9/12) indicated the purpose was ""To ensure an accurate recording of all Emergency Department (ED) visits in a permanent register."" The policy directed that ""1. All patients who are registered to be seen in the ED shall be recorded in a permanent register. The T-system (electronic record system) generates a department log. 2. Such register shall contain: date, time of registration, patient name, address, age and sex, method of arrival, diagnosis, time of discharge, transfer or admission and treating physician."" The policy did not make a reference to any other ED logs in the hospital.

On 4/10/13 starting at 9 am, the Patient Care Executive stated that ED patient logs were maintained electronically. In addition to the ED log, there was Obstetrical (OB) Central Log  patient log maintained by the Family Birth Center in the Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit for all patients presenting to the L&D. The OB log was not maintained electronically. 

Review of the ""Obstetric (OB) Central Log"" showed that Patient 3 presented to the Family Birth Center, Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit, on 3/30/13 at 1:15 p.m. for decreased fetal movement. The log was blank in multiple areas for Patient 3's visit, including assessment/procedure section, length of stay, disposition and time and date of disposition. The OB central log did not indicate if patients presented to the L&D unit for routine (scheduled) care or for emergency (walk-in, unscheduled) care. Review of Patient 3's L&D record for 3/30/13 at 1:15 p.m. visit showed that Patient 3 presented unscheduled with complaint of decreased fetal movements and that the L&D nurse performed a Fetal Non-Stress test (NST) and the patient was discharged    home.

In an interview on 4/11/13 at 11 a.m. the L&D Manager and the ED Manager stated that patients who were pregnant 20 weeks or over were directed and provided a medical screening exam by an L&D RN per the ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE)"" policy when presenting unscheduled for pregnancy related emergency care. Those patients were logged in the Obstetric Central Log along with any other pregnant patients presenting to L&D unit for scheduled testing, such as routine NST and other appointments. The L&D Manager confirmed the OB log was incomplete for Patient 3. The L&D Manager confirmed that the OB log did not distinguish between emergency and non-emergency patients, and without looking at each patient's record, there was no way of telling which patients were emergency patients. The ED Manager stated that the OB log was not reviewed by the ED Department for emergency care.

At 9:47 a.m. the nurse's OB (obstetrics) triage note recorded the patient's level of consciousness as ""lethargy"". There was no record of the patient's blood pressure or heart rate in the record. The ""OB provider admission history and physical"" record did not include Patient 1's vital signs or address the lethargy.  On 1/15/12 at 10:20 a.m. Attending Physician A discharged    Patient 18 home without a review of vital signs or comment on the patient's lethargy.

Registered Nurse B (RN B) stated during a telephone interview on 1/17/12 at 12:15 p.m. she thought she had recorded the vital signs while she assessed Patient 1 in the examination room.  The medical record indicated the fetal monitor recorded the baby's heart rate but the strip did not include the mother's blood pressure and heart rate. 

Attending Physician A was interviewed on 1/13/12 at 2 p.m. and acknowledged there was no blood pressure or heart rate recorded in the patient's record.  The physician stated she would have asked for the vital signs if she had noticed they were missing but remained confident the patient was stable and there were no indications of potential changes in her medical condition.

During an interview on 1/13/12 at 10:20 a.m., the chief of obstetrics and gynecology (COOBG) stated he was notified by a physician at another local hospital, Patient 18 arrived by ambulance on 1/6/12 and died    in the receiving hospital's emergency room   . The COOBG acknowledged an MSE would include an examination of the patient and a review of vital signs. Although the patient's complaint was not unusual for their department, nursing and medical staff were required to document the MSE.  

2.  The record review on 3/7/12 indicated Patient 19 arrived in the emergency department on 1/25/12 at 4:25 p.m.  The labor and delivery drop in sheet (log) indicated the reason for the visit was decreased fetal movement.  The OB provider admission history and physical indicated Patient 19 was discharged    at 4:52 p.m. as stable without evidence the physician reviewed the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. 

According to the regulation individuals coming to labor and delivery for emergency visits must be provided an appropriate MSE.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to facilitate an appropriate transfer for one of four sampled transferred patients (Patient 10) when a Physician Certification & Authorization (physician signed certification of the risks and benefits of transfer) and a Patient Transfer Acknowledgement (consent) for Patient 10 were not available. This failure had the potential for Patient 10's responsible party to be unable to make informed decisions before consenting to the transfer.  

Findings:

During a concurrent interview and record review on 3/31/21, at 2:10 PM, with Clinical Informationist 2 (person skilled in the facility's electronic medical records), Patient 10's Emergency Department (ED) records, dated 1/18/21, at 8:30 AM, were reviewed. Patient 10's ""Emergency Documentation"" indicated the following:
Patient 10 was 4 years old, born prematurely at 31 weeks (A preterm or premature baby is delivered before 37 weeks of the pregnancy), had [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (a condition marked by impaired muscle coordination, typically caused by damage to the brain before or at birth), Infantile Spasm Seizures (burst of uncontrolled electrical activity between brain cells causing muscles in the arms and legs to stiffen and bend the baby's head forward), and asthma (swelling and narrowing of the airways [tubes] in the lungs). 
Patient 10 arrived by ambulance with mother for seizure-like activity and vomiting. Patient 10 received Versed (medication used to treat seizures) 0.37 milligrams (mg, unit of measurement) prior to arrival at the ED. In the ED, Patient 10 had full body tonic-clonic (type of seizure characterized by stiffening and rhythmic jerking) seizure activity. Patient 10 received an additional two doses of Versed 1.5 mg and Keppra (medication used to treat seizures). The facility pediatrician recommended Patient 10 transfer to a children's specialty hospital. 
Clinical Informationist 2 was unable to provide neither a Physician Certification & Authorization nor a signed Patient Transfer Acknowledgement for Patient 10.

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 10:50 AM, with Clinical Informationist 1 (CI) 1, CI 1 stated, transfer records should be located in the scanned documents; there was no other place the patient transfer documentation would be. 

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 2:37 PM, with ED Clinical Educator (EDCE), EDCE stated, the medical provider should provide a risk and benefit statement to the patient and document the discussion in the medical record.

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 4:30 PM, with Risk Management staff (RM), RM staff stated, she would contact medical records for the transfer records related to Patient 10's transfer.

During a review of a handwritten note, (undated) from RM staff, on 4/1/21, at 1:21 PM, the handwritten note indicated, ""Unable to locate [transfer] Forms.""

During a review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, approved 12/21/20, the Rules and Regulations indicated, EMTALA Transfers: (a) The transfer of a patient with an emergency medical condition from the Emergency Department to another hospital will be made in accordance with the District's applicable policy and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws, such as EMTALA. (b) Before any such transfer occurs, a physician must see the patient and enter a certification in the patient's medical record indicating that the medical benefits to be received at another medical facility outweigh the risk to the patient of being transferred. . .(4) provide the following information to the patient whenever the patient is transferred: (i) the reason for the transfer (ii) the risks and benefits of the transfer; and (iii) available alternatives to the transfer.""

During a review of the facility's policy and procedure (P&P) titled ""Compliance with EMTALA,"" approved 1/29/2020, the P&P indicated, [facility name] sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) available at the time of transfer related to the emergency condition of the patient, including;  ...b. the patient's informed written consent to transfer or the physician's certification (or copy thereof). The P&P indicated, the ""Physician Certification - The written certification by the treating physician ordering a transfer and setting forth, based on the information available at the time of transfer, that the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual ...""

During a review of the facility's P&P titled ""Compliance with EMTALA, Attachment B,"" approved 1/29/2020, Attachment B indicated, ""Patient Transfer Acknowledgement I understand that I have a right to receive...and that I have a right to be informed of the reasons for any transfer...and have been informed of the reasons for my transfer.""

During a review of the facility's P&P titled ""Compliance with EMTALA, Attachment B,"" approved 1/29/2020, Attachment B indicated, ""Physicians Certification & Authorization...Based on this examination, the information available to me at this time, and the reasonable risks and benefits to the patient, I have concluded for the reasons which follow that, as of the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of treatment at another facility outweigh any increased risks to the patient.""

During a review of the facility P&P titled ""Interfacility: Transfer, Access & Stabilization,"" approved 1/28/2020, the P&P indicated, ""Physician Certification of Medical Benefit...physician has signed a certification that, based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of emergency medical treatment at another facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual. . .the 'Physician Certification' (Form B), will be completed and signed by the physician. . .Accompanying Records and Documentation All of the following must be transferred with the individual: Copies of the individual's medical records. . .and the written informed consent or certification. . .Notice to Patient 1.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to consistently provide on-call coverage for the emergency department (ED) commensurate with services available at the hospital. The hospital had ten members (Providers 1 through 10) of its medical staff in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), nine of which (Providers 1 through 8, and 10) provided routine services at the hospital. Yet the on call schedule for the ED offered OB/GYN coverage only for trauma patients, and a reference sheet regarding the scope of the hospital's services for emergency transfers indicated OB/GYN was not provided. Two of 20 sampled patients (Patients 2 and 7) did receive non-trauma OB/GYN on-call coverage in the ED and one of 20 sampled patients (Patient 1) did not.

Findings:

Review of Patient 1's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 7/5/21 complaining of a fever, bleeding, and pain following a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) at Hospital C on 6/19/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 7/5/21 indicated, ""I discussed the case with the patient's surgeon [Physician B] who felt that the patient should be treated here at Regional Medical Center however we do not have gyn service on-call. I discussed with our CMO [chief medical officer]... who states that the patient should be transferred ER  [emergency room   ] to ER  to [Hospital C] where the patient had the initial surgery for this post op [post-operative] complication. This would be for higher level of care for Gyn services.""

Review of the physician on-call schedules provided by the hospital indicated the schedules for the OB/GYN service for January 2021 through July 2021 were labeled ""OB/GYN - TRAUMA ONLY"". No on-call schedule for non-trauma OB/GYN was provided.

Review of the ""Regional Medical Center Reference List"" (revised 4/14/21) indicated the document delineated dispositions for various types of patients being considered for transfer in to the hospital. The document indicated OB/GYN was not offered on an on-call basis and that such patients could be declined without escalating to the administrator on call since the service was not offered.

Review of the hospital's undated medical staff roster indicated there were ten members of the medical staff specializing in OB/GYN (Providers 1 through 10), and that Physician B was not a member of the medical staff at the hospital.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:04 p.m., the Director of Medical Staff (DMS) stated the OB service had been closed in April, 2020 and the case volumes of the OB/GYN medical staff had been nil since then. The DMS stated the call schedule for the emergency room    was maintained because of trauma. The DMS stated Provider 9 had ""ambulatory"" status on the medical staff, which was a status pertaining to clinic physicians who do not come to the hospital.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:26 p.m., the Quality Director of Clinical Excellence (QDCE) stated the OB service at the hospital was closed on March 30, 2020 because it was not financially viable due to too few patients. She stated the perinatal unit was taken off the hospital's license on 6/11/21.

Review of a letter from the California Department of Public Health to the QDCE dated 6/8/20 indicated the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the perinatal unit were removed from the hospital license effective 5/30/20.

Review of Provider 1's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 7/1/21 for a two-year term. Provider 1's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies (removal of the uterus through the vagina or the abdominal wall), laparascopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH, using a fiber-optic tube for part of the surgery), and total laparascopic hysterectomy (TLH, using fiber-optic tubes rather than traditional incisions for the surgery). Provider 1's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had performed 5 surgeries and admitted     8 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Provider 3's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 3's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 11 surgeries and admitted     1 inpatient at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 4's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 6/23/20 for a term expiring on 5/31/22. Provider 3's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 4's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had performed 11 surgeries at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 5's credentials file indicated he was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 11/7/19 for a term expiring on 10/31/21. Provider 5's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies, and LAVH. Provider 5's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 2 surgeries and admitted     15 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 6's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 4/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 6's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 6's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had not performed any surgeries or admitted     any inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 7's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 5/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 7's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies, LAVH, and TLH. Provider 7's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 11 surgeries and admitted     6 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 8's credentials file indicated he was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 2/25/20 for a term expiring on 1/31/22. Provider 8's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 8's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 6 surgeries at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 9's credentials file indicated she was a member of the medical staff in the ambulatory (outpatient) category, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 1/16/20 for a term expiring on 11/30/21. Provider 9's credentials file indicated she did not have privileges at the hospital.

Review of Provider 10's credentials file indicated he was a courtesy member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 6/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 10's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 10's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 7 surgeries and admitted     2 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:42 p.m., the DMS stated OBs were called in to the ED, not only for trauma patients. He stated the OB/GYNs on the medical staff were still doing hysterectomies at the hospital.

Review of Patient 2's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 1/26/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 1/26/21 indicated, ""SHE WAS SENT HERE BY HER OB/GYN TO RULE OUT MISCARRIAGE VERSUS [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]."" (In an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED], the embryo attaches outside the uterus. The fetus usually cannot survive, and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] can cause severe bleeding in the mother.) The provider note did not indicate Patient 2 had any traumatic injuries. The provider note indicated the ED provider consulted Provider 3, an OB/GYN on the hospital's medical staff.

Review of Patient 7's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 6/9/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 6/9/21 indicated ...Ob was consulted. Advised to initiate therapy for potential pre term labor..."" The provider report did not indicate Patient 7 had any traumatic injuries. The provider note indicated the ED provider consulted Provider 1, an OB/GYN on the hospital's medical staff.

In an interview on 7/21/21 at 10:57 a.m., the surveyor asked the QDCE to explain the inconsistent interviews and record reviews regarding OB/GYN on call coverage. The QDCE replied that to her knowledge, OB/GYN on call coverage was only for trauma, but she would have the chief medical officer (CMO) address the question.

In an interview on 7/21/21 at 11:23 a.m., the CMO stated OB provided trauma call for any pregnant trauma patient. She stated the labor & delivery unit at the hospital was closed on 5/3/20. Initially, the OB service supported any pregnant patient, but now on-call OB is only for OB trauma. The CMO stated the hospital has OB/GYNs on its medical staff, who bring patients to the hospital to have surgical procedures, and those patients may be admitted    , but the OB/GYNs do not take calls. Regarding Patient 1, the CMO stated anyone who operates cares for their own patients for the first 30 days after surgery. The CMO acknowledged Patient 1's surgeon, Physician B, was not on the medical staff at the hospital, and stated Physician B would not have seen the patient, so the hospital would triage and transfer such a patient. The CMO stated the physicians who had covered the labor and delivery unit had resigned, and the remaining members of the medical staff did not provide consultations on inpatients. When the surveyor asked why Patients 2 and 7, who were not trauma patients, had OB consults while they were in the ED, the CMO replied that OB helps the ED out of courtesy, but they are not on call.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to ensure one of 20 patients' (Patient 1) medical records contained a physician certification (a documentation indicating that a physician certifies the expected medical benefits of the transfer outweigh the increased risks that results from being transferred) or document specifying the expected benefits of the transfer and risks associated with the transfer. This failure had a potential to deprive patients of information necessary to make informed decisions about their treatment and transfer and could cause an unnecessary transfer with unspecified reasons of the transfer. 

Findings:

Review of Patient 1's Emergency Provider Report, dated 7/5/21, indicated the patient was a [AGE]-year-old female, with past history of hysterectomy (surgery to remove a woman's uterus [the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant]) on 6/19/2 in Hospital C, and presented to the ED (emergency department) complaining of bleeding from the post-op (postoperative) site on the abdomen and associated abdominal pain.

On the same report, Review of Free Text MDM (Medical Decision Making) Notes indicated at 2:58 p.m., Physician A re-evaluated Patient 1 and ""some pus was also expressed from the wound."" Physician A discussed Patient 1's care with Patient 1's surgeon in Hospital C, ""who felt that the patient should be treated here at [the hospital name] however we do not have gyn [gynecology, the branch of physiology and medicine which deals with the functions and diseases specific to women and girls, especially those affecting the reproductive system] service on-call."" It indicated Physician A discussed  with the chief medical officer (CMO) and the CMO stated the patient should be transferred to Hospital C where the patient had the initial surgery for the post-op complication and ""this would be for higher level of care for Gyn services."" At 5:30 p.m. Physician A discussed the case with a doctor who accepted the patient in transfer to Hospital C for higher level of care for gynecology services. There was no documentation regarding the expected medical benefits and risks associated with transfer and/or whether the benefits outweighed the risks.  

Review of Patient 1's Emergency Patient Record, dated 7/5/21, indicated at 7:10 p.m. Patient 1 was transferred to Hospital C. There was no physician certification indicating the physician certified that the expected benefits of the transfer outweighed the risks.

Review of the hospital's Memorandum of Transfer, a transfer form utilized in the hospital, indicated the form certified the risk and benefits of the transfer, verification of health records being sent, accepting physician, and certification whether the patient was in stable condition. 

During an interview on 7/19/21 at 2:10 p.m., Quality Director of Clinical Excellence (QDCE) stated when a patient is transferred to another hospital, the physician has to fill the form, Memorandum of Transfer. She reviewed Patient 1's medical records and stated Patient 1's record did not contain Memorandum of Transfer form.

Review of the hospital's policy, ""EMTALA-CALIFORNIA TRANSFER POLICY"", dated 11/2016, indicated any transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition must be initiated either by a written request for transfer from the individual or the legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, or by a physician order with the appropriate physician certification as required under EMTALA. It indicated a physician must sign an express written certification that, based on the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual. The certification should meet the following requirements: 1) The certification must state the reason for transfer. The narrative rationale need not be a lengthy discussion of the individual's medical condition as this can be found in the medical record but should be specific to the condition of the patient upon transfer. 2) The certification must contain a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time away from an acute care setting necessary to effect the transfer. 3) The date and time of the physician certification should closely match the date and time of the transfer. 4) Certifications may not be backdated. It further indicated a Memorandum of Transfer must be completed for every patient who is transferred to anther separately licensed hospital. A copy of the Memorandum of Transfer shall be retained by the transferring hospital and incorporated into the patient's medical record.    

Review of the hospital's policy,""EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT TRANSFER PROCESS"", dated 4/9/31, indicated the physician completes the Physician Section of the Memorandum of Transfer (MOT) form after reviewing all ordered tests and treatments and stabilizing the patient and certifies the patient status for transfer by signing the certification. The primary care nurse completes the nursing section of the MOT form.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to ensure that seven of 10 sampled  emergency department (ED) patients (Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16) who required transfer to a higher level of care for an Emergent Medical Condition (EMC) met the requirements for an appropriate transfer as follows:

1.  Patients 7, 8, 9 and 10's ""Physician Certification"" emergency transfer form was not properly authenticated with a date and time of the physician's signature.

2.  Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16's, ""Physician Certification"" did not contain: 
*  A description of the higher level of medical services that would cause the patient to benefit from the transfer,
*  The medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of the medical services available at the receiving facility, and that those benefits outweigh the increased risks to the individual from being transferred, and
*  A summary of the risks and benefits upon which the certification was based.

3.  Patients 7, 8, and 10's, ""Physician Certification"" form contained information that indicated the patients had been transferred using non-qualified personnel and transfer equipment

These failures have the potential for patients to have delays in receiving needed care and inappropriate transfers to another facility which could result in adverse outcomes including death.


Findings:

1.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 7 was reviewed.  Patient 7 was seen in the ED on 5/7/14 beginning at 7:37 pm with an initial complaint that she had thoughts of harming herself.  In the ED, a Medical Screening Examination (MSE) showed Patient 7 did have an emergency medical condition and was at risk of harming herself.  Patient 7 had previously been found unable to care for herself and placed under conservatorship.  Patient 7's conservator was contacted and arrangements were made to transfer Patient 7 to a psychiatric care facility. 

On 5/9/14 at or near 9:50 am, Patient 7 was transferred to the psychiatric facility for definitive care.  Patient 7's record contains a ""Physician Certification (for Emergent Transfer)"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate notes Patient 7 was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first and last name of an individual was listed.  There was no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

2.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 8 was reviewed.  Patient 8 was brought to the ED on 5/2/14 at 10:43 am by local law enforcement officers with the history of threatening others and himself.  In the ED, a MSE of Patient 9 showed he did have an emergency medical condition and was at risk of harming himself and others.  Because of this, Patient 8 was placed on involuntary psychiatric hold (5150) and plans were made to transfer him to psychiatric care specialty facility in a distant community. 

At 4:55 pm on 5/2/14, Patient 8 was transferred to the distant psychiatric care facility.  Patient 8?s record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate noted Patient 8 was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first name of an individual is listed.  There was no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

3.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 9 was reviewed.  Patient 9 was seen in the ED on 5/3/14 beginning at 2:47 pm with an initial complaint that she thought she had had a seizure.  Patient 9's MSE found that she did have a EMC and arrangements were made to send her to a medical center and physician where she had recently had some neurological (pertaining to nerves) specialty care.

At 4:55 pm on 5/3/14, Patient 9 was transferred to be admitted     by her neurologist (Physician specializing in nerve function) at a local medical center.  Patient 9's record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

4.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 10 was reviewed.  Patient 10 was brought to the ED on 5/4/14 at 1:38 am by local law enforcement officers with the history of being ""paranoid"" (a mental condition in which one falsely believes others are trying harm them).  Patient 10's MSE was not clearly delineated but concludes with ""Medically cleared and given (two medications) will be released and clearing her to a 5150.""  The phrase ""5150"" refers to a state legislative statute regarding patients that need to be involuntarily held for psychiatric care because they are a danger to themselves or others.  The record does not otherwise specify the reason for transfer or other specifics related to the care to be received at the receiving facility.

At 11:26 pm on 5/4/14, Patient 10 was transferred to the distant psychiatric care facility.  Patient 10's record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate notes the patient was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first name of an individual was listed.  There is no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

5.  A review of Patient 11's record indicated she was seen in the ED on 5/11/14 beginning at 3:15 pm with an initial complaint of abdominal pain following a VP shunt surgery. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is surgery to treat excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ([DIAGNOSES REDACTED]).  Patient 11's surgeon was contacted and requested a transfer to a higher level of care for evaluation.  Patient 11's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" for transfer that did not contain the reasons for transfer and was not signed by Patient 11 but instead signed by the physician.  Patient 11's record indicated that she was alert and oriented and did not have conditions which precluded her from signing the transfer form.  Patient 11's record also indicated that she had a family member present in the ED that could have signed for Patient 11 if she was unable to do so.

6.  On 6/3/14, Patient 15's record was reviewed.  Patient 15 was seen in the OB (obstetrical - for birthing) unit and found to have pre-eclampsia (a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure to both the mother and the fetus).  Patient 15's physician provided stabilizing treatment and arranged for transfer to a hospital with a higher level of care.  Patient 15's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" that did not include a detailed summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.

7.  On 6/3/14, Patient 16's record was reviewed.  Patient 16 was admitted on [DATE] in labor.  Patient 16 had been scheduled for a Cesarean section (delivery of the infant via the abdomen) at a hospital with a higher level of care on 1/23/14 due to fetal omphalocele (a high risk condition in which the stomach and other organs are on the outside of the body).  Patient 16's physician provided stabilizing treatment and arranged for transfer to the hospital above. Patient 16's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" that did not include a detailed summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.

On 6/4/14, the hospital's policy, titled, ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act,"" dated 7/7/11, was reviewed.  The policy instructed the physician to complete the certification form but did not detail the required elements of a complete physician certification.

On 6/4/14 between 9:45 and 10:30 am, Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16 were concurrently reviewed with the hospital's Vice-President of Medical Affairs (VPMA), and he acknowledged and concurred with the findings listed above.

VPMA also provided information about the two individuals that provided the transfer transportation for Patients 7, 8 and 10.  VPMA indicated these drivers were provided by a local mental-health care organization with which the hospital has an agreement.  This agreement or ""memorandum of agreement"" (MOU) was obtained and reviewed.  The MOU did not provide any information about the transfer services outlined above or the drivers that the organization provided.  The agreement did not have language that specified the mental-health care organization would ensure the provision of services that would allow the hospital to be in compliance with any regulations.  The VPMA stated that the hospital had no information to show that these drivers had received any specific training, were bonded or had other qualifications that would indicate they could provide appropriate and safe transportation for mental patients and/or patients that could be a danger to themselves or others.  The VPMA indicated that he understood the hospital was responsible for ensuring that emergent transfer services and all services provided by agreement are safe and effective.

Based on observation, interview, and record review, Facility A failed to comply with CFR 489.24, by failing to: 

1. a. Ensure a medical screening exam, (MSE-the process of determining whether an emergency medical condition exists) was completed for one pregnant patient, (Patient 1), who presented to the Emergency Department (ED). This failure resulted in the patient being taken to another facility for treatment at the risk of delivering the infant en route. (Refer to A 2406),

   b. Ensure a MSE was completed for Patient 2, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain and cold sweats. (Refer to A2406),

   c. Ensure a MSE was completed for Patient 6, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of hearing voices and having suicidal ideations. (Refer to A 2406) and;

2. Ensure Registered Nurse (RN) 10, was qualified to perform the MSE as required per Hospital Rules and Regulations, and facility policy. RN 10, who performed an MSE on a pregnant patient (Patient 17), did not have demonstrated competencies verified prior to performing a MSE. (Refer to A 2406).

_x000d_
Based on observation, interview, and record review, the facility (Facility A), failed to maintain an accurate central log for the Emergency Department (ED). The ED Central Log did not contain the name and disposition of one obstetric (OB) patient (Patient 1), who presented on   January 5, 2016, seeking assistance. As a result the facility was unable to track the care provided to Patient 1.

Findings:

On January 12, 2016, the record for Patient 1, obtained from Facility B, was reviewed. The record contained a copy of the ""OB Patient Registration Form,"" from Facility A. The Registration Form indicated Patient 1 presented to Facility A on January 5, 2016, at 1:45 a.m., with complaints of, ""A lot of pain/ pressure in lower stomic (stomach).""

On January 12, 2016, at 11:15 a.m., an unannounced visit was made to Facility A. The ED and OB Central Logs were reviewed. Patient 1 was not listed on either log.

On January 12, 2016, at 3 p.m., a copy of the ED security video for January 5, 2015, was reviewed with the Director of Security (DS) and the Director of Quality Services. The DS stated the time stamp on the video was 34 minutes fast. The video revealed the following:

- At 2:19 a.m. (actual time 1:45 a.m.), a man and a woman (who appeared to be pregnant) entered the ED. The security guard gave the woman paperwork to fill out, and assisted the woman into a wheelchair. The woman was next observed filling out the paperwork.

- At 2:24 a.m. (1:50 a.m.), the man handed the paperwork to a staff member (Patient Access Representative 1) observed sitting behind a semi circular desk in the lobby.

- At 2:27 a.m. (1:53 a.m.), Patient Access Representative (PAR) 1 gave the paperwork back to the couple and they went to sit in the waiting area.

- At 2:28 a.m. (1:54 a.m.), the man went back to the desk to talk to PAR 1.

- At 2:32 a.m. (1:58 a.m.), the man assisted the pregnant woman from the wheelchair and the couple left the ED.

On January 13, 2016, at 10:53 a.m., the Director of Patient Access (DPA) was interviewed. The DPA stated when an OB patient presented to the ED the PAR would do a quick registration on the patient and enter the patient into the computer. She stated at that time the patient's name would appear on the tracking board (electronic central log). The DPA stated if a patient left without being seen (LWBS) or left without being triaged (LWBT), the patient would still be on the electronic log, but be listed as LWBS or LWBT, so that it could be tracked.

On January 13, 2016, at 11:20 a.m., PAR 1 was interviewed. PAR 1 stated she was not a nurse and her job was not clinical. PAR 1 stated it was her job to register patients as they came in to the ED. However, PAR 1 stated,  if it was an OB patient, then she would not register them unless she knew for sure that the patient was going to have a baby. 

PAR 1 stated she would review the paperwork, to make sure everything was filled out, and then call the OB Department to report to them that an OB patient would be coming soon. She stated after the patient was seen in the OB department, then they would fax the registration form back to the PAR on duty, and the patient would be entered into the computer at that time.

PAR 1 stated she worked the night shift on January 5, 2016. PAR 1 stated she remembered Patient 1 and her boyfriend presented on   that night. PAR 1 stated Patient 1's boyfriend complained that Patient 1 was overdue and they hoped that she could be induced. PAR 1 stated she did not register Patient 1 into the computer, because she did not know if Patient 1 would be admitted     or not. PAR 1 stated she remembered that at some point Patient 1's boyfriend informed her that they were going to go to another hospital, and they left. PAR 1 added, it's the patients choice if they want to go somewhere else.

Based on interview and record review, the facility (Facility A) failed to comply with CFR 489.24 by failing:

1. To ensure an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) occurred, and was documented, for three of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patients 1, 4, and 14). This resulted in Patient 1 leaving the facility and being transferred to Facility B without a MSE, Patient 4 leaving the Labor & Delivery (L&D) Unit without a MSE, and Patient 14 being seen in L&D without documented evidence a MSE was done by a provider (Refer to A2406);

2. To ensure stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of the facility was provided prior to two of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patients 1 and 4) being directed to go to either Facility B or Facility C. This resulted in the facility not knowing if Patients 1 and 4 were in a stable condition in order to be discharged    or transferred to other acute care facilities (Refer to A2407); and 

3. To ensure the transfer of one of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patient 1) occurred in a safe manner when Patient 1 was not provided a medical screening examination, was not determined to be in a stable condition prior to being transferred to Facility B, and was transferred via private vehicle by a family member to Facility B (25.2 miles away from Facility A). This had the potential to result in harm or death to Patient 1 and her infant (Refer to A2409).

Based on interview and record/document review, Hospital A failed to maintain documented evidence of an appropriate inter-facility transfer for 6 of 21 sampled patients (1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 12).  Documentation of Patient 1's re-assessment after a change of condition, a transfer summary report and evidence of informed consent for the transfer were not available in the patient's medical record. In addition, Patient 2, Patient 5 and Patient 11's transfer summaries and informed consent for transfer were not available in the patients' medical records. In addition, Patient 8 and Patient 12's transfer summaries were not available in the patients' medical record. The omission of the patients' transfer summaries and informed consents, failed to ensure evidence of the required physician attestation of patient stability, informed consent and appropriateness for the inter-facility transfers.  

Findings:  

1. Patient 1 was admitted     to Hospital A's Emergency Department (ED) via paramedics on 12/24/15 at 7:34 A.M. per the Assessment History Report. Patient 1's family members stated the the patient was observed with new onset difficulty speaking and weakness. A ""Code Stroke"" protocol (a specific set of laboratory, radiology and neurological screening examinations used in the diagnosis and treatment a suspected stroke, which is an emergent brain disorder which can cause permanent disability and/or death) was initiated upon the patient's arrival in the ED.

During an interview and joint record review, on 2/2/16 at 11:30 A.M., Medical Doctor (MD) 2 recalled Patient 1 and  reviewed Patient 1's ED progress notes, dated 12/24/15. MD 2 stated that he examined the patient upon the patient's arrival in the ED. MD 2 stated Patient 1 was aphasic (unable to speak) and demonstrated decreased right sided grip strength. MD 2 stated that a head CT (computerized tomography; a specialized radiology examination used in the diagnosis of brain disorders) was completed and reviewed by the neurologist (physician specialist in nerve and brain disorders). MD 2 stated that Patient 1's aphasia and grip improved after the CT and during the on call neurologist examination. MD 2 stated that he consulted with a physician at the patient's HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) primary care hospital (Hospital B), ""felt the patient was stable"" and proceeded with transfer arrangements (prior to 10:00 A.M.).  MD 2 recalled registered nurse (RN) 1 reported an increased facial droop and change in condition ""around 10 am"". MD 2 stated he re-examined the patient and spoke to the patient/family members, but acknowledged that he did not document the patient re-examination or the discussion with the patient/family members regarding the risks/benefits of the planned transfer. In addition, MD 2 stated that he had not communicated or re-consulted,with the on call neurologist, after the reported re-occurrence of the patient's symptoms.

During an interview and joint record review of nurse notes, on 2/3/16 at 7:45 A.M., RN 1 recalled Patient 1 and reviewed nurse notes, dated 12/24/15.  RN 1 stated that Patient 1 was admitted     as a ""Code Stroke"" and that he was assigned to the patient throughout the patient's ED visit. RN 1 stated that the patient's initial aphasia and right sided weakness improved after the patient returned from the initial CT exam, at approximately 8:17 A.M.  RN 1 stated he then conducted a nursing assessment, assisted with the on call neurologist consultation and monitored the patient's status. RN 1 stated Patient 1's family members stated the patient was ""nearly back to normal around 9:30"".  RN 1 stated at 10:03 A.M., he informed MD 2 of  the patient's ""reappearing symptoms, right side weakness, and return of facial droop.""  RN 1 stated he conducted a nursing re-assessment, but acknowledged that he did not document the re-assessment in the patient's medical record.  RN 1 acknowledged that the next nursing note documentation occurred at 11:32 A.M. The nursing documentation indicated that the patient was transferred at ""1215 (12:15 P.M.)"" to the patient's primary care hospital.  RN 1 acknowledged that the nursing notes did not include further nursing assessments or vital sign documentation after the change in the patient's condition at 10:03 A.M.  

During an interview on 2/3/16 at 8:00 A.M., the Emergency Department Director (EDD) stated a handwritten ED Transfer Form should be completed on each patient transferred from the hospital ED to other facilities. The EDD stated the ED Transfer Form provided information regarding the patient condition at the time of discharge/transfer and included both nursing and physician summaries. The EDD stated Patient 1's ED Transfer Form was not available for review as it could not be located in Patient 1's medical record. 

During a record review on 2/22/16 at 2:00 P.M., Patient 1's medical record at Hospital B was reviewed.  Patient 1 was admitted on [DATE] at 12:23 P.M. after arriving by Critical Care Transport (CCT).  A ""Stroke Code"" was also initiated on Patient 1 at Hospital B. The nursing assessment dated    /timed 12/24/16 at 12:37 P.M., included the presence of right sided weakness, aphasia and right sided facial drooping. A review of Hospital B's neurology consultation note, dated 12/24/15 at 1:13 P.M., included ""[Patient 1] presented with right sided weakness, facial droop and slurred speech...resolved at 0930 (9:30 A.M.)...started again at about 1030 (10:30 A.M.)...Symptoms worsened in the ambulance.""  In addition, Patient 1's ED Transfer Form, initiated at Hospital A, was found at Hospital B and reviewed. The Physician Summary area on the ED Transfer Form had not been completed in a thorough manner and omitted information such as a diagnosis and physician orders for transport. The Physician Summary included a checklist for ""Reason for Transfer (include risk and benefit)"" and ""Insurance Request"" checkbox had been marked with an ""x"".  An area on the form for the physician's signature attestation for the transfer had been left blank. In addition, the Nursing Summary area on the ED Transfer Form had not been completed with regard to patient/representative transfer acknowledgements, hand off report to the receiving facility and the time of recorded vital signs. Furthermore, an attached Transfer Consent form, which indicated a patient/representative acknowledgment of explanation and acceptance of the transfer, had been left blank and unsigned.     

An interview with MD 3 was conducted on 2/24/16 at 8:30 A.M. MD 3 stated he was the Tele-neurologist on call and consulted by MD 2 (the Emergency Department physician) when Patient 1 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) , on 12/24/15, with symptoms of a stroke.  MD 3 stated that since Patient 1 had unknown onset of her stroke symptoms greater than 4 hours and that Patient 1's head CT (computed tomogram - a scan of the brain) was negative for bleeding or blockage of large vessels, that Patient 1 would not be a candidate for TPA (tissue plasminogen activator- a medicine that breaks down blood clots).  MD 3 stated his management plan was that Patient 1 was stable for transfer to a hospital that was part of Patient 1's HMO insurance plan for further management.  MD 3 stated that during his evaluation of Patient 1 that he observed her to ""wax and wane"" or slightly improve and worsen in her stroke symptoms; however MD 3 stated that Patient 1 did not have worsening symptoms than when Patient 1 presented to the ED. MD 3 stated that he did not have an expectation that the hospital would contact him if Patient 1 had slightly worsening symptoms as this was normally seen in this type of stroke patient. However, MD 3 stated  that determination would be dictated  by the hospital polices.  MD 3 acknowledged that MD 2 should have documented an examination of Patient 1 after the reported change of condition and prior to transfer and that MD2 should have signed the physician attestation that Patient 1 was stable for transfer.
A second interview with MD 2 was conducted on 2/24/16 at 9:20 A.M.  MD 2 stated he was the Emergency Department (ED) physician who provided care for Patient 1.  MD 2 stated Patient 1 presented with signs and symptoms of a stroke and that the onset of these symptoms was unknown, but greater than the 4 hour window to treat with TPA. MD 2 stated that he consulted MD 3 who was the tele-neurologist on call and that MD 3 advised him to obtain an emergent CTA (computerized tomography angiogram- a scan of the brain and blood vessels) which was negative for any blockage of large blood vessels. MD 2 stated that MD 3 advised him that Patient 1 would be stable for transfer to a hospital that is part of her HMO health insurance plan for further management. MD 2 stated that prior to transfer of Patient 1 that he was notified by RN 1 that Patient 1 was developing facial droop and right sided weakness and that MD 2 examined Patient 1 but he did not document his physical assessment of Patient 1. MD 2 stated he did not consult MD 3 about Patient 1's worsening of stroke symptoms because Patient 1's symptoms were not worse than her ""baseline"" or level of presenting symptoms. MD 2 stated that Patient 1 was still not a candidate for the TPA treatment and the minor worsening of symptoms would not change the plan for transfer. MD 2 stated he discussed the transfer with Patient 1's family and that the family was in agreement, however, MD 2 stated that he did not document his conversation with the family. MD 2 acknowledged that he should have documented his physical examination of Patient 1 after the change in her condition prior to transfer. MD 2 also acknowledged that he should have documented his conversation with Patient 1's family regarding the transfer. MD 2 stated he did not recall whether he signed the physician attestation that Patient 1 was stable for transfer.

POLICY

According to the facility's policy Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), Treatment and Transfer of Individuals with Emergency Medical Conditions, the hospital shall send the receiving facility copies of all pertinent medical records available at the time of transfer, including, a copy of the completed applicable sections of the transfer form. The transfer shall be effected through appropriately trained professionals and transportation equipment, including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during transfer.

1. The facility utilized a two page EMTALA Transfer Form for OB patients and, in review of 12 medical records of patients transferred from the OB department to a higher level of care, 10 of the forms were not completed in entirety and inclusive of critical information.

a) Review of the medical record for Patients #1, #4, #5, #6, #9, #10 and #12 revealed the patients were OB patients transferred emergently to a hospital with a higher level of obstetric/neonatal care. The EMTALA transfer form contained no documentation in the following areas: name of individual who received report at the destination hospital (as well as date/time report called), and the entire portion of transportation section, including transport agency, who accompanied the patient and what life support measures were required.

b) Review of the medical record for Patients #2 and #11 revealed the patients were OB patients transferred emergently to a hospital with a higher level of obstetric/neonatal care. The EMTALA transfer form contained no  documentation in the following areas: name of individual who received report at the destination hospital (as well as date/time report called).

Based on review of the facility's policies/procedures, facility document review, staff interview, and medical record review the facility failed to maintain a complete central log on each individual who came to the emergency department, as defined in ?489.24(b), seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, or whether he or she was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   . Specifically, the facility failed to record Sample Patient #1 into the emergency department's log and failed to ensure that the logs for the emergency department and obstetrics department were complete.

The findings were:

A review of the facility's policy titled, ""EMTALA Guidelines for Emergency Department Services"" last revised 3/2008 stated the following, in pertinent parts:
""...Medical Screening Exams:
Medical Screening Exams should include at a minimum the following:
?Emergency Department Log entry including disposition of patient
?Patient's triage record
?Vital signs
?History
?Physical exam of affected systems and potentially affected systems
?Exam of known chronic conditions
?Necessary testing to rule out emergency medical conditions
?Notification and use of on-call personnel to complete previously mentioned guidelines
?Notification and use of on-call physicians to diagnose and/or stabilize the patient as necessary
?Vital signs upon discharge or transfer
?Complete documentation of the medical screening exam ..."" 

A review of the facility's Emergency Department and Obstetrical Department's logs that were used to satisfy the requirements at 489.20 revealed that Sample patient #1 was not included in the log. Also the logs for both departments were noted to have incomplete entries which included the absence of dispositions of some of the patients.

A review of the facility's Emergency Department's log revealed that the following entries were incomplete:
Sample patient #8's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #9's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. 
Sample patient #10's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #11's entry from 1/30/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #12's entry from 1/31/2012 did not have a discharge disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #13's entry from 2/1/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #14's entry from 2/1/2012 did not have information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #15's entry from 2/1/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.

An interview with the facility's Director of the Emergency Department on 4/12/2012 at approximately 2:45 PM revealed that the logs provided to the surveyors were the logs that the facility used to satisfy the requirements of this section. S/he confirmed that the log was incomplete and that it did not include Sample patient #1.

An interview with the facility's Director of Obstetrics on 4/12/2012 at approximately 2:00 PM  revealed that there was one log used to capture all patients presenting to the obstetrics department. S/he reviewed the log titled ""OB Log"" and stated that all admissions, transfers, and discharges for the department would be documented on this log. The Director of Obstetrics stated that the logs are typically completed by technicians and are not audited by staff. S/he confirmed that the log had missing information as to discharge of patients from the department.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to maintain a central log that contained accurate information regarding disposition and transfer of patients who had received treatment in the Emergency Department (ED) for 5 of 18 ED records reviewed (Patients #4, #6, #17, #19 and #20).

Findings:

POLICY

According to the policy, titled Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act (EMTALA), a central log must list each individual seeking or in need of emergency services that comes to the hospital. The log must include an indication whether the individual did not consent to treatment or transfer, or was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   .  

1. The facility failed to maintain a complete and accurate central log of patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED), including an accurate record of patients that were admitted    , transferred or discharged   . 

a) Review of the EMTALA log, dated 08/21/16, revealed Patient #6 presented to the ED at 2:48 p.m. with a headache and eloped from the ED at 5:35 p.m. on 08/21/16. 

However, review of Patient #6's medical record showed the patient's father received discharge instructions at 5:30 p.m. and the patient was discharged    home. According the the ED Patient Discharge, dated 08/21/16 at 5:35 p.m., Registered Nurse #21 (RN) documented the patient was discharged    home with his/her family. This was in contrast to the EMTALA centralized log which noted the patient eloped.

On 08/24/16 at 10:35 a.m. an interview and record review for Patient #6 was conducted with the ED Nurse Manager (Manager #5).  Manager #5 reviewed the record and acknowledged the patient was discharged    home on 08/21/16 and did not elope. S/he stated the unit secretary would have looked for the correct disposition for Patient #6 on 08/22/16 and should have corrected it if it was inaccurate.

b) Review of the central (EMTALA) log showed Patient #4 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 4:48 p.m. for pregnancy problems.  

There was no documentation on the central log to indicate if the patient was treated, transferred, admitted     or discharged   . Specifically, the area for documenting the clinical impression, disposition and disposition date and time was left blank. 

c) Review of the EMTALA log for 08/16/16 showed Patient #17 presented at 5:46 p.m. for abdominal pain and was diagnosed    with appendicitis.  However, there was no disposition on the central log.

Review of Patient #17's Emergency Department Report, dated 08/16/16, revealed the patient had appendicitis and was to be admitted     to general surgery. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and was discharged    home on 08/17/16 at 9:15 a.m.

d) Similar findings were noted for Patients #19 and #20 regarding the facility's failure to note the disposition on the central EMTALA log.

e) An interview was conducted with Manager #5 and the Director of Critical Care & ED (Director #6) on 08/24/16 beginning at 10:15 a.m.  Director #6 stated the ED unit secretary would print the EMTALA log for the previous day after midnight.  Director #6 acknowledged there was not a process for them to go back and revisit the disposition if the patient was in the ED after midnight.  Additionally, s/he stated if the patient left the ED for a procedure (GI lab, radiology or the operating room) it would not populate the EMTALA log as the patient would not be discharged    from the ED.

Based on interviews and document review, the facility failed to ensure examination and treatment were not delayed for those patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) to receive care, as required by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). In 6 of 20 medical records reviewed, registration staff presented patients with a financial agreement to sign at the time of registration, prior to receiving a medical screening examination and receiving care. In 1 of 20 medical records reviewed, registration staff investigated discounted health care services for a patient who presented for emergency care, prior to ensuring the patient was registered in the ED and received a medical screening examination. These processes created the potential to not only delay treatment, but to discourage patients entering the ED from staying to receive care. 

This failure created the potential for negative patient outcomes and the worsening of patients' conditions as the registration process, used by some staff, required patients to review and sign a financial agreement. 

FINDINGS:

POLICY

According to the policy, EMTALA-Medical Screening Examination and Stabilizing Treatment, reasonable registration processes, including insurance information, may be followed as long as individuals are not unduly discouraged from remaining for further evaluation.  

The facility may complete its routine registration process, including inquiries about insurance coverage, provided that the inquiry does not delay medical screening or stabilizing treatment. 

The facility will train personnel to respond to individual inquiries about their financial liability. Hospital staff will encourage individuals to defer questions about financial liability until after the medical screening examination has been completed. 

DOCUMENT

The document titled, Financial Agreement, a 5 paragraph document of approximately 560 words, was used by staff as part of the registration process. The document contained a line for the patient or the patient's authorized representative to sign and a line for a witness to sign and write the date and time the agreement was signed by both parties. 

The 1st paragraph of the Financial Agreement stated, in part, patients will pay the account or make financial arrangements satisfactory to the facility ""and/or any other providers for payment unless the patient's bill is paid by applicable insurance, governmental programs or other sources. If an account is sent to an attorney for collection, I agree to pay reasonable attorney's fees and collection expenses in addition to the amount due and owing on the bill for health services rendered to the patient. I understand and agree that a delinquent account will be subject to interest at the legal rate."" 

The agreement stated, in paragraph 2, that insurance would be billed for medical services rendered to the patient, and payment from the insurer would be sought by the facility before the insured would be required to make payments, with the exception of applicable co-payments and deductibles, which, it stated, the patient or the insurance holder must pay. The agreement stated, ""I understand and agree that I am responsible for and will pay for medical services rendered to the patient in the event that our insurance does not authorize these services or does not pay for these services."" The agreement stated the signing party agrees to normal business communication from the facility, regarding payment, through letter, email, telephone, test, voice message, or any other available technologies used by businesses. 

The agreement stated, in part, in paragraph 3, ""It is understood and agreed, however, that the patient and I are primarily responsible for payment of the patient's bill and that we are obligated to pay and agree to pay for any portion of the bill not paid for by insurance and other sources."" 

The agreement stated, in paragraph 5, in the event that the patient and/or the representative have made a payment on an active account, whether through cash, check, credit card or other means, and there remains additional funds available after that account is satisfied (e.g. an overpayment), the facility is authorized to apply the overpayment to any other account owed by the patient that remains unpaid.

According to the job description, Patient Financial Services Representative (PFS), these employees explain and obtain signatures on the facility's legal forms including Financial Agreements. The PFS employees perform all functions according to established policies,  procedures, and regulatory requirements. PFS employees use sound judgement to prioritize work and to ensure appropriateness and timeliness of each patient's care.

1. A PFS representative failed to ensure care was not delayed for Patient #2, who presented to the facility seeking emergency treatment for an injury. Patient #2 was bleeding from a hand laceration when s/he entered the facility. 

a) Review of the medical record for Patient #2 revealed the patient was registered at the Emergency Department (ED) at 4:19 p.m., with the chief complaint being a laceration on the right palm. The record revealed the laceration was approximately 2 centimeters and had a large amount of ""super glue"" on the laceration. The patient stated s/he sustained an injury to his/her hand from a door the previous night. The patient was unsure of the date of his/her most recent tetanus shot. 

b) Review of the document, MS4 Passport, revealed the patient came to ""the front"" of the facility and was screened for, and qualified for, discounted health care services. The MS4 document revealed PFS #1 gave the patient booklets regarding the discounted health care services. 

c) On 12/16/15 at 8:22 a.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated s/he received EMTALA training as a new employee and annually thereafter. PFS #1 stated in meetings with his/her direct supervisor and with other PFS employees, no EMTALA issues or concerns had been discussed since the facility opened. PFS #1 stated patients do enter the main door to the facility, instead of the door to the ED, seeking emergency care. S/he stated recently, a patient entered the main door to the facility with a hand laceration and was bleeding from the wound. PFS #1 stated per his/her training, s/he escorted the patient back to the ED desk for registration and to be seen for his/her injury. 

d) On 12/16/15 at 1:59 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated the patient with the hand laceration was Patient #2. PFS #1 reviewed the MS4 Passport document for this patient and confirmed s/he had seen the patient at the main entrance to the facility on   the day the patient entered, bleeding, and seeking emergency care. PFS #1 stated the patient was concerned about the cost of care for the ED visit. In response to this concern, PFS #1 contacted a lead financial staff person by phone for assistance and together they began the process of obtaining discounted heath care for the patient. PFS #1 stated the patient continued to bleed from his/her hand laceration during this time. PFS #1 stated s/he was with the patient for ""quite a while"" at the front registration desk before walking the patient back to the ED for registration. PFS #1 stated 4:19 p.m. was the time the patient arrived at the ED registration desk and not the time the patient arrived at the main entrance to the facility seeking care. PFS #1 could not state what time the patient entered the main entrance to the facility. 

e) On 12/16/15 at 9:05 a.m., an interview was conducted with the PFS Supervisor, PFS #2. The supervisor stated if a patient entered the facility seeking emergency care but did not wish to be registered until knowing the cost of the ED visit, his/her staff had been trained to respond to these patients by encouraging the patients to stay and be seen by the clinical staff so they could ""feel better first"" before discussing the cost of care. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should not conduct ""insurance work-up"" for any ED patient until the patient had received a medical screening examination. The Supervisor stated this was part of the PFS staffs' training. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should call for a Registered Nurse to come to the registration area in order to see and speak with any patient who presented to the ED but did not wish to register for any reason, including for financial reasons. 

The Supervisor stated the registration process for patients who entered the facility through the main entrance seeking emergency care was the same as for those patients who entered through the ED. The Supervisor stated the PFS staff would escort a patient from the main entrance of the facility to the ED to register at the ED desk. PFS staff could ask the patient's name and phone the ED registration desk to inform staff they were bringing a patient back, or would simply escort the patient back to the ED. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should not delay these patients being registered and seen by clinical staff in order to receive a Medical Screening Examination

2. Registration staff gave patients, who presented to the ED seeking care, a financial agreement to read and sign as part of the registration process, prior to receiving a medical screening examination in 6 of 20 medical record reviewed (Patients #1, #6, #7, #8, #16, and #17). This process was used for patients who presented to the ED with complaints such as chest pain and shortness of breath, abdominal cramping and dizziness, fever and vomiting, and seizure activity. This registration process failed to ensure patients' medical screening examinations and care were not delayed and could have discouraged some patients from staying to receive a medical screening examination and care.  

a) Review of the medical records and the MS4 Passport registration documents was conducted for a sample of 20, ED and Obstetrics (OB) patients. 

i) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #1 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, and feeling ""very"" disoriented, since experiencing sharp chest pain approximately 1.5 hours prior to entering the ED. The history and physical revealed the patient had no prior history of this type of event. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 6:26 a.m., and the Financial Agreement was signed by the patient's spouse at 6:29 a.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 6:31 a.m. 

ii) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #6 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, head ache, and dizziness. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 5:16 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 5:19 p.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 5:35 p.m. 

iii) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #7 revealed the patient, a child, was brought to the ED by his/her parent with complaints of fever and vomiting x 6. Document review revealed the patient and parent entered the ED and the patient was registered at 2:48 p.m. Review of the Financial Agreement revealed the parent signed the agreement at 4:30 p.m., which was the time of the patient's discharge from the ED. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement. 

The MS4 registration documented contained a statement from PFS #1 that the MS4 system was not able to be accessed and s/he printed a hard copy of the Financial Agreement for the parent to sign. PFS #1 documented the parent did not stop by the desk at the time of discharge (4:30 p.m.) and s/he was unable to update the patient's demographics or obtain insurance information from the parent.   

On 12/16/15 at 1:48 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who reviewed the registration documents for Patient #7 and stated the Financial Agreement was signed by the patient's parent at the time of registration (2:48 p.m.) and not at the time of discharge from the ED at 4:30 p.m., as documented. PFS #1 confirmed s/he wrote in the time of 4:30 p.m. as  the time both s/he and the parent signed the Financial Agreement. PFS #1 stated the time of 4:30 p.m. did not represent the time the document was actually signed. 

iv) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #8 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of flank pain and a history of kidney stones. 
Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 3:26 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 3:30 p.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 3:42 p.m. 

v) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #16 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of heroin use, the desire to begin a detox program, and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and non-compliance with medications prescribed for bipolar disorder. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 5:28 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 5:00 p.m., 28 minutes prior to being registered in the ED. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at 5:00 p.m.. The patient received a medical screening examination at 5:38 p.m. At 9:10 p.m., the ED record revealed the patient eloped from the ED by walking out of the examination room. The patient was documented as ""stable"" at the time of elopement. No reason was documented in the medical record or in the MS4 system stating why the patient left the ED. 

vi) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #17 revealed the patient came to the ED by ambulance with complaints of seizure activity. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 10:45 p.m., and gave documented ""verbal"" agreement to the Financial Agreement at 11:00 p.m., which was witness and signed by 2 staff members. PFS #2 was 1 of 2 staff who signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement. 

RN #4 conducted a neurological assessment of the patient at 10:52 p.m., at which time s/he documented the patient was slow to answer questions, was drowsy, and had slurred speech. The RN documented the patient was confused, disoriented, and had tremors. The patient received a medical screening examination at 11:08 p.m. The physician documented at this time the patient presented with alcohol withdrawal, was shaky, and confused.  

b) On 12/16/15 at 9:39 a.m., an interview was conducted with the PFS Supervisor, PFS #2. The Supervisor stated the Financial Agreement for patients who entered the ED seeking care should not be signed at the time of initial registration if patients were experiencing issues such as chest pain or symptoms of stroke, for example. The Supervisor stated for patients not stating issues of this nature, but less serious issues, the registration process did not prohibit PFS staff from obtaining the patient's signature on the Financial Agreement. The Supervisor stated PFS staff did not have clinical background or training to enable them to make judgements at the registration desk regarding patients' presenting symptoms. The Supervisor stated s/he observed PFS staffs' work and processes approximately once each month, for each staff person, and had not noted issues with the registration process being carried out as PFS staff had been trained. 

c) On 12/16/15 at 1:48 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated s/he was trained and instructed by his/her supervisor to obtain signed Financial Agreements from patients at the time of discharge or at the patient's bedside in the ED once patients had received a medical screening examination. PFS #1 stated s/he had patients sign the Financial Agreement document at the same time patients signed the consent to treatment document, at initial registration, because it was an easier process to carry out. PFS #1 confirmed his/her signature as the witness on the Financial Agreements for 5 of the 6 patients reviewed (Patients #1, #6, #7, #8, and #16).  

d) On 12/16/15 at 2:06 p.m., an interview was conducted with the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Employee #3, who stated s/he had been assured by staff the registration process in the ED was one that met all EMTALA requirements. The COO stated s/he had ultimate responsibility for the processes used in the facility and the care provided to patients in the facility.

The COO stated obtaining financial information from patients and discussion of the financial piece of the ED visit should be conducted at the time of discharge from the ED. The COO stated this included obtaining patients' signatures on the Financial Agreement, as having this document signed at the time of initial registration could delay the medical screening examination and patient care. The COO stated PFS staff were not clinical and therefore could not make a judgement of which patients could sign this document at the time of registration and which should not sign due to the nature of their symptoms and chief complaint. The COO stated presenting the Financial Agreement to patients at the time of registration could deter some patients from staying to receive care, due to the nature of the document. 

The COO stated s/he had no knowledge that Patient #2 was screened for discounted health care prior to being registered and seen in the ED. The COO stated Patient #2 should have been escorted to the ED to be registered to receive care and PFS staff should not have spent time investigating discounted health care before the patient was registered and received care.

The COO stated s/he was unaware of the practice by some PFS staff of presenting the Financial Agreement document for patient review and for signatures at the time of initial registration. The COO stated the process for registering patients in the ED was to obtain the patients' name, date of birth, and the name of the primary care physician, if the patient had one.  The COO referred to this process as ""quick registration"" and stated this was the process the PFS staff should be using at all times.

Based on interview, review of patient records, policies and procedures, and the central log, the facility failed to maintain a log which included one (Patient #1)  of 25 patients sampled seeking treatment  in the hospital's Emergency Department.

Findings:  

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) log from 5/7/2017 through 5/11/2017 revealed that Patient #1 was not in the Emergency Log.

Review of the medical record revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 2:00 AM. The patient approached staff in the registration area and requested medical treatment. The form presented to the hospital and signed by the midwife showed Patient #1 was sent by the midwife for a 3rd degree perineal tear following a home birth.  

Documentation by the ED Registered Nurse (RN) on 5/9/2017 at 2:00 AM revealed that an ED-OB (Emergency Department)-(Obstetrics) hand off sheet showed Patient #1 was sent to the ED for sutures following a home birth. Patient #1 was transported to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery (LDR) unit at 2:14 AM without a medical screening in the ED.  

During a telephone interview on 5/22/2017 at 5:46 PM, Staff X (Staff in the ED who had Patient #1) stated there was no policy for a patient presenting to the ED after giving birth at home. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 11:05 AM, Staff P stated that Patient #1 should have been seen in the ED before being sent to LDR Unit. Staff P stated they never had a patient from home present to either the ED or LDR after giving birth at home. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 3:15 PM,  Staff Z stated she called the LDR regarding the patient. Patient #1 was not put in the emergency log or seen by a physician/mid-level provider before going to the LDR unit.

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 1:15 PM, Staff Y stated that any post partum patient should be seen in the ED first. Patients who have any kind of vaginal tear need to have an evaluation in the ED first. All patients presenting to the ED are to have a medical screening exam and, if needed, the on-call physician for the specialty needed is then called. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 10:55 AM, Staff O stated that a post partum patient should be seen in the ED before being sent to the LDR unit. When a patient needs a vaginal repair, the patient would go to the operating room  for the laceration repair. Most post partum patients are admitted     through the ED and then go to the operating room (OR). 

Review of the facility's Policy and Procedure, titled ""Medical Screening and Treatment/Transfer Policy (EMTALA)"" revealed  Emergency Department Log, each hospital must maintain a central log to track the care provided to each individual who comes to the hospital seeking care for an emergency condition. The log entry must be made at the first point of contact and must contain the name of the patient, and the disposition of the patient as patient stabilized.

Based on interview, review of medical record, and policies and procedures, the hospital failed to provide a Medical Screening Examination for one (Patient #1) of 25 sampled patients presenting to the hospital's Emergency Department (ED) to determine if an emergency medical condition existed. This failure presented a substantial probability of adversely affecting the health and safety of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department.

Findings:

Review of the medical record revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 2:00 AM. The patient approached registration area and informed the Emergency Department staff requesting medical treatment. The form signed by the midwife showed Patient #1 was sent by the midwife for a 3rd degree perineal tear following a home birth.  

Documentation by the ED Registered Nurse (RN) on 5/9/2017 at 2:00 AM revealed that an ED-OB( Emergency Department)-(Obstetrics) hand off sheet showed Patient #1 included the birth of the baby at home and the need to have sutures. A form signed by a midwife stated the patient had a 3rd degree perineal tear, time of delivery 2245 on 5/8/17. Patient #1 was transported to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery (LDR) unit at 2:14 AM. There was no documentation in the patient's medical record to indicate Patient #1 was medically screened  in the ED by a physician/mid-level prior to being sent to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit. 

Documentation by the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit nurse on 5/9/2017 at 2:15 AM revealed that the patient arrived to the Unit after a home birth (assisted by a mid-wife). At 2:16 AM a physical  by the LDR RN was performed on Patient #1 that revealed the perineum appears to  have a 3rd degree laceration from perineum extending into the vagina. At 2:20 AM, a call/page was made to the on-call physician for walk-in's. The physician was informed of the need for repair of a possible 3rd degree laceration following a vaginal home birth. The physician refused to come in and repair the laceration. The physician gave orders for the patient to follow up in the office in the morning. The Labor/Delivery/Recovery nurse stated again to the on-call physician that he was requested to come in to the facility to repair the laceration. The on-call physician stated again no. The charge nurse of the LDR Unit was aware of the situation.  A call was placed to the hospital house supervisor regarding what the on-call physician had told the RN in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit. At 5:02 AM, both verbal/written instructions were given to Patient #1 to go to the on-call physician's office in the morning for the laceration repair. Patient #1 stated she would not be seeing this physician. A repeat phone call was made to the on-call physician that Patient #1 was refusing to leave until the laceration was repaired. The physician was told that the ED was not willing to do the repair, as it was not in their area of expertise. The on-call physician stated he had explained to the RN in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit to send patient home and follow up in the morning in his office. The RN again explained that the patient was requesting the laceration be repaired. The physician stated that an episiotomy was not an emergency. Patient #1 was given information and discharged    home. 

A review of the medical record showed: Review of symptoms: Drainage at perineum site small. Perineum revealed a 3rd degree laceration to perineum extending to the vaginal area. BP (Blood Pressure) 142/76, and pulse 110, shows small amount of drainage and no clots. Discharge vitals include BP 125/63 and pulse of 105. Review of post care instructions shows that the peripad was changed and had small amount of drainage. Further discharge instructions included patient to go the on-call physician's office to have laceration repaired and patient refused. 

Patient #1 followed up on 05/09/2017 with another obstetrician who took the patient to surgery and repaired the perineal tear in the Munroe Regional Medical Center operating room and discharged    her home the same day.

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 11:05 AM, Staff P stated that Patient #1 should have been seen in the ED before being sent to LDR Unit. Staff P stated they never had a patient from home present to either the ED or LDR before. 

During a telephone interview on 5/22/2017 at 2:55 PM, Staff S (The RN who was taking care of Patient #1 in the LDR Unit) stated that on 5/9/2017 at 2:15 AM, after Patient #1 was brought to the LDR after having a baby at home by a midwife. She had called the on-call physician and he stated would not come in for the repair. The discharge instructions by the on-call physician was for Patient #1 to come to the office in morning for repair of the laceration. Staff S stated that she had also called the house supervisor and was waiting for her to call back.

During a telephone interview on 5/23/2017 at 11:30 AM, Staff U (Supervisor on-call on 5/9/2017) stated that they had a conversation with Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit charge nurse regarding Patient #1. Patient #1 could stay in the LDR Unit until morning and get the laceration repair. Staff U had spoken to the physician on-call. The physician on-call still stated it was not an emergency and the patient could be discharged    home and seen in his office in the AM for the laceration repair. Staff U stated to the physician on-call that LDR staff were uncomfortable and needed Patient #1 to be seen. The vital signs were within normal parameters and drainage was minimal. Patient # 1 decided to leave. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 1:15 PM, Staff Y stated that any post-partum patient should be seen in the ED first. Patients who have any kind of vaginal tear need to have an evaluation in the ED first. All patients presenting to the ED are to have a medical screening exam and, if needed, the on-call physician for the specialty needed, is then called. 

A review of the on-call physician for week of 5/8/2017 to 5/14/2017 and review of the on-call schedule for Labor/Delivery/Recovery and ED validated that on 5/9/2017 Staff V was the physician on-call for walk-in's. 

Review of the facility's Policy and Procedure, titled  ""Medical Screening and Treatment/Transfer Policy (EMTALA)"" revealed  Emergency Department Log: Each hospital must maintain a central log to track the care provided to each individual who comes to the hospital seeking care for an emergency condition. The log entry must be made at the first point of contact and must contain the name of the patient, and the disposition of the patient as patient stabilized.

_x000d_
Based on observation, reviews of medical records, policies and procedures, daily activity sheet and staff interviews, the facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided that was within the capability of the hospital ' s emergency department.  This includes ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed after the presentation status had changed while still on hospital property  for 1 (patient #1) of 26 medical records reviewed.

Findings:

1. Interview with the complainant on 08/08/2014 at 10:30 AM revealed the patient #1 had gone shopping with her sister and her mother on 07/29/2014 and she complained of headaches and body pain.  The patient ' s family believed that something was not right and convinced the patient to go the emergency room    (ER) for an evaluation.  The family drove the patient to the ER.  The patient was able to walk from the car to the reception desk.  Patient #1 was subsequently admitted     to another acute care facility (#3) and was in the Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator having seizures according to the complainant.

2. Patient #1 ' s medical record from Lake City Medical Center was reviewed.  Review of the form  "" Emergency Patient Record ""  revealed that patient #1 arrived to the Emergency Department and walked to the reception desk and was signed in at 18:30 (6:30 p.m.).  Patient #1 was triaged (degree of urgency to illness to decide the order of treatment) by a triage nurse as semi -urgent. The patient ' s vital signs at 18:55 (6:55 p.m.) taken by the triage nurse was listed as: Blood Pressure: 148/75; Pulse: 100; Respirations: 18; temperature: 98.1 Pain level -8 (pain scale 0-10 -0 no pain and 10 being the worst pain).  At 18:34 (6:34 p.m.) the patient was taken to a room where she concurrently received a medical screening examination by triage Physician ' s  Assistant, (PA).  Review of the patient ' s medical record indicated that family was not present during the medical screening examination (MSE) and was not interviewed by either the PA or the triage nurse.  Review  of the   "" Emergency Provider Report ""  (EPR) , dated 7/29/2014 at 1855 (6:55 p.m.), indicated that patient #1 presented with  "" complaint: right  arm pain after drinking juice last night ... the quality of the patient ' s pain was documented as aching, severely moderate and the pain was exacerbated by range of motion. The review of systems sections indicated in part,  "" Gastrointestinal: diarrhea (one episode yesterday) Musculoskeletal: extremity pain right arm.  The PA documented in part, Physical examination:  "" Extremities: assessment  ... patient (pt.) had mild pain with passive and active pronation and supination of right arm. MDM (Medical Decision Making).  Prob-non-Trauma-ED course: pt...  course-pt...  had FROM (Full Range of Motion) of right Fingers/arm/hand /wrist /shoulders w (with)/neuro- vascular exam (examination). ""  The PA documented that the medical screening examination was normal. The patient was then asked to wait in the ER  (emergency room   ) waiting room until the admission clerk could talk to them. The medical record also revealed that at 18:58 (6:58 P.M.) the patient walked to the waiting room on her own power and with a normal gait.  The medical record revealed a document titled NON-URGENT MSE DETERMINATION that the top section  "" ER  Physician  "" was signed by the ER  physician at 1853 (6:53 p.m.)  7/29/2014 stating that  "" Medical Screening COMPLETE: immediate medical attention not necessary: no acute symptoms of sufficient severity or a woman in active labor found: no immediate serious impairment or dysfunction or organs is reasonably expected. ""   The lower section of the form: ER  REGISTRAR was signed by the registrar at 1914 (7:14 p.m.) by the registrar and revealed  "" Patient elects not to continue medical care with this facility and care givers at this time.  Patient provided with information related to alternate community medical resources.  ""   Further review of the medical record revealed that the patient was walked back to the ER  Registrar desk.  The document revealed that the patient physically left the building at 1914 (7:14 p.m.). 

3. Review of the Daily Activity Sheet completed by the Security Guard dated 7/29/2014 revealed the following entry at 1940 (7:40 p.m.)   "" Called to admitting, person will not leave the admitting office- Lake City Police Department (LCPD) called to remove person from admitting office-Person will not talk-sister may cause problems-Police arrived at 1950 (7:50 p.m.)  -remove person from admitting office "" .


4. Review of the EMS Pre-hospital Care Report Summary dated 07/29/2014 revealed that the patient ' s initial vital signs were BP 189/105, P 130  (normal pulse 60-100) R- 22 and BS 301. Review of the Narrative History Text revealed,  "" MEDIC 1 DISPATCHED TO LCMC  (Lake City Medical Center) FOR A pt.. (Patient #1) IN THE PARKING LOT. UPON ARRIVAL pt.. FOUND IN A WHEELCHAIR.  ER  STAFF WAS WAITING OUTSIDE WITH PAT (Patient #1). STAFF STATED WAS SEEN FOR SHOULDER PAIN AND discharged   . pt.. THEN COMPLAINED OF WEAKNESS AND WAS SITTING IN THE LOBBY REFUSING TO LEAVE LCMC.

5.  Review of the ER  record obtained from Acute care facility #2 dated 07/30/2014 at 0517 (5:17 a.m.) revealed as part of the Physician Documentation  "" Patient arrives via EMS from Lake City Medical Center ED with unresponsiveness.  History per EMS is that the patient was seen in the Lake City Medical Center (LCMC) triage and told she did not have an emergency and was wheeled out to the Ambulance by LCMC staff in a wheelchair and was unresponsive upon their arrival.  The report giving 2 mg of IV Narcan (medication that reverses effects of other narcotic medicines) with no response.  The family reports the following; patient had N/v/d (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) yesterday, with headache, pain in the back of neck and upper back radiating to the right shoulder.  She continued to have N/V today and family states that she was  "" not acting right  "" .  They described her (patient#1) as being somewhat unfocused and confused with global generalized weakness.  Unknown if patient had a fever or not. Onset of the symptoms/episode became/occurred yesterday, and became worse just prior to arrival. Severity of symptoms: At their worst the symptoms were incapacitating in the emergency department, the symptoms are unchanged.  The patient has not experienced similar symptoms in the past.  The patient has been recently seen by a physician at Lake City Medical Center earlier today, with similar presenting complaints, was MSE ' d (medically screened) and determined not be non-emergent.  "" Review of the TRANSFER CERTIFICATION FORM completed by Acute care facility #2 on 07/03/2014 at 0515 (5:15 a.m.) revealed the reason for transfer to Acute care Facility #3 was to treat patient #1 ' s diagnosis of Meningitis.

6. The Discharge Summary from acute care facility #3 was reviewed.  Review of the discharge summary dated 8/18/2014 revealed in part,  "" Secondary Diagnosis: Vasospasm of cerebral artery, Diabetes Mellitus, meningitis due to bacteria, seizure.   ...Hospital Course ... [AGE] year old female  ... transferred from Acute Care Facility #2 ...for management of meningitis. The patient underwent LP and CT at Hospital B ...Upon transfer the patient was admitted     to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and intubated for failure to protect airway.  There she was noted to have left sided weakness; demonstrated abnormal perfusion in the right MCA (Mid Cerebral Artery) and PCA (Posterior Cerebral Artery)which was diagnosed    as vasospasm secondary to meningitis .... She experienced one seizure that lasted 90 seconds ...she was subsequently started on fosphention (medication used to treat seizures) (per neurology for 3-6 months) ...Discharge instructions: PT. (physical Therapy) OT (Occupational Therapy): Physical/Occupational inpatient rehabilitation 
Nursing Home/Rehab: Physical/Occupational rehab. ""



7. The facility ' s policy titled  "" EMTALA- Florida medical Screening Examination and Stabilization Policy ""  Policy #900.036 effective date 2/20/97 was reviewed. The policy specified in part,  "" Definitions: Services Capability: means all services offered by the hospital where identification of services offered is evidenced by the appearance of the service in a medical record ...  Relieve or Eliminate the Emergency Medical Condition means the provision of care treatment  ...consistent with the applicable standard of care, by a physician necessary to either eliminate the emergency medical condition or to eliminate the likelihood that the emergency medical condition will deteriorate or recur without further medical attention within a reasonable period of time ...  Procedure:  WHEN A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION IS RQUIRED: An individual MUST receive a MSE within the capabilities of the hospital ' s DED (dedicated Emergency Department) to determine whether or not an EMC exists ....1. the individual comes to the dedicated emergency department  of a hospital and a request is made on his or her behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition,  Extent of the MSE (Medical Screening Examination): 2. No difference by location: The MSE performed on hospital property other than a DED must be the same medical screening that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospitals DED with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individual ' s ability to pay for medical care ...5 Varies by presenting symptoms. The facility is required only to perform such medical screening within the scope of its capabilities as would be appropriate for any individual presenting at the DED in that matter to determine that the individual does have an EMC. A. Depending on the individual ' s presenting symptoms, the MSE may range from  a simple process invoilving  only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that also involves performing ancillary studies and procedures such as (but not limited to) lumbar punctures, clinical laboratory tests, CT scans and other diagnostic tests and procedures.



8.  An interview with the triage PA on 08/08/2014 at 12:30 PM revealed that I work both as the triage  PA and the ER  PA  to help out in the back until the second PA comes in at 12 noon if I am not busy. I determine if the person is to be seen in the emergency room    by the physician.  Every non-emergency patient is discussed with the physician except for suture removals. The patients do not discuss in triage if they are going to be seen in the ER  or not.  I make the determination then they go to registration, registration gives them the determination that was made and their options.  If the person insists on being seen the charge nurse in the ER  gets involved.  Continued interview with the PA, around 6:30 PM revealed the triage nurse went to get the patient. The patient did not answer when called.  The second triage staff arrived and called for the patient and the patient came back.  She did complain of some diarrhea the day before, she was afebrile; she had no neck pain whatsoever.  There was nothing abnormal about the patient; her only complaint was that her right arm hurt after drinking juice.  She walked into the triage area walking normally.  About 15 minutes later the registrar came and told me that this patient had vomited in the registration area I told her to talk to the charge nurse.  The charge nurse came to me 10 minutes later and asked me if I would take another look at her which I did.  Her ESP ' s (Emergency Screening Protocol) remained non- emergent.  She was in registration when she seen again in the presence of the charge nurse.  Still her only complaint was that her arm hurt.  We did not repeat the vital signs in triage or in the admissions area.  She did not have a fever.  I do not know who called the police.  The PA stated this is where I re-evaluated her.  During this interview the PA was observed on the side of the desk where the registrar was seated and the desk separated the PA from the patient.  He stated that the patient raised her arm and said that it still hurts.  The PA stated that he left to go back to the ER  and never saw the patient again.  Other than the NON-URGENT MSE DETERMINATION form the medical record did not document any information relating to the care the patient received or any events that occurred during the encounter at the registrar ' s desk or after the patient left the registrar desk.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was completed.  This includes ancillary services routinely available to emergency department to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed after patient #1 ' s presentation signs and symptoms had changed (change in mentation, weakness and Vital signs) while still on hospital property.  The hospital staff was well aware the change in patient #1 ' s medical condition status on 7/29/2014.


9. Interview with the day shift charge nurse on 08./8/2014 at 12:42 PM registration has a scripted guide for persons to be seen in the ER.  If the person still wants to be seen, the charge nurse reiterates what registration has told them.  If the patient cannot pay but wishes to be seen, the triage nurse would take them back to the triage area to be re-evaluated and speak to the ER  doctor.  The house supervisor should be notified if person insist on being seen or refuses to leave.
There was no documentation in the medical record to indicate that House supervisor was notified when it was determined that patient #1 needed to be re-evaluated. 

10.  Interview on 08/08/2014 at 1:08 PM with emergency room    physician on duty on 07/29/2014 revealed that with the emergency screening protocol (ESP) if PA does not think it is an emergency then the co-pay has to be paid. The patient makes the decision to be seen after speaking with the registrar if they have no insurance it is a $150.00 flat rate co-payment this includes any lab or x-rays.  Anytime the mid-level sees someone if they have a question as to whether or not the person needs to be seen in the ER  they will consult with the ER  doctor before making the determination.  The ER  physician reviews all of the mid-level staff charts.  Review of the medical revealed that .the ER  physician was consulted by the PA but did not examine or see the patient.  The hospital failed to ensure that their policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a MSE was provided for patient #1on 7/29/2014 regardless of the patient ' s ability to pay after her medical condition had changed while still on hospital property.


11. Interview with the security guard on 09/08/2014 at 3:45 p.m. stated that; I was making rounds in the facility and one of the girls called me to the registration area because they had a patient that had vomited.  I went to my office which is located off the registration area, I wear hearing aids so I having a hard time understanding her verbiage, but I was able to hear a lady that was with the patient (patient#1) say that they have examined her.  The lady was talking a little loud.  I did not hear the patient (patient#1) say anything.  I left the area to complete my rounds.  I was not contacted to come back to the triage area.  When I completed my rounds and came back into the ER  area the police were present talking to the patient.  I do not know who called the police.  The police encouraged the patient to get out of the wheelchair in the triage area and to get into the wheelchair so she could leave the facility. The last time I saw patient#1 she was sitting in the wheelchair outside with Paramedic (#1) and the other nurse.


12.  Interview with ER  paramedic #1 on 08/08/2014 at 3:49 PM revealed that this patient had already been through triage.  I was asked to come out to the registration area by the registration clerk to help get a patient out of a chair and into a wheelchair.  Paramedic #2 was requested and he came to assist me move the patient from the chair in the registration into a wheelchair.  She could not get out of the chair.  I went and got the PA to come to reevaluate the patient again because she was unable to get out of the chair into the wheelchair and she had thrown up while I was present.  The PA and charge nurse came to the registration area and saw the patient.  They stated that she was okay to leave.  I think the charge nurse called the police.  The police came and encouraged the patient to get out of the chair and into the wheelchair.  We did not have to manually lift her into the wheelchair.  She was able to get into the wheelchair with assistance.  The patient was sitting with her arm on the arm of the wheelchair and she had her head resting on her arm.  Paramedic #2 took her outside in the presence of the police.  I cleaned up the vomit and met Paramedic #2 outside.  Her family was getting a little confrontational verbally with me and Paramedic #2.  The patient was not saying or doing anything.  She did not say that she wanted to go anywhere else.  Myself and paramedic #2 had difficulty getting the patient from the wheelchair into the car we tried for over a half hour but were unable to get her from the wheelchair into the car.  The patient appeared to be very weak.  We called and informed the charge nurse of what was going on with the patient and that the family had asked the police to call Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to transfer the patient to another facility.  She did not give us any new direction, she just replied okay.  Paramedic #2 and I stayed outside with the patient until EMS arrived.  EMS had trouble getting the patient out of the wheelchair onto the stretcher.  She was lifted into a standing position and the stretcher was placed beneath the patient and she was slid onto the stretcher.  The patient left the facility via EMS and paramedic #2 and I came back into the facility.  again ,The ER  paramedic was asked if he received any guidance when he spoke to the charge nurse, again he stated that no guidance was given other than OK.

_x000d_

Based on interview, record review and a review of facility documentation, the facility failed to ensure the performance of appropriate transfers through the completion of documentation in the medical record to indicate the reasons for the requests for transfer, as well as indications as to whether or not the patient is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer and the inclusion of physician-signed a certifications that, based upon the information available at the time of transfers, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweighed the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman in labor (#1), to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred in five of twenty sampled patients (#1, #7, #8, #13 & #18).

Findings:  


A review of policy ""Interfacility Transfer from a Health First Hospital to an Outside Facility"" revealed the following, ""Documentation forms:  Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to transfer.  ... Provide the patient and/or legal representation with information regarding the reason for transfer and the risks associated with the transfer.""  The second page of this document, as referenced in the policy, addresses reasons for the transfer, patient awareness of the risk and benefits of a transfer and a physician certification that the benefits of a transfer to another facility outweighs the risks.

UPSON REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,Short Term,110002,801 W GORDON STREET,THOMASTON,GA,2406,MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM,7/19/17,JOU711,"**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  _x000d_
_x000d_
Based on a review of  medical records, review of an obstetric outpatient record, review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations and Policy and Procedure review and staff interviews the facility failed to ensure that all individuals who presented to their emergency department were provided with an appropriate medical screening examination that was within the capability of the hospital's emergency department including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to determine whether or not  an emergency medical condition exists for one (1- #20) of twenty (20) patients medical records  reviewed.

Findings include:


1. Review of facility policy 2603, EMTALA.01.EMTALA, effective 2/26/2008, revised 5/2/2016, revealed that every individual who presented to the Emergency Department and requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, and every individual who is not a hospital patient who went elsewhere on hospital property (that is, the individual who went to the hospital but not to the dedicated Emergency Department), who either requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, or if a prudent layperson observer would believe that the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition (EMC), must at a minimum have an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to determine if an EMC does or does not exist, regardless of the individual's ability to pay.

2. Review of facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, approved 1/12/2015, revised: 12/16/2015, revealed:
6. All patients who present to the Emergency Department must be seen by a credentialed qualified medical provider. The patient may request his family physician or physician of choice but a medical screening examination to rule out an emergency medical condition and any necessary stabilizing treatment shall not be delayed while waiting for a requested physician to arrive. At no time will patients be discharged    from the Emergency Department without a provider evaluation.

3. Patient #20's medical record dated 6/30/2017 was reviewed. Documentation by the ED nurse revealed that Patient #20 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 5:12 PM, ambulatory and alone. The medical record also revealed the patient's insurance was listed as ""Self-Pay."" The patient's initial vital signs were: Temperature: 98.1 (oral); Heart rate 96; Blood Pressure: 142/75; and Oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Further review of the medical record revealed blood laboratory work and urine was collected for a pregnancy test, Urine microscopic and urine analysis were ordered. A CT of the abdomen without contrast was also ordered. The Emergency Department Note Draft, dated 6/30/2017 revealed in part, ""HPI (history of Present illness. Review of Systems)...Chief Complaint: Vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks. History of Present illness: The patient (#20) ...with bleeding every day for the past 3 weeks. She is on no hormonal medications.....she has a ParaGard IUD (intra uterine device). There has been bleeding every day that is similar in severity to her normal menses an is associated with some clots being passed. She is going through 6-7 pads  per day... She talked to a nurse at the gynecologist office today who directed her here."" Further review revealed the patients ""Discharge Disposition: Home  Condition: Fair. Departure: Clinical Impression: Vaginal Bleeding.""  There was no documentation in the medical record to indicate that Patient #20 received a vaginal examination on 6/30/2017. The facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was performed for Patient #20 on 6/30/2017.


4. Interview with the ER  Director on 7/18/2017 at 2:38 PM in the conference room confirmed that Patient #20 had not received an MSE (medical screening examination) 7/3/2017. The ER  Director explained that Patient #20 presented to the ER  registration desk mid-morning on 7/3/2017. The ER  Director stated further that the only person at the registration desk was the ER  technician, and that the ER  was not very busy during that time. The ER  Director stated that he/she became aware of the situation on 7/3/2017 at about 11:00 AM when he/she received a phone call from the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) asking if he/she was aware of Patient #20's situation. The CNO stated that he/she had received a phone call from the hospital's accrediting agency. The accrediting agency informed the CNO  that they had received a phone call from Patient #20, who stated that the ER  would not see her, and the CNO asked the ER  Director to look into it. The ER  Director stated that he/she phoned Patient #20, who explained that she was still bleeding, that she had tried to follow up with her OB-gyn MD that day, but that the office was closed due to the holiday.  Patient #20 also stated that she had spoken to the OB-gyn office's nurse, who had instructed her to return to the ER. Patient #20 further explained that when she arrived at the ER  to get her IUD out, the registrar/technician told her that the hospital's ER  doesn't remove IUDs, but they would be happy to see her.  After being given that information, Patient #20 stated that she left. The ER  Director stated that he/she told Patient #20 that he/she would contact the OB-gyn MD or nurse to learn where the hospital was in the process of getting her care, and call her back.  The ER  Director stated that he/she then left a voice mail for the OB-gyn MD, and had a mid-level provider send a text the MD with a message to contact him/her. The ER  Director further stated that after approximately twenty to thirty (20-30) minutes, he/she heard a lullaby over the intercom, which indicated that a baby had been born, and so went to the labor and delivery department to see if the on-call OB-gyn MD was there.  The ER  Director found OB-gyn MD #9 the labor and delivery department and explained the situation to concerning Patient  #20 to MD #9. The ER  Director further explained that the Women's Services manager was also present and that the three of them discussed the best course of action to get care for Patient #20.  The ER  Director, MD #9 and the Women's Services manager decided that the ER  Director would contact Patient #20, and have her return to the women's services area of the hospital, where MD #9 would remove the IUD as an outpatient procedure. The ER  Director further stated that he/she returned to his/her office and phoned Patient #20 a couple of times, was unable to leave a voice message,  therefore also sent Patient #20 a text. The facility failed to ensure that Patient #20 received and appropriate medical screening examination by a Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP) on 7/3/2017; instead the  Patient #20 was discouraged by emergency department staff from being evaluated by a QMP indicating the hospital was not capable of removing the IUD.

5. Patient #20 responded to the ER  Director's text with a message that she had just spoken to MD #9, and was returning to the hospital. The ER  Director stated that he/she then instructed Patient #20 to go to the ER  waiting room and that The ER  Director would escort Patient #20 upstairs. The ER  Director stated that he/she then went to the ER  registration desk, requesting that Patient # 20 be pre-registered so as to avoid a long wait. The ER  Director further explained that Patient # 20 arrived approximately thirty to sixty (30-60) minutes later. The ER  director met Patient #20 in the ER  to complete the registration process, then escorted Patient #20 to the labor and delivery (L&D) department, where the L&D nurse took over care of Patient #20.  The ER  Director stated that as he/she walked with Patient #20, the patient stated that she just wanted the IUD out, so the bleeding would stop, and she could return to work. Patient #20 also stated that she wondered if she was not seen because she did not have insurance, to which the ER  Director had assured her that the registrars at the front desk did not know patients' insurance status and that many patients seen did not have insurance, so it did not matter.

6. Interview with the ER  Charge Nurse on 7/18/2017 at 4:01 PM in the conference room revealed that he/she had worked as Charge Nurse for approximately ten (10) years, and received EMTALA training annually.  The Charge Nurse confirmed that he/she had been in the charge position on 7/3/2017 during the day shift when Patient #20 presented to the ER  for treatment. He/she stated that he/she was in the back working when the ER  technician telephoned him/her stating that Patient #20 was present and was requesting that her IUD be removed. The Charge Nurse stated that Patient #20 had been seen the preceding day or two, treated, and advised to see her OB-gyn physician for the IUD removal. The Charge Nurse stated that he/she asked the technician if Patient #20 had seen her OB-gyn physician or not, and the technician responded ""no"". The Charge Nurse explained that he/she had instructed the technician to tell Patient #20 it was unlikely that the IUD would be removed in the ER, but that they would be happy to see her if she wished to sign in. The Charge Nurse further stated that the technician had told him/her that Patient #20 had left after the conversation, and had not signed in at that point. The Charge Nurse stated that he/she was just trying to be honest with Patient #20 because Patient #20 wouldn't want to sit back there for four or five (4 or 5) hours, then find out that the ER  would not be able to give her the treatment she wanted.

7. Interview with the ER  technician on 7/18/2017 at 4:26 PM in the conference room revealed that he/she had worked in his/her current position on day shift for approximately twelve (12) years, and had been trained in EMTALA. The ER  technician stated that Patient #20 arrived in the ER  stating that an OB-gyn physician had instructed her to meet him at his office, but when she arrived, the office was closed. Patient #20 was upset and enquired whether that physician was on-call or not. The ER  technician stated that he/she had informed Patient #20 that the physician was not on-call, but another physician one was covering. The ER  technician explained that he/she had asked Patient #20 what was going on, and Patient #20 stated that she thought her IUD was out of place, and she wanted to have it removed. The ER  technician stated that he/she informed Patient #20 that the ER  didn't normally remove IUDs there, but she was more than welcome to sign in and see the ER  MD. The technician could not recall if he/she had consulted with the Charge Nurse, or not. The technician stated that Patient #20 then asked if she could have a copy of her X-ray procedure, and the technician had instructed that she could go down the hall to the radiology department to request a copy from them. The technician stated that he/she again asked Patient #20 if she wanted to see the ER  MD, and Patient #20 said ""no"", that she would find someone else with whom to follow up. Patient #20 then walked in the direction of the radiology department, and the next time the technician saw Patient #20, she was with the ER  Director. The technician confirmed that Patient #20 had never signed in.



8. Review of MD #9's documentation on Patient #20 from an obstetric outpatient record dated 7/3/2017 at 4:32 PM, revealed that Patient #20 had experienced vaginal bleeding for three (3) weeks, and was changing pads every two (2) hours.

Patient #20 had not been seen by the on-call OB-gyn physician on Friday (6/30/17). Patient #20 stated that she had called the office again on 7/3/2017 in the morning, and was instructed to go to the ER. Patient #20 explained that on arrival at the ER, staff told her nothing could be done for her at that time.

Based on review of the ED log, Family and Birth Center log, policies and procedures, tour and staff interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to create a medical record for one (1) of 23 sampled medical records when Patient #1 presented to the Obstetric (OB - related to childbirth) assessment area requesting services for an evaluation of a  possible emergency medical condition.

Findings were:

Cross refer to A-2405, as it relates to failure to enter Patient #1 into the OB log.

On 5/13/19 at 10:15 a.m. during a tour of the ED, the Assistant Vice President (AVP) GG confirmed that entering a patient into the ED central log automatically generates a medical record. 

On 5/13/19 at 10:40 a.m. during a tour of the Family Birth Center, the Director DD of the Family Birth Center explained that entering a patient into the Family and Birth Center log automatically generates a medical record.  Director DD stated Patient #1 was not entered into the Family and Birth Center log and therefore, there was no medical record generated for the patient.  

The facility's failure to enter Patient #1 into the facility's Central Log resulted in the facility's failure to create a medial record for Patient #1 when she presented to the emergency department. The facility's policy does not adequately address CFR489.20(r).

Based on review of the central log, policy and procedure, and staff and physician interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that each individual who presented on   a central log for a pregnant patient for 1 of 21 sampled patients (#21).  

Findings were: 

Review of facility policy entitled ""Emergency Medical Screening, Stabilization, Treatment and Transfer"" revealed that a list of all patients that presented to the ED would be maintained.  At a minimum, the log would contain the patient name, chief complaint, and disposition of case.  The log was to be maintained for five (5) years.

Review of the central log for 09/09/11 revealed no evidence of the pregnant patient (#21)having been registered on the log the day that she presented to the ED.

An interview (#7) was conducted at 10:00 a.m. on 09/28/11 with an obstetrical (OB) nurse in the administrative conference room.  The nurse reported being familiar with the pregnant patient from previous visits and stated that the patient called the OB unit late on the night of 09/08/11.  The patient reported having nausea and diarrhea.  The nurse gave the patient some advice on how to relieve the symptoms and recommended that she may need to be seen if symptoms were not relieved.  The patient was advised to call back in an hour to report on her status. The nurse did indicate to the patient that all beds in the Labor and Delivery Unit were currently full.  The patient called back in an hour and the OB nurse transferred the call to the OB physician who was on the unit at the time and was between cesarean-section deliveries.  The interviewee did not hear the conversation between the patient and the doctor.  However, the nurse was told later that the doctor had advised the patient to go to the nearest facility.  The interviewee reported that later during his/her shift the ED registrar called the OB ward clerk to report that the patient had presented to the ED.  The ward clerk conferred with the interviewee who recommended that the patient should follow the previous recommendations given by the OB doctor during their earlier phone conversation.  The interviewee had no further involvement with the patient but heard later that the patient had left to go to another facility.  The OB nurse reported that it was the practice that OB patients who presented to the ED were sometimes examined by the OB staff in the ED or brought to the OB unit for examination if space was available.  


An interview (#4) was conducted at 3:00 p.m. on 09/27/11 with a registrar in the administrative conference room.  The registrar reported that he/she was at the front desk in the ED when the patient arrived and stated that she was having contractions and needed to be seen.  The interviewee spoke with a staff member in the OB unit, as per routine, and informed the staff member that the patient was requesting to be seen.  The registrar was informed that the OB unit was full and that the patient should be instructed to go to a nearby facility.  The interviewee reported that he/she consulted with another registrar as he/she was unclear how to proceed.  The patient was not entered in the central log nor was the ED staff informed of the patient's arrival during the time the registrar was in contact with the OB staff. The other registrar contacted the nursing house supervisor who came and spoke to the patient and family.  The interviewee reported that he/she only heard parts of the conversation between the patient and the nursing supervisor.  At one point, the interviewee heard the patient ask the nursing supervisor what the facility would do if the patient was actually having the baby and the supervisor replied that the patient would then be seen in the ED.  The interviewee reported that the patient and family left the facility after speaking with the house supervisor. 


An interview (#1) was conducted at 1:00 p.m. on 09/27/11 with the Nursing House Supervisor in the Administrative Conference Room.  The supervisor reported that he/she was familiar with the event and confirmed that he/she was working at the time the patient presented to the hospital.  The interviewee reported that he/she was contacted by the OB nurse when the patient presented to the ED.  The interviewee went to speak to the patient who requested to see the Obstetrician (Interviewee #3).  The patient was informed that the Obstetrician was not available.  The interviewee reported that the patient did not want to be examined in the ED but only wanted to see the Obstetrician. The interviewee stated that the family then made a decision to go to Statesboro and left the facility.  The supervisor reported that once the patient had made the decision to not be examined in the ED, he/she felt that it was all right for the patient to go to another facility.  According to the interviewee, the OB physician was not informed that the patient had presented to the ED.  When questioned about the patient's refusal to be seen in the ED, the house supervisor confirmed that refusal for treatment had not been documented. The supervisor also confirmed that patient (#21)  had not been entered in the central log nor had a medical record been established.

An interview was conducted  with the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) and Quality/Risk Manager at 4:00 p.m. on 09/26/11 in the Administrative Conference Room.  The interviewees were aware that the pregnant patient (MDS) dated [DATE].  They confirmed that the patient (#21) was not entered in the central log. In addition, the interviewees reported that they were aware the the patient presented to another facility after leaving this facility.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy was  followed as evidenced by failing to maintain a Central Log on Patient #21 on 9/9/2011, a pregnant female in distress requested medical assistance.

4.  Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations

1.	A review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules, and Regulations, revealed that in addition to a physician, Qualified Medical Persons may perform a Medical Screening Examination. Individuals in the following professional categories who have demonstrated current competency in the performance of Medical Screening Examinations and who are functioning within the scope of his or her license and policies of the Hospital, have been approved by the Board of Trustees as Qualified Medical Personnel:  Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, Licensed Clinical Social Workers, and Psychologists, Nurse Midwives, and Labor & Delivery Registered Nurses for obstetrical patients.  The facility failed to ensure that their Medical Staff Bylaws,  Rules and Regulations were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a medical screening examination was provided for patient #21 on 11/3/2018 when a Nurse Practitioner and ED physician were on duty when the patient  presented to the ED.


5.  Advanced Practice Practitioner Schedule

1.	The hospital's Advanced Practice Practitioner's (APP) schedule for the month of November 2018 was reviewed. The APP's schedule revealed that an Advanced Practice Practitioner was in the ED and available to provide a MSE for Patient #21 on 11/3/2018. 


6.  Policies and Procedures

A review of facility policies and procedures included but was not limited to the following:

1.  EMTALA- Medical Screening Examination and Stabilization policy, revised 03/2017, revealed that the policy's purpose is to establish guidelines for providing appropriate Medical Screening Examinations (MSE) and any necessary stabilization or an appropriate transfer for the individual.  The policy further revealed that an EMTALA obligation is triggered when an individual comes to a Dedicated Emergency Department (DED) and
-- The individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC).  
-- A prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.  The MSE must be completed by an individual qualified to perform such an examination to determine whether an EMC exists or with respect to a pregnant woman having contractions, whether the woman is in labor and whether the treatment requested is explicitly for an EMC.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedure were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a medical screening examination was provided  when a prudent layperson observed and concluded from Patient #21's appearance or behavior needed an  examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition of alleged sexual abuse.

If an EMC is determined to exist, the individual will be provided necessary stabilization treatment, within the capacity and capability of the facility, or an appropriate transfer as defined by and required by EMTALA.  Stabilization treatment shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (e.g. no different level of care because of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law.  The policy also revealed an MSE is performed by, only a qualified physician with appropriate privileges, other qualified licensed practitioner (LIP) with appropriate competencies and privileges or a qualified staff member who is qualified to conduct such an examination through appropriate privileging and demonstrated competencies.  An MSE, stabilizing treatment or appropriate transfer will not be delayed to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status or conditioned on an individual's completion of a financial form, an advance beneficiary notification form, or payment of a co-payment for any services rendered.  


2.  Abuse- (Suspected): Child, Sexual, Elder, and Domestic policy, revised 06/14/2018, revealed that the policy's purpose is to provide criteria which may be used by staff to determine if a suspicion is warranted, and to provide a mechanism for the initiation of medical and psychosocial intervention, as well as reporting to the appropriate agencies.  Continued policy review revealed a child is defined as any female who has not reached Tanner Stage 3 (has not begun menses) or is [AGE] or younger and any male [AGE] years or younger.  Abuse is defined as the willing infliction of injury (burning or hitting), unreasonable confinement such as tying to a chair, or cruel punishment such as withholding of food or medication.  Abuse may be physical, involve threats, insults or harassment and sexual abuse (including rape or sexual molestation/assault), is defined as unwanted sexual activity with perpetrators using force, making threats or taking advantage of victims not able to give consent to include children, adolescents, and adults.  Sexual abuse includes statements from the patient relating to sexual abuse, report from a physician indicating sexual activity at an early age, precocious knowledge of sexuality or sexual terms, presence of sexually transmitted disease in individual thought to be sexually inactive (due to age or physical incapacity), bruising, tears or lacerations to the genitalia and constant hand manipulation of genitals (children).  Sexual assault/rape includes trauma to external genitalia or rectum, torn clothing, bruises or lacerations to the head, evidence of sexual intercourse or presence of urine/feces, recent bathing or obsessive desire to wash/bathe, feeling of being dirty and verbal statement of assault.  The policy review further revealed that reports and suspicions must be pursed and presumed true.  Any staff member who suspects that a patient is a victim of abuse should report their suspicions to Social Services and/or the Nursing Supervisor/Immediate Supervisor.  Mandatory reporting required by law will be done by Social Services, Case Management, Emergency Department or Behavioral Health Services.  The procedure for reporting suspected abuse of children, required information includes the name and address of the person making the report (may use the hospital address), name/address of the child, parents and caretakers, nature and extent of any injuries or condition from suspected abuse or exploitation, any additional information useful in assessing the type of injuries and identifying the individuals and/or activities responsible, child molestation/sexual assault must be reported to a specific facility, law enforcement in the county the assault took place in must be notified, the crisis center (per facility policy) should be notified of all child patients of sexual assault or molestation to determine if a forensic exam is necessary and to schedule the exam to be done by the crisis center.  If the patient presents Monday-Friday from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., the crisis center is called to arrange for the child to present there for the exam. If the child presents after these hours, contact the on-call crisis center representative for direction.  The exam may need to be completed by the emergency department physician, depending on the time frame from assault to availability of the crisis center representative.  The crisis center representatives are available for consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  If the crisis center exam is scheduled for follow-up, the patient is discharged    with instructions to follow up as scheduled for the forensic exam and the patient still receives a medical screening examination and medical care as appropriate prior to discharge. The facility also failed to ensure that this policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to  notify the ED Physician and Nurse Practice Practitioner that patient #21's mother had requested a medical screening examination and or treatment as appropriate prior to be told the facility could not provide an examination to an alleged  pediatric rape victim.

3.  Assessment and Reassessment of the Patient, policy # 14, revision date 11/5/18, provides a guideline to determine the care and treatment needs necessary to meet the patient's initial needs as well as their needs as they change in response to implementation of care and treatment plans.  The process is designed to provide each patient with the best care and treatment possible, taking into consideration the patient's physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physiological status as appropriate.  The policy further indicates that assessment and reassessment data are utilized to develop the interdisciplinary plan of care and to revise this plan throughout the course of care. The policy revealed that all patients presenting to the emergency room    are triaged (assessed) to determine the chief complaint and assign an acuity.  
--Triage is performed by a qualified Registered Nurse (RN) at the time of presentation and may be done in concert with a quick registration.  Triage is an information-collecting and decision-making process performed in order to sort injured and ill patients into categories of acuity and prioritization based on the urgency of their medical or psychological.  A triage acuity level must be recorded for all patients on all shifts, including ambulance patients.  
--The Triage Acuity Levels are as follows:
-Level 1 Resuscitation
-Level 2 Emergent
-Level 3 Urgent
-Level 4 Semi-Urgent
-Level 5 Non-Urgent
--Initial (Rapid) Nursing Assessment- Is part of the Triage Process and should be performed on all patients within 10 minutes of arrival to the ED.  A rapid assessment should be used when 2 or more patients are waiting to be triaged.
--Focused Nursing Assessment- A process of evaluation pertinent to the patient's chief complaint, condition, and symptoms.  Patients waiting for the initiation of the medical screening exam (MSE) shall have at a minimum a focused reassessment performed at least hourly or more frequently if condition and acuity warrant.

4.  Non-Discrimination Statement, policy # 28, revealed that the facility complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state, or local law.

7.  Credentialing Files

A review of two (2) credential files (#3 and 5) revealed the (2) files contained current state licensure and delineation of privileges.  The files included evidence of EMTALA training within the past year.

8.  Personal Files

A review of three (3) personnel files (#1, 2 and 4) revealed the three (3) files contained current state licensure and facility required orientation and competency testing.  The files (#1 and 2) contained evidence of EMTALA training within the past year.  File # 4 did not contain EMTALA training.

Based on review of patient medical records, policy/procedures, documentation, and staff interviews, the hospital failed to follow the policies and procedures to ensure stabilizing treatment occurred within the hospital's capability for 3 of 45 sampled patient medical records (Patients 22, 29 a and 29 b. The hospital had a monthly average of 4,858 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) requesting care.

Failure to provide appropriate stabilizing treatment resulted in the patients' transfer to other hospitals or discharge and delayed their treatment for an emergency medical condition.  

Findings include:

1. Review of the hospital's psychiatric capabilities per a document titled ""2 East Scope of Service"", last revised 8/15 revealed in part, "". . . 2 East is a 30-bed closed psychiatric unit located on the second floor.  Security of the unit is ensured by double locked doors at the main entrance, locked exit doors and camera monitoring of the front entrance and key areas in the unit.  The rooms in the North hall are accessed through an additional locked door and is where the most acute psychiatric patients are admitted    .  All rooms on the North hall are camera monitored. Patients hospitalized    on 2 East are those in acute emotional crisis, psychosis, confused status or under emergency detention/court order.
 

2. Review of a Standard Operating Procedure titled ""Law Enforcement Patients"" and approved by the Hospital President with an effective date of 2/2014 reads in part, Law enforcement patients can be admitted     while under three types of circumstances: a.  ""Patient released with promise to appear"", b. ""Patients hospitalized    under Detainee/Hold"" and c. ""Patients hospitalized    following apprehension due to serious crime or for a patient requiring protection.""

3. Review of a closed medical record revealed Patient # 22 presented to the emergency department (ED) accompanied by police on 11/21/16 at 11:58 AM complaining of muscle weakness, abdominal pain and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  

Staff C, ED Advanced Registered Nurse (ARNP) on 11/21/16 at 1:43 PM, documented in the medical record that patient # 22 was very lethargic during the initial assessment.  Further documentation showed the patient denied any recent drug use and acknowledged that he had not been taking his normal psychiatric medications as prescribed. 

Staff AA, Linn County Mental Health worker, notified the St. Luke's social worker about the pending committal of Patient #22 due to deterioration in his mental condition, non-compliance with his prescribed medications and multiple calls to the Police in the last couple of weeks. 

Review of the Court document signed by the local Judge November 21, 2016 at 3:59 PM (four hours after patient # 22's arrival to the ED), read in part,  ... [Patient # 22] is seriously mentally impaired and is likely to injure himself or others if allowed to remain at liberty.   ... [Patient # 22] shall be detained at St. Luke's Hospital  ... and that said matter will be heard  ... before said Court at St. Luke's Hospital on the 28th day of November, 2016 at 8:00 A.M.  Further the Court document indicated the ""On-Call Physician, St. Luke's Hospital"" was appointed to conduct a personal examination of patient # 22 to determine whether he was seriously mentally impaired.  

The affidavit in support of the Court document read in part  ... patient # 22 was homeless and over the past 10 days had been arrested 3 times.  His mental state was deteriorating.  Further documentation showed patient # 22 had been talking about silver flakes, Martians having taken over the world, and that he was scared to eat food because he felt it was poisoned.   

Review of St. Luke's psychiatric unit census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 27 inpatients (3 available beds) on the 2 East psychiatric unit on 11/21/16 and no open beds on the additionally secured North hall.

On day two of patient # 22's stay in the ED (11/22/16) at 12:03 PM, on-call Psychiatrist D evaluated patient # 22 and documented in part  ... the patient was ""currently homeless, living on the streets, has been refused by every shelter due to violence and does not appear to have family that can safely take him in.""   ...   Further documentation showed that in Psychiatrist D's opinion, patient # 22 was seriously mentally impaired, unable to make responsible decisions regarding his treatment and that the patient was so violent that ""our department does not have capacity to treat him on our unit"" due to significant  history of assaulting others.  Psychiatrist D recommended patient # 22 be placed on an anti-psychotic medication, both oral and injectable  ... ""Placing him on an anti-psychotic is not going to fix the problem of chronic dangerousness, and subjecting my nursing staff to repeated abuse will only land [patient # 22] in jail."" 

At 12:09 PM on 11/22/16, the ED physician documented, ""No issues during the day.""  ""Psych saw the patient in the emergency room   .""  ""We are trying to get him [patient # 22] committed to [Hospital B].""

At 12:23 PM, the ED mid-level practitioner documented in the medical record that patient # 22 remained shackled with police present, patient not fighting restraints, not agitated or aggressive.  Further documentation showed ""Psych plan is to transfer to [Hospital B] tomorrow.""   ... ""Have IM (intra-muscular) meds if needed for agitated (sic) but really is calm at this time.""

Review of St. Luke's census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 20 inpatients on 2 East psychiatric unit (10 available beds) on 11/22/16 and three available beds on the additionally secured North hall.

On day three of patient # 22's stay in the ED (11/23/16) at 6:35 AM, Staff J, Licensed Independent Social Worker (LISW) documented in the medical record that "". . . Patient up and down throughout the night but able to be redirected when awake.""

At 7:50 AM on 11/23/16, ED Registered Nurse (RN) F documented in patient # 22's medical record that St. Luke's would discharge the patient later today after a court order for admission to Hospital B was obtained.  Further documentation showed that staff at Hospital B told ED nurse F that they did not have any available beds.  

At 12:20 PM an ED physician documented that ""no acute concerns voiced during my period of care  ...""  ""I am concerned about this delay in care and the fact that he (patient # 22) has been restrained for so long.""  ""He isn't 'combative' per chart/notes, but occasionally verbally disruptive so not overly concerned about rhabdo (rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome whereby dissolution of skeletal muscle is caused by direct or indirect muscle injury), etc just his autonomy.""  ""I discussed this with the Linn County deputy [name] at 1220 who states that it is their policy and that they 'have to' keep him shackled and handcuffed unless we are doing a procedure.""  

At 12:35 PM on 11/23/16 an ED nurse documented in the medical record that he informed St. Luke's Behavioral Health Director that Hospital B reported they did not have any available beds.  Further documentation showed that the Behavioral Health Director ""replied that if they show up at [Hospital B] with the patient, it has been his past experience that [Hospital B] will 'find a bed.'"" Further documentation showed that the Behavioral Health Director ""directed that transportation be called to transfer."" 

At 12:45 pm, the ED nurse documented that staff at Hospital B ""continues to state that they do not have a bed available at this time.""

Review of St. Luke's census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 20 inpatients on 2 East psychiatric unit on 11/23/16 (10 available beds) and four available beds on the North hall.

During an interview on 1/5/17 at 10:20 AM, Other Staff AA, Linn County Mental Health Advocate, stated Patient #22 could get very violent but this time the patient was not anywhere near as violent as in the past.  

Review of Hospital B's medical record revealed patient # 22 arrived on 11/23/16, was admitted     to an open unit with other patients and did not require restraints or additional security.    

The evidence in the medical record indicated St. Luke's Hospital did not provide within its capabilities and capacity stabilizing treatment to patient # 22 who had an un-stabilized emergency medical condition from 11/20/16 through 11/23/16. The hospital's on-call psychiatrist documented refusal for inpatient admission on 11/22/16 and sought a court order for transfer to another acute psychiatric hospital even though beds were available in the psychiatric unit along with the presence of law enforcement and/or hospital security in the event patient # 22's behavior became violent.    

4. Review of a closed medical record showed that patient # 29(A) (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:42 am complaining of increased shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness and profuse vaginal bleeding since last night (11/27/16).  Documentation by the Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) S at 10:20 am indicated patient # 29(A) had a previous admission to St. Luke's Hospital in October for treatment of a blood clot in her lung and right lower extremity and received a prescription for Xarelto (blood thinner) at that time.  Further documentation showed that patient # 29(A) reported being lightheaded when getting out of bed this morning and had a large gush of blood from her vagina with several clots.  Patient # 29(A) also reported having an appointment to see her OB/GYN (obstetrician/gynecologist) in one month.  In the ED notes, ED nurse Q documented that patient # 29(A) had a large amount of bright red vaginal bleeding with clots present; that patient # 29(A) appeared dyspneic (difficulty breathing) with even mild exertion; was pale, cool to the touch with dry mucous membranes that were also pale; and reported mild to moderate low pelvic discomfort. 
 
During the examination, ARNP S documented there was bleeding in the patient's vagina.  Blood for testing obtained at 10:36 am showed that patient # 29(A) had an abnormally low hemoglobin of 8.5 (normal 12.2-15.6 g/dL).   At 10:06 a.m., ARNP S ordered one-liter bolus (rapid infusion) of normal saline intravenous (IV) fluid.  At 10:08 a.m., patient # 29(A) underwent a trans-vaginal ultrasound, which identified multiple uterine abnormalities.  Further documentation indicated ARNP S contacted the on-call OB/GYN who requested to see the patient in their office tomorrow (11/29/16) at 1:45 p.m. for an endometrial biopsy.   
 
At 1:10 pm ED nurse Q documented patient # 29(A) got up, went to the bathroom to change her peri pad, and reported she was ""bleeding again,"" but is manageable at this point.""  At 1:42 pm patient # 29(A) was discharged    with instructions to follow up with gynecology the next day for a biopsy, and to return if bleeding continued.  

The medical record did not contain evidence that the hospital stabilized patient # 29(A)'s emergency medical condition, active bleeding while taking an anticoagulation (blood thinning) medication, prior to discharge from the ED.  
 
5. Review of a second closed medical record indicated patient # 29(B) returned to the ED by ambulance at 9:11 pm on 11/28/17, approximately 7 hours after discharge for continued vaginal bleeding.  Documentation in the medical record on the Pre-Hospital Care Report Summary indicated patient # 29(B) requested transport to St. Luke's Hospital.  Upon arrival, the paramedics documented patient # 29(B) was pale, sweating, had a low blood pressure 108/palpable - meaning the diastolic pressure was too low to determine (normal 120/80), a rapid heart rate of 134 (normal 70-100) and were unable to establish intravenous (IV) access.  Further documentation showed the patient arrived at the ED at 9:08 pm on 11/28/17.

ED physician R documented patient # 29(B) had a history of blood clots in the lungs, had been prescribed long term use of anticoagulant medication (to prevent blood clots from forming) and was currently experiencing uterine bleeding possibly due to cancer.  Further documentation showed patient # 29(B) stated she was scheduled to have a biopsy tomorrow with OB (obstetrics) for concerns of cancer.  At 9:21 pm, blood obtained for testing indicated patient # 29(B)'s hemoglobin was 7.3 g/dL down from 8.5 g/dL prior to discharge from the ED earlier in the day.  The ED physician ordered 2 units of blood for immediate transfusion.  Further documentation showed the ED physician R talked to the gynecologist on-call, ""he recommended that the patient be transferred to Hospital D for further evaluation and treatment.""   During the blood transfusion at 11:12 pm, patient # 29(B) was transferred to Hospital D.    
 
The evidence in the medical record indicated patient # 29(B) had an emergency medical condition (EMC) that was not stabilized within the hospital's capabilities, continued blood loss while taking a blood thinning medication.  The benefits of transfer were ""need for diagnostic equipment/tests"" which did not outweigh the risks of ""bleeding/shock; loss of limb and/or fracture complications; additional delay in receiving appropraite treatment"" as documented in the medical record.  The on-call GYN physician did not come to the ED to examine the patient.  St. Luke's Hospital had the capabilities including but not limited to, 532 hospital beds, an on-call GYN physician, an on-call surgeon, on-call hospitalists, a cancer treatment center, a medical/surgical intensive care unit, and diagnostic radiology services.

Based on interviews, review of Facility #1's video surveillance footage, review of Facility #1's Emergency Department (ED) registration logbook and policies, and review of medical records from Facility #2 and Facility #3, it was determined the facility failed to ensure a medical examination and stabilizing medical treatment were provided for one (1) of twenty-one (21) sampled patients (Patient #1) that presented to Facility #1's Emergency Department (ED) for treatment.  

Interviews and review of Facility #1's ED video footage revealed Patient #1's family member (MDS) dated [DATE] and informed ED Registration Clerk #2 that Patient #1 was in the parking lot, in labor, and ready to push.  ED Registration Clerk #2 informed Patient #1's family member that Facility #1 did not offer Obstetric (OB) services and no longer employed any OB nurses.  Interviews revealed Patient #1's family left Facility #1 with Patient #1; however, review of Facility #1's ED log revealed no documented evidence that Patient #1 ever (MDS) dated [DATE].  Interviews and record review revealed after leaving Facility #1, Patient #1's family member drove to Facility #2 (a critical access hospital 16 miles away), and the patient delivered Twin A in the parking lot and Twin B in the ED of Facility #2.  Facility #2 then transferred Patient #1, Twin A, and Twin B to Facility #3 (18 miles away).  Facility #3 admitted     and assessed the patients, but arranged for Twin A and Twin B to be transferred to Facility #4 (89 miles away) due to their inability to provide the level of care the twins required.  Patient #1 was treated at Facility #3 for Undiagnosed    Pregnancy, Previous Cesarean Section, Precipitous Delivery of Twins, Postpartum Bleeding, Severe Anemia, and Uterine Blood Clots and was discharged    on [DATE].  Attempts to obtain the twins' medical records from Facility #4 were unsuccessful.

Based on interviews and review of the facility's Labor and Delivery Logbook, medical records, and facility policies, it was determined the facility failed to ensure stabilizing medical treatment was provided for one (1) of twenty (20) sampled patients (Patient #1) that presented to the facility's Labor and Delivery (L&D) Department for an Emergency Medical Condition.  

Interviews revealed Patient #1 presented to the L&D on 09/11/16 with a complaint of active labor.  Patient #1 was taken to a room and provided with a medical screening by Registered Nurse (RN) #1 and informed she was dilated to one (1) centimeter.  Patient #1's family member stated RN #1 informed her that the patient's Obstetrician (OB) (Physician #1) did not deliver at Facility #1 and RN #1 would contact the OB on call (Physician #2).  Physician #2 did not return RN #1's calls and Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) #1 was contacted.  APRN #1 gave RN #1 an order to ""discharge [Patient #1] to [Facility #2]"" (23 miles away) where Physician #1 would deliver the baby.  At approximately 11:15 AM, RN #3 assessed Patient #1 and found the patient to be ""dilated to 3.""  RN #1 and RN #3 failed to contact APRN #1 with the change in Patient #1's condition.  Patient #1 left Facility #1 in a privately owned vehicle and arrived at Facility #2 at 12:14 PM.  Patient #1 delivered by Caesarean section at 1:38 PM due to fetal intolerance of labor.

Based on interview and document review the facility failed to complete an appropriate medical screening exam for two (#1, #2) of 24 patients reviewed for treatment and medical screening presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) resulting in the potential to delay care and less than optimal patient outcomes. Findings include:

On 11/16/2021 at 1440 it was revealed a patient (#2) arrived to the ED on 10/19/2021 and had left the ED after being asked to wear a mask. 

On 11/17/2021 at 1245 an interview occurred with staff O, the patient access representative on 10/19/2021. Staff O was queried about patient #2 arriving at the ED for emergency services. Staff O stated the patient #2 refused to wear a mask in order to be seen in the ED. Staff O was asked why the patient (#2) had presented to the ED. Staff O stated that she remembered that the patient had stated that she was possibly pregnant and thought she might have been experiencing problems. Staff O was asked if the patient was triaged and if she had a medical screening exam. Staff O stated that since the patient was unwilling to comply with wearing a mask that the patient left the facility without being triaged or having a medical screening exam. Staff O was then queried if there was an alternative to wearing a mask for individuals presenting to the ED. Staff O stated, ""They can wear a face shield if they provide a doctor's note stating they could not wear a mask.""

Video requested from the ED for 10/19/2021 at 1730 to 1800 was provided. Document review of the video occurred on 11/17/2021 at 1500. During the document review of the video footage of 10/19/2021 at 1740 it was revealed patient #2 entered the facility and stopped at the greeter's station. Patient #2 was observed presenting to the registration area and conversing with someone behind the glass partition. The patient was then seen going back to the vestibule where the greeter's station is located and returning to the registration area. The patient (#2) was accompanied by two additional people (a male and a female). At 1743 the patient stood up and took her mask off, which was located below her nose and threw the mask in the garbage. 

On 11/18/2021 at 1300 a document review occurred of the policy titled, """"EMTALA: Treatment of

Pain assessment noted as ""Denies pain/discomfort""

Further review revealed a second assessment of vital signs that occurred 5 hours and 7 minutes later, as the patient was prepared for discharge home. Discharge vital signs were all within normal limits. No other documentation is present indicating Pt.#1's progress nor the location where Pt.#1 was treated.

Review of document ""emergency room    Report"" dated 08/12/21 lists Staff N as Pt. #1's attending physician. The report begins with an Addendum dated 08/14/21 at  0922, authored by Staff N, and reads as follows:

"" called the mother back on 08/14/21 to check on the child. Mother informed me that the child appeared to be getting sicker instead of coming back to the emergency department she went to (Facility B) Medical Center (where) the child was diagnosed    with DKA (diabetic keto-acidosis). Is no family history of diabetes. Patient was not having any nausea vomiting for our visit. Nor was he having any significant urinary symptoms. The case had also been discussed with Dr. (Staff M) and she was apprised of the patient's up-to-date as well.""

Based on staff interview, medical record review, and facility policy and procedure review the facility failed to provide necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition on 01/23/2022 during emergency department (ED) visit for one (1) of 20 patient charts reviewed:  Patient #1.

Findings Include:

A phone interview on 02/16/2022 at 10:55 a.m. with Patient #1 revealed she returned to the emergency department (ED) a third (3rd) time on 01/23/2022 with increased pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, and concerns of internal bleeding.  Patient #1 reported she only had lab work done and no other testing or examinations were performed, and she asked again about possible internal bleeding but was told to follow up with her Obstetrician /Gynecologist (OBGYN) the next day.  Patient #1 reported on 1/26/2022 that her pain became unbearable, so she went to a different hospital, Facility #2.  Patient #1 reported the physician told her, ""she was in bad shape and needed surgery.""   Patient #1 reported she had a six (6) centimeter (cm) blood clot in her fallopian tube from the [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and she had to have emergency surgery to remove the fallopian tube and clean out all the blood.  Patient #1 reported the physician told her she ""was messed up and could have died   ."" Patient #1 reported she was discharged    on [DATE] with a drain in her surgical site.  Patient #1 reported the physician was very concerned about the care she had received prior to coming to Facility #2.  Patient #1 reported she is very concerned and upset that no one ever actually checked her at her OBGYN clinic and that on her last visit on 01/23/2022 to Hospital #1 the physician in the ED refused to consult OBGYN and did not do a thorough examination, only lab work.  Patient stated, ""All of this could have been prevented if they would have just done their job.""  Patient #1 stated she did go to all her follow-up visits (12/30/21, 01/04/2022, 01/7/2022, 01/20/2022, 01/24/2022) with her OBGYN, but they only drew blood each time and she never saw a doctor.    

An interview on 02/16/2022 at 3:00 p.m. with ED Physician, Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) (on duty 01/23/2022 who treated Patient #1), revealed he felt like this wasn't an emergent situation for 01/23/2022 ED visit.  The ED Physician reported the patient was scheduled to be seen the next day 01/24/2022 by her OBGYN.  The ED Physician said the patient reported she had been followed closely by her OBGYN over the past month.  The ED Physician reported there is no protocol for low hemoglobin and hematocrit or [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] because they are treated per provider judgement.  The ED Physician stated, ""if there were all those protocols there would have been no need for me to go to medical school.""  The ED Physician reported the patient told him her pain was better than it was three (3) days prior to the ED visit.  The ED Physician reported he did not consult an obstetrician (OB) physician or order an ultrasound because nothing indicated she needed that.  The ED Physician reported her hemoglobin and hematocrit were low, but orthostatic blood pressures were normal which indicated no major blood loss.  

An interview on 02/17/2022 at 10:05 a.m. with Registered Nurse (RN) #1, confirmed she did not remember this patient, but reviewed the chart and the hemoglobin and hematocrit were not critical and her orthostatic blood pressures were normal at the 01/23/2022 ED visit.  RN #1 reported normally the patient would go to surgery if the [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] was diagnosed    in the ED, but the OBGYN was consulted and that they had decided to give the Methotrexate instead on the 12/27/2021 ED visit.

An interview on 02/17/2022 at 12:55 p.m. with the ED Director revealed he remembered giving the patient Methotrexate on 12/27/2021 ED visit because they don't do that very often.  The ED Director reported he has seen both surgical and medical treatment of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] with patients.  The ED Director reported, ""in this case the patient already had an appointment the next day,01/24/2022 and lab values weren't critical and vital signs were within normal limits, so she was referred to her Obstetrician for her follow-up the next day 01/24/2022.""

A medical record review of Patient #1's third (3rd) visit to the Emergency Department (ED) on 01/23/2022 revealed the patient arrived by private vehicle at 8:06 a.m. with complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness.  The patient's vital signs were obtained at 8:20 a.m. and were within normal limits.  The medical record review of the ED Physician's report revealed the patient complained of "" ...abdominal pain, lightheadedness, and concerns for the fact that she may be ""bleeding internally""  ...""  A review of the ED physician's assessment dated  [DATE] revealed the patient had abdominal tenderness to the left lower quadrant and to the right lower quadrant.  The medical record review revealed the ED Physician ordered labs as follows: complete blood count (CBC), HCG quantitative, orthostatic blood pressure's (B/P) and urinalysis (U/A) with culture if indicated.  A review of the medical record revealed that the patient's lab results were as follows: Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) has decreased from 4.32 on 12/27/2021 to 3.35 on 01/23/2022, Hemoglobin (Hgb) has decreased from 11.8 on 12/27/2021 to 9.2 on 01/23/2022, Hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 36.0 on 12/27/2021 to 27.9 on 01/23/2022, Platelets have increased from 303 on 12/27/2021 to 449 on 01/23/2022, and Human Chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) quantitative has decreased from 7408 on 12/27/2021 to 677.8 on 01/23/2022.  A review of the ED Physician's assessment revealed the physician discharged    Patient #1 to home and to follow up with her OBGYN the next day, 01/24/2022.  The medical record review revealed there was no documented evidence of an OBGYN consult made on this visit or a comparable ultrasound completed.  The medical record revealed the patient was discharged    at 10:23 a.m. with instructions to follow up with her specialist as scheduled and return if symptoms get worse. 

A review of the medical record obtained from Facility #2 revealed the patient went for evaluation on 01/27/2022 and was admitted on [DATE] with a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  

Review of the consultation note from 01/27/2022 revealed the patient had a ruptured left [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The surgical note review revealed the hematoma was evacuated, and the left fallopian tube was removed.  A medical record review of the discharge summary revealed the patient was discharged    home on 01/29/2022 with  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]].  
Review of facility policy entitled ""Emergency Department Triage Policy"" (Reviewed/Revised 9/28/2016) revealed "" ...URGENT ...3. A rule-out [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] when patient is hemodynamically stable ...13. If an emergency medical condition does exist: 13.1 ...treatment will be initiated as medically appropriate ...including all ancillary services ...to ensure that -13.1.1 The patient's condition is stabilized ..."".

Procedure: ...All patients in the waiting room will be reassessed every 2 hours to include a complete set of vital signs and pain assessment. Triage is neither a diagnostic process nor a medical stability screen. A medical screening must be offered to every patient who presents for care...""


Review of the facility's ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)"" policy (Effective 09/1989; Last Revised 04/2016) revealed: ""Policy: ...1. If any individual... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital should provide for an appropriate medical screening examination, performed by a qualified medical person, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.... Definitions:... B. Emergency Medical Condition: 1. A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, ...) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could  reasonably  be expected to result in either: a. Placing the health of an individual (or, with respect of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy. b. Serious impairment to bodily functions. c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part... Procedure: A. Medical Screening Examination  1.

The Pharmacy will now do all medications and four  Patient Care Technicians were approved to be hired.  The announcements were finalized and the jobs posted on 06/07/2016 and we've already had four applications.  The facility has revised their policies to address this issue, however the policies have not been approved as yet. ""  When asked if they were aware if any of the facility staff has ever told the patients their wait time would be a couple of hours, the Director of Emergency Services stated that she does not believe her staff would ever do that.  ""However, as a courtesy if the wait is longer I ask the triage nurse, when she does the reassessment, to apologize to the patient and reassure them they will be seen. In addition I have instructed them several times to never give a wait time.  All staff has been trained on this.""   The ED Director stated,  ""I would like to add that as of this morning there was eight patients left over for the morning shift to see, 27 scheduled surgeries, 10 patients in the cath lab and their floor census this morning is 180.""

Review of the facility's ""Triage Assessment"" policy (effective 06/2011; revised and approved 2/2016) revealed,  ""Affected Departments: Nursing - Emergency Department. Purpose: To promote patient safety by establishing the priority of care based on the physical and psychosocial needs of each patient presenting to the ED for treatment and to facilitate the flow of patients through the ED... Procedure: ...All patients in the waiting room will be reassessed every 2 hours to include a complete set of vital signs and pain assessment. Triage is neither a diagnostic process nor a medical stability screen. A medical screening must be offered to every patient who presents for care...""


Review of the facility's ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)"" policy (Effective 09/1989; Last Revised 04/2016) revealed: ""Policy: ...1. If any individual... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital should provide for an appropriate medical screening examination, performed by a qualified medical person, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.... Definitions:... B. Emergency Medical Condition: 1. A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, ...) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could  reasonably  be expected to result in either: a. Placing the health of an individual (or, with respect of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy. b. Serious impairment to bodily functions. c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part... Procedure: A. Medical Screening Examination  1.

Purpose: To promote safety by appropriately managing the medical needs of obstetrical patients presenting to the emergency department.  Policy: It is the policy of (Hospital) to give a medical screening examination to all obstetrical patients presenting to the emergency department...  Procedure: A. Obstetrical patients at less than 20 weeks gestation should receive a medical screening in the Emergency Department. Fetal heart tones should be assessed in patients who are at least twelve (12) weeks gestation, to determine fetal well-being as part of the treatment process...""


                  		                    
CONCLUSION:
The complaint regarding Patient #7 not being seen by a physician while in Hospital #1's ED was substantiated and EMTALA violations were cited for the facility's failure to ensure this patient received a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) from a physician during the time she was in their facility, failure to ensure the patient received stabilizing treatment, failure to ensure the patient received no delay in treatment and failure to reassess the patient after two (2) hours as per their  ""Triage Assessment""  policy. 

Emergency Department Record Review during the course of the survey also revealed that the following patients did not receive a MSE or stabilizing treatment, received a delay in treatment, and were not reassessed every two (2) hours while in the hospital's ED:
Patient #2 - in ED for 8 hours and 44 minutes
Patient #6 - in ED for 2 hours and 37 minutes

_x000d_
Based on interview, record review, and policy review, SSM Health St Joseph Hospital failed to accept an appropriate transfer from another hospital's emergency department (Hospital A) for one patient (#1) of 28 Emergency Department (ED) records reviewed. This failure had the potential to cause harm by delaying stabilizing treatment to any emergent patient that required the specialized capabilities provided at SSM Health St. Joseph Hospital.  The ED average daily census was 97. The hospital received an average of 24 patients transferred in from other facilities per month. The facility census was 161. 

Findings included:

1. Record review of the facility's Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) policy titled, ""EMTALA"", dated July 2008, showed that, ""Patients appropriately transferred from another hospital anywhere within the boundaries of the United States for specialized care, i.e., Obstetrics (OB), Psychiatry, Pediatrics or Trauma must be accepted if this facility has the capacity to treat the patient. It may be requested of the transferring facility to consider more acceptable alternatives (that is a hospital with specialized capabilities within closer proximity); however if the transferring facility still desires to transfer the patient to this facility, the patient must be accepted.""

Record review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, revised 07/27/15, and the Medical Staff By-Laws, dated 09/23/13, showed no direction to medical staff related to acceptance of transferred patients. 

2. Record review of Patient #1's ED (referring Hospital A) visit dated 10/02/15 showed the following:

- Administered acetaminophen (for fever), intravenous (IV) fluids, and an antibiotic;
- ED physician note indicated patient was 11 weeks pregnant with a several day history of fever, chills, and diffuse joint pain, patient was recently treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) by her OB Physician, (Hospital B, Physician M). Patient denied vaginal bleeding, spotting, back pain, cramping, rash, lesions, nausea or vomiting.
- ED physician performed bedside Ultrasound (type of imaging that utilizes sound waves to look at internal organs and structures in the body) and noted fetal heart rate of 210 (normal for 11 week fetus is 120 to 160) and a live fetus.
- Laboratory tests showed urine contained protein, blood, white blood cells, red blood cells and leukocytes (indication of infection). Blood test showed blood urea nitrogen (BUN, a kidney function test) with a value of six (normal range 8 to 24), and potassium (K, a mineral in the blood) with a value of 3.2 (normal range 3.5 to 5.1).
- ED Physician L spoke to OB Physician F (a partner of patients regular OB physician) at receiving Hospital B and noted that Physician F refused transfer and to contact ""medicine"".
- The ED physician noted he spoke with Staff I (House Supervisor at receiving hospital), who stated that she was aware of attempt to transfer the patient and confirmed that they refused to accept the patient. ED Physician explained that patient was a patient of a physician in their facility and had a fever, tachycardia (rapid heart beat), a UTI resistant to antibiotics and that his facility had no OB coverage. Staff I expressed that they still refused to accept the transfer.
- Patient #1 was transferred to a different facility (Hospital C) with diagnoses of fever of undetermined origin, pregnant and abnormal fetal heart rate.

- She stated that the usual course for an 11 week pregnant patient, without OB symptoms, would be to admit to Hospitalist and have a consult by OB;
- She did not recall a conversation about fetal heart tones or rate but that she usually always asked about this when discussing an OB patient.

3. During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 10:05 AM, Registered Nurse H (RN), SSM Health St Joseph Hospital access line (a dedicated telephone line where staff coordinated calls between physicians wanting to transfer patients into this system), stated that:
- She received a request from ED Physician L at Hospital A, to speak to the OB physician on call for Staff M.

- He stated that the access line RN advised him that the OB Physician had refused to accept this transfer and that the patient had recently seen her primary OB for an office visit. 
- Staff K stated that the Hospitalist doesn't typically accept OB patients, they generally were admitted     directly to the OB doctors, so he had to check with Staff G, (Hospitalist on call) to get direction. 
- After speaking with Staff G he called the access line back and advised them to refuse the transfer for admission. 
- Staff K stated that he never spoke directly with the ED Physician. Staff K stated that he could not add anything to the situation so he let the access line RN call the ED back. 
- Staff K stated that he did not recall ever refusing a transfer for a service that was offered at this hospital. 

During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 9:05 AM, Hospitalist G, stated that:

OB physician (Staff F) was on call for Staff M (patient's regular OB physician) and refused the admission. Staff H called our Physician Assistant (Staff K), who spoke with Staff G (on call Hospitalist), who also refused the admission as she wouldn't have OB to consult. 

During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 1:35 PM, Staff J, Chief Medical Officer, stated that he was made aware of the situation that occurred earlier on that morning (10/02/15) but did not explore it any further because he received a report that the patient did not need admission, so there was nothing to follow up.

_x000d_
Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to provide a medical screening examination (MSE) sufficient to determine the presence of an emergency medical condition (EMC) for two patients (#7 and #8) of 20 Emergency Department (ED) patient records reviewed. The ED has an average of 2817 visits per month. 

Findings included:

1. Review of the facility's policy titled, ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA),"" dated 05/2016, showed that:
- A physician or nurse practitioner will perform a MSE on every patient presenting to the ED requesting emergency medical treatment in a uniform manner to determine if an EMC exists. 
- If after the MSE, an EMC is deemed to exist, the hospital will provide medical treatment within its capacity and capabilities to stabilize that EMC. 
- A patient is stable for discharge when (for psychiatric patients) it is determined the patient is no longer considered a threat to himself/herself or others. 

2. Review of Patient #7's ED record showed he (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:37 PM, with complaints of ""feeling suicidal right now."" Staff C, Registered Nurse (RN), documented that the patient felt hopeless and helpless because his wife wanted a divorce and thought she may be pregnant. Staff B, ED Physician, documented that the patient had a history of depression without previous thoughts of suicide, and when he asked the patient if he wanted to be admitted     for psychiatric care or discharged    with outpatient treatment and medication, and the patient chose to be discharged    home. The patient was discharged    at 11:33 PM, less than one hour after he arrived. 

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 11:40 AM, Staff C, RN, stated that Patient #7 ""had no tools to work though the situation."" Staff C stated that psychiatric SW was on-call and available for evaluation, which was used from time to time when ""they (the patients) say the right things."" Staff C added that neither psychiatric SW nor the on-call psychiatrist were called in or consulted for Patient #7, and the patient was discharged   .

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 12:54 PM, Staff D, ED Physician stated that Patient #7 had thoughts of suicide but Staff D didn't feel that the patient was at risk to himself. ""I did not feel that he was suicidal. I believe that he was melancholy because his wife didn't want him anymore. He was feeling useless and not important to his wife."" Staff D informed the patient that a local community behavioral health office offered walk-in clinics, prescribed the patient medications, and discharged    the patient, who walked home. Staff D stated that he had the ability to consult with a psychiatrist but did not, that the only time psychiatric SW could be accessed after hours was for psychiatric transfers that required a 96 hour court ordered hold, and even if they were available, he would not have consulted them for Patient #7.  

During an interview on 06/04/18 at 1:00 PM, Staff H, Psychiatrist, stated he was not consulted on Patient #7 when he came to the ED.. 

Review of a March 2018 Physician Call Coverage Schedule, showed that a psychiatrist was on-call and available to the ED on 03/09/18. A note at the bottom of the call schedule showed that Staff H, Psychiatrist, could be contacted for emergencies.

Review of a Psychiatric SW schedule showed that a SW was on-call and available to the ED on 03/09/18.

3. Review of court documents showed that on 03/19/18, an application for evaluation was obtained for Patient #8, after the patient obtained injuries that were not present prior to his placement in an isolated cell (indicates they were self-inflicted), and then spread feces on his wounds and stated it was a process for healing. A court-ordered 96-hour detention was issued for Patient #8 to be detained, evaluated and treated for up to 96 hours by the local hospital, unless further detention and treatment was necessary.

Review of Patient #8's ED record, showed he (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:50 AM, in custody from a local jail with a 96-hour court-ordered hold. The patient had a psychiatric history of depression with patient reported psychosis (a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality), and intermittent ""strange behavior"" for the previous two weeks while incarcerated. He refused food or drink and would not sleep while he was in the ""hole"" (isolated jail cell), and would insert his finger into his rectum and wipe feces on himself. Staff E, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse-Certified Nurse Practitioner (APRN-CNP), did not find the patient to be suicidal, homicidal or psychotic, and documented that jail staff escorts were informed that it may be a long wait to admit the patient to the behavioral health unit, and instructed them that one of the jail staff would need to stay with the patient until admission occurred. Staff E further documented that jail staff contacted their supervisor and chose to leave with the patient, who was fit for confinement (absence of a medical or psychiatric emergency).

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 10:17 AM, Staff I, ED RN stated that Patient #8 was upset and had made some comments while in jail about suicide, and had placed his finger in his rectum and wiped feces on himself. The patient was not evaluated by a psychiatric SW or psychiatrist. and was discharged    to jail staff to return another time for further care. ""Apparently this happens frequently at night. They will send patients with 96 hour holds back to jail."" Staff I was unaware if the patient ever returned for inpatient psychiatric care.

During an interview on 06/05/18 at 9:24 AM, County Jail Administrator J, stated that Patient #8 was evaluated at the hospital ED, and ""they sent him back. He never received inpatient (psychiatric) care.""

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 1:51 PM, Staff E, APRN-CNP, stated that Patient #8 presented to the ED from jail, with a 96-hour court-ordered hold, a history of depression and substance abuse, as well as patient reported psychosis (abnormal thinking and perceptions). The patient had been in solitary (""the hole"", isolated cell), and while in solitary, refused to eat, drink or take his medications, and had spread feces on himself. Staff E stated that she did not believe the patient was actively psychotic, suicidal or homicidal, but needed to see a psychiatrist. There wasn't an available bed on the behavioral health unit, ""we were busy,"" and didn't know how long it would be before a psychiatric bed was available for the patient, so the patient was discharged    and the jail staff took the patient back to jail. The patient was not seen by the on-call psychiatrist or psychiatric SW, and Staff E did not know if the patient was ever returned to the hospital for psychiatric care. Staff E added that ED physicians and APRN-CNPs could evaluate psychiatric patients and override a 96-hour court-ordered hold, but she did not override Patient #8's. 

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 12:20 PM, Staff J, ED Physician, stated that he saw Patient #8, who was confused, but was not psychotic. ""We decided that he needed psychiatric help, but they (jail staff) wanted to take him (back to jail). They have secure facilities, specialized area that is safe ....He would be safe in the area that he was going to."" Staff J stated that ED Physicians could fulfill a psychiatric evaluation for a 96-hour court-ordered hold, but other times, it required more evaluation than just the ED Physician. Staff J added that the facility had psychiatric SW that could be utilized, or the on-call psychiatrist. 

During an interview on 06/04/18 at 1:00 PM, Staff H, Psychiatrist, stated that:
- When Patient #8 came to the ED under a 96-hour hold, the fact that there was not an available bed at the time shouldn't matter, and that jail staff could have stayed with the patient until he was place in the locked unit. 
- Ideally, it was ""best to bring everyone into the psychiatric unit.""
- Psychiatric SW or the on-call psychiatrist were available for consult. 

Review of a Psychiatric SW schedule showed that a SW was on-call and available to the ED on 03/22/18.

Review of a March 2018 Physician Call Coverage Schedule, showed that a psychiatrist was on-call and available to the ED on 03/22/18. 

The facility failed to provide an appropriate MSE to Patients #7 and #8, when they failed to utilize psychiatric SW and/or and on-call psychiatrist, in the evaluation of patients who presented with  psychiatric presentation.

The OB Department averaged 40 patients each month.

Findings included:

Review of the hospital's policy titled, ""Lebanon Labor EMTALA,"" dated 01/23/20, showed that if the hospital determines that an individual has a medical emergency, it must stabilize the condition or provide for an appropriate transfer.  The decision to transport is determined by factors that may include but are not limited to gestational age less than 36 weeks, the stage of labor, the medical status of the mother or the fetus (unborn child), and the availability of services required.  The transferring physician certifies in writing that the benefits expected from the treatment at another facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or unborn child from the transfer.  The hospital is obligated to assure and document that the patient has been provided information regarding the hospital's obligation for examination and treatment, the risks/benefit ratio of the proposed transfer, and a signed informed consent.

Review of Ambulance #1's report, dated 09/14/20, showed that an ambulance was dispatched to a residence for a [AGE]-year-old female who was suffering from abdominal pain.  The ambulance arrived at the scene at 6:58 PM, and the crew documented that Patient #4 was pregnant, complained of lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back, and that she had a sensation to push and ""pee"".  The ambulance arrived at the hospital's OB unit on 09/14/20, at 7:27 PM.

Review of the medical record, showed that Patient #4, a [AGE]-year-old uninsured female pregnant at 23 weeks, 5 days gestation arrived at the hospital's obstetrical unit on 9/14/2020 at 7:30 PM in active preterm labor and placed in outpatient observation (not admitted     to the hospital as an inpatient).  At 9:08 PM, OB physician I documented under ""OB History and Physical"" that patient # 4 ""is feeling a regular pelvic cramping but states that it is severe in nature.""  Further documentation showed ""Of note, the patient has (sic) not a current patient of the Mercy OB/GYN system and has an outside provider and (sic) Rolla.""  Under ""Physical Exam"" OB physician I documented he performed a sterile vaginal exam and that the patient had ""Bulging amniotic membranes, unable to fully evaluate cervix.""  OB physician I performed a speculum exam and documented ""Unable to complete based on bulging membranes.""  Under ""Assessment/Plan""  OB physician I documented ""Advanced preterm labor""  - ""Patient with exam findings consistent with advanced cervical dilation and bulging fetal membranes.""  ""High risk of imminent delivery.""  Further documentation showed OB physician I ordered a medication (Procardia) to suppress patient # 4's premature labor, a medication (BMZ 12 mgn) used to mature lung function in fetuses at risk for preterm delivery, an antibiotic medication (Ancef ) to prevent group B streptococcus infection in a newborn, an infusion of magnesium sulfate to aid in slowing preterm labor and to prevent injuries to a preterm baby's brain, and then began the process of arranging transfer to Hospital B's Labor and Delivery unit located 150 miles away.   

At 10:45 PM OB physician I documented that patient # 4 ""has advanced cervical dilation and is currently not actively contracting""  and that Hospital B had agreed to accept the transfer at 10:22 PM.  Under ""Details of Transfer"" OB physician I documented that the ambulance transporting patient # 4 to Hospital B was equipped with basic life support equipment (meaning the ambulance did not have the appropriate equipment for managing advanced life support or a preterm delivery).  Under ""Transfer Benefits"" OB physician I documented that Hospital B had an available Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and under ""Transfer Risks"" OB physician I documented ""Delivery en route, Miscarriage, Worsening vaginal bleeding, Progression of labor, Fetal demise, Increased pain."" 

Review of Ambulance #2's report, dated 09/14/20, indicated that the ambulance crew arrived at Patient #4's bedside on the hospital OB unit at 11:39 PM.  The ambulance crew documented that the Registered Nurse (RN) stated the patient was 23-weeks pregnant and (MDS) dated [DATE], at 7:30 PM with complaint of contractions, and that this was her first pregnancy.  The RN stated that Patient #4 was on Magnesium Sulfate (a medication used to prevent seizures in pregnancy) and Lactated Ringers (intravenous fluid that contains electrolytes) infusion.  ""RN states patient is in stable condition & has had no recent contractions, however, upon making patient contact patient started to c/o (complain of) having contractions.""  ""RN made visual inspection to find no crowning.""  Further documentation showed that at 36.9 miles into the 150 miles transport, at 12:22 AM on 9/15/2020 patient # 4 precipitously delivered in the ambulance forcing the ambulance crew to emergently divert to the closest hospital (Hospital D, a military health system hospital).  

Review of a 9/15/2020 air ambulance trip report dispatched to Hospital D at 7:14 AM showed that patient # 4 ""was being transported by ground ambulance to an outside hospital (Hospital B) and precipitously delivered a 23 week fetus in an ambulance prior to arrival.""  ""Patient arrived to the outside hospital (Hospital D) 10 minutes later and had an estimated blood loss of greater than 500 mls (1/2 liter).""  Further documentation showed a critical care transport team transported patient # 4 and her newborn baby to Hospital E for further stabilizing treatment.   

Review of the hospital provided emailed documents dated 11/09/20, at 5:04 PM, showed that OB nursing staff had successfully completed the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) curriculum of the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association for resuscitating infants who are not breathing or have a pulse at the time of delivery and/or immediately afterwards.    
- Staff H, Primary OB RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 11/30/2020.
- Staff J, RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 06/30/2021.
- Staff M, Secondary OB RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 09/30/2022.

During an interview on 09/16/20 at 4:45 PM, Staff F, OB and Nursery Manager, stated that she would not have let Patient #4 be transferred with a bulging bag and complete dilation of the cervix. She had called Hospital C (60 miles away), in the past, and they had sent the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU, unit for premature and ill newborns) team, when a baby had been delivered at the hospital and needed resuscitation.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 9:34 AM, Staff L, experienced OB/GYN, (on staff at the hospital for eight years and had a total of 35 years of experience, but not involved in Patient #4's care) stated that in his professional opinion, Patient #4 should not have been transferred.  He had heard about Patient #4 being transferred, and he had discussed the event with Staff I, OB/GYN, the morning after the transfer occurred.

During a telephone interview on 09/23/20 at 11:05 AM, Staff U, OB RN, Hospital B, stated that: 
- She was the labor and delivery Charge Nurse on 09/14/20 and spoke to Staff I, OB/GYN, when he called about a patient that he wanted to transfer.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, told her that Patient #4 was a first time 23-week-pregnant female with a bulging bag.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that he was unsure of the cervical dilation due to the bulging bag, and was concerned about amniotomy (artificial rupture of the amniotic sac) upon exam, but the bag had not moved down since his initial exam.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that Patient #4 had been contracting and said, ""I don't have anything for neonatal resuscitation and I can't deliver her here.""
- She was concerned about Patient #4 riding in an ambulance, and told Staff I, OB/GYN, that she was concerned about a high-risk delivery, and offered the NICU team.  She gave Staff I, OB/GYN, the contact information for the high-risk specialty service, in case the resuscitation team was needed.
- Staff N, MFM, called Staff U, OB RN, Hospital B, to discuss the report of Patient #4 that she had received from Staff I, OB/GYN, because Staff N, MFM, thought the transport would be safe.
- She told Staff N, MFM, she was concerned that the transport of Patient #4 would not be safe because when she asked Staff I, OB/GYN, about checking the dilation of the cervix and the bulging bag, he had told her that he was unsure of the cervical dilation due to the bulging bag.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 7:54 AM, Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that:
- He examined Patient #4 and she was completely dilated with a bulging bag of water.
- Staff K, Pediatrician (a specialty physician focused on the care of babies, children, adolescents, and young adults), stated that babies usually go to Hospital B if they were 23 weeks.  The cut off for resuscitation was 23 weeks at the hospital.
- There was no contact made with Hospital C, which was 60 miles away, and had a NICU. Staff K, Pediatrician, told him that Hospital C did not do 23-week resuscitations and they could not handle a 23-week baby.
- He called the OB floor at Hospital B, and spoke to the Generalist OB, who did not accept the transfer, because Patient #4 was a high-risk delivery, and that was not his expertise.
- He called Staff N, MFM, on call at Hospital B, who specialized in high-risk deliveries, and asked, ""What would you do with a 23 week pregnant patient who has a bulging bag of water?"", and Staff N, MFM, said he could transfer Patient #4 to Hospital B.
- He offered to keep Patient #4 overnight, and then transport, but Staff N, MFM, told him he would not need to do that.  He could transfer Patient #4 now.
- He called Labor and Delivery at Hospital B, and spoke to Staff U, RN, who told him he could not transfer Patient #4.  He told Staff U, RN, that Staff N, MFM, recommended the transfer, and there were no other options. This hospital did not have the capabilities to care for a 23-week old baby that would require a stay in the NICU.
- He called to speak with the NICU Physician, (whose name he did not recall) at Hospital B, and requested them to send a crew of NICU doctors.
- The NICU Physician called back and stated that it was not feasible to have a NICU team sitting there when they had no idea when Patient #4 would deliver.  His recommendation was to transfer Patient #4 to where the NICU doctors were located at Hospital B.
- He spoke to Staff N, MFM, again, stating that Staff U, RN, told him he could not transfer Patient #4, even though she had recommended transfer, and the NICU Physician recommended transfer.  Staff N, MFM, told him that she would call and get Hospital B to accept the transport.

Review of Hospital Licensure data showed that Hospitals C and E, located approximately 60 miles from Mercy Hospital Lebanon had a 28 bed and 46 bed respectively, Level III Neonatal Intensive Care unit (Level IV is the highest level) capable of providing care to premature and critically ill infants.  Hospital E's capabilities include a neonatal transport team that provides transport for critically ill newborns to its NICU.  

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 7:35 AM, Staff H, Primary OB RN, stated that:
- She performed a vaginal exam and documented that Patient #4 was fully dilated with a bulging bag.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, had approval from Staff N, MFM, Hospital B, to transfer Patient #4.
- Staff U, RN, from Hospital B, called back and said that they would not take Patient #4.
- Staff N, MFM, called back and said it was okay to transfer Patient #4, even though Staff U, RN, said that it was not okay.
- She would not normally transport a fully dilated patient, because they can deliver at any time, but Hospital B said they would take Patient #4.

During a telephone interview on 09/17/20 at 10:08 AM, Staff M, Secondary OB RN, stated that:
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, call Staff N, MFM, and speak to her about transferring Patient #4.
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, speaking with Staff U, RN, from Hospital B, who did not want him to send Patient #4.
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, speaking with the Staff N, MFM, again, who told him to transfer Patient #4.
- Hospital D, called to get report on Patient #4, who had given birth en route to Hospital B, and this hospital was not aware that Patient #4 had delivered en route.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 8:38 AM, Staff K, Pediatrician, stated that:
- Staff I, OB/GYN, had examined Patient #4 and had discovered that she had bulging membranes and was fully dilated.
- He heard that Patient #4's contractions were not consistent.
- He witnessed the discussions that Staff I, OB/GYN, had with the generalist OB on call and Staff N, MFM, at Hospital B, and he was aware that the Staff N, MFM, had accepted the transfer of Patient #4.

During a telephone interview on 09/17/20 at 1:28 PM, Staff N, MFM, Hospital B, stated that:
- She received a call on 09/14/20, at 8:52 PM from Staff I, OB/GYN, stating that he had an urgent consult.
- Patient #4 was 23 weeks pregnant and had a bulging bag of water, but she was not aware of the cervical dilation.
- She then called the Hospitalist (physician whose primary professional focus in the general medical care of hospitalized    patients) to inform them of the transfer, and Staff U, RN, was with the Hospitalist at that time.
- At about 10:00 PM, she received another call from Staff I, OB/GYN, stating that he was having issues transferring Patient #4, because Staff U, RN, Hospital B, had told him he could not transfer Patient #4.
- She then called Staff U, RN, discussed Patient #4, and informed Staff U, RN, that she had accepted the transfer of Patient #4.
- She offered the NICU team, but Staff I, OB/GYN, declined, saying that the labor slowed and there was enough time to transfer.
- When asked if Patient #4 was stable for transfer, her response was that she could not speak to that because it was hard to predict with a bulging bag of fluid. 

During a telephone interview on 09/21/20 at 8:41 PM, Staff Q, Paramedic, Ambulance #1, stated that:
- Patient #4 was at her home, tearful, and stated she could not walk, so he carried her to the Emergency Medical System (EMS) cot. 
- Patient #4 was having contractions and he instructed her to tell him when it started and when it stopped.
- En route to the hospital, Patient #4 stated that she had to go to the bathroom, which was a possible sign of active labor, and wanted to push.  He informed Patient #4 that was not a good idea.

During a telephone interview on 09/23/20 at 9:02 AM, Staff S, Paramedic, Ambulance #2, stated that:
- He was told that Patient #4 was a first-time pregnant, [AGE] year old female who, at the time, was not having any contractions.
- Patient #4 was transferred to the EMS cot and complained of pain.  Patient #4 was examined by a nurse, who stated that there was no crowning.
- He was not aware of the extent of cervical dilation for Patient #4.
- Patient #4 complained that, ""the baby was going to come"".
- He monitored Patient #4 in the ambulance, but did not have equipment available to monitor the baby.  He did not have a cardiac monitor or oxygen for the baby.
- While en route, he delivered the baby who had a weak cry and was breathing. He suctioned the baby and gave her to Patient #4 to keep warm, until they arrived at Hospital D.

.
Based on review of the Emergency Department (ED) log on 10/12/11, the facility failed to maintain a central log that includes all patients who presented to Triage in the ED.

Findings:

Review of the electronic central ED log on 10/12/11 for the months of June 2011 to October 2011 revealed the central log was incomplete and did not include patients that were seen by the Triage nurse in the ED and sent to Labor and Delivery (L&D).  The L&D department log for the same period (MDS) dated [DATE] did not specify which patients came from the ED.

Review of medical records for Patients #22 and #24 indicated these patients (MDS) dated [DATE], but the ED log did not document that these patients were seen by the Triage nurse. 

The Outpatient/Observation record for Patient #22 documented she had (MDS) dated [DATE] and was transported from the ED via a wheelchair to L&D at 1320.  The ED log does not mention this patient. 

Review of the Outpatient/Observation record for Patient #24 indicated this pregnant woman (MDS) dated [DATE] and was taken in a wheelchair to L&D.  The ED log does not mention this patient. 
 
On 10/12/11 at 1030 during an onsite inspection of the ED the Registrars on duty stated ""when a patient presents to the ED for treatment we send them over to the Triage nurse.""

The facility's policy entitled ""Function of the Triage Nurse"" dated 01/2011 states: ""The Triage RN is the first professional contact with the patient and family at which time she/he makes initial assessment of the patient's condition.""

The facility's policy entitled ""Triage and Chart Flow System"" dated 01/2011 states: ""The triage RN is the first person to assess all the ambulatory patients who arrive to the Emergency Department.  The nurse determines urgency and priority of all patients and determines the resources required (e.g., L&D, Trauma Room, etc.).""  This assessment was not evident in the medical records for Patient  #22 and #24 and was not evident in the ED log.  

These findings were confirmed by Hospital Administration.

Based upon interview and document review the recipient hospital refused to accept Patient #1 in transfer despite the availability of the specialized services and the capacity to treat the patient. 

Findings include:

Review of the transferring hospital's medical record for Patient #1 revealed the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] with complaints of abdominal pain. The patient was found to be in labor with no previous prenatal care. Due to the lack of obstetrical services at the transferring hospital, the plan was to transfer the patient to a hospital with obstetrical services. 

Review of the transferring hospital's Emergency Department (ED) Physician Record dated 4/24/12 revealed that following a discussion of the case with the receiving facility perinatologist, it was decided that the patient was not a high risk patient and as such should be admitted     directly to the OB service and that the OB service on-call physician would be contacted. At 10:55pm the transferring hospital received a follow-up call from the intended recipient hospital indicating the transfer would not be accepted and that another hospital should be contacted for transfer. 

Interview with Staff #6 on 6/5/12 revealed a call was received from the transferring hospital ED physician requesting transfer of the patient. Gestational age was estimated to be 35-36 weeks based on measurements taken by the transferring hospital ED physician. Staff #6 informed the ED physician that based on the available information, the patient was not a high risk patient and as such could be admitted     directly to the OB service. Staff #6 informed Staff #5, the on-call OB service physician, who disagreed regarding the patient's risk status due to the lack of ultrasound dating and prenatal care. Staff #6 contacted the transferring hospital and suggested they contact another hospital for transfer. 

Interview with Staff #5 on 6/4/12 revealed he believed the perinatology service should have accepted the patient due to the patient's lack of prenatal care and questionable dating. 

Review of the Labor and Delivery Suite Patient Classification and Report Sheet dated 4/24/12 revealed when the initial request for transfer was recieved, patient census was 4. 

Interview with Staff # 3 on 6/5/12 revealed a capacity of 8 beds in the labor and delivery suite and 20 beds on the postpartum unit. The postpartum patient census on 4/24/12 was 18. 

Despite having the specialized services required and the capacity to treat the patient, transfer was refused due to a difference in opinion as to which OB service the patient should be admitted     to.

Based on medical record review, policy review, document review and interview, the hospital does not ensure that the risks of transfer specific to the patient's medical condition are documented, as evidenced for 9 of 20 emergency department (ED) patients who were transferred to another acute facility.  (Patients #2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 22 and 24)

Findings include: 

Medical record review on 9/30/13 revealed no evidence that the risks of transfer specific to the patient condition was listed and/or discussed with the patient for the following patients:
 - On 9/25/13, Patient #2 was being transferred due to hypotension and general weakness.
 - On 9/22/13, Patient #4 was being transferred due to acute appendicitis.
 - On 9/13/13, Patient #8 was being transferred due to an acute abdomen.
 - On 9/7/13, Patient #9 was being transferred due to cardiac arrest.
 - On 9/7/13, Patient #10 was being transferred due to a renal stone.
 - On 8/29/13, Patient #11 was being transferred due to esophageal food impaction.
 - On 9/1/13, Patient #15 was being transferred due to a pneumothorax.
 - On 8/7/13, Patient #22 was being transferred due to STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction).
 - On 6/5/13, Patient #24 was being transferred due to active labor. 

Review on 10/1/13 of policy ""EMTALA: Screening, Stabilization and Transfers"" (dated 12/18/12) revealed a physician must certify the medical benefits from transfer outweigh the risks and describe the reasons for and the potential risks and benefits by completing the applicable areas on the Patient Transfer Physician Certification form. 

Review on 10/1/13 of the Physician Certification of Transfer and Informed Consent to Transfer form revealed the following: 
 - Section IV - Risks vs. Benefits section includes an area for the physician to write at least one risk of transfer specific to the patient's current condition. 
 - Section VIII - Patient Consent to Transfer section has two options/check-off boxes for the patient to select: 
 1. to indicate whether they consent to transfer, have been informed of the risks of transfer versus the benefits, understand risks and consent to transfer. 
 2. patient refusal to transfer. 
There is another area (box) in this section for the patient/representative to sign. 

These findings were verified with Nurse Manager of Risk Management and Corporate Compliance Staff #1 and ED Medical Director Staff #12 on 10/1/13.

Based on policy review, medical record review and interview, there is lack of physician documentation related to ongoing medical examinations provided to Patient #24 in order to stabilize her emergency medical condition. 

Findings include: 

Review on 10/1/13 of policy ""EMTALA: Screening, Stabilization and Transfers"" (dated 12/18/12) revealed any woman in active labor is considered unstable for the purposes of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act). The physician must ensure that the evaluations/assessments included in the MSE (medical screening examination) are documented in the patient's medical record. In addition, the physician must determine and clearly document whether the patient has an EMC (emergency medical condition) in the patient's medical record. 

Review on 10/1/13 of the emergency department (ED) medical record dated 6/5/13 for Patient #24 revealed the following: 
 - ED Physician record indicates Patient #24 was seen on arrival at 4:30 AM by ED Physician Staff #8 for labor pains. She was full term and scheduled for a C-Section on 6/20/13. She had a history of seizure and was on Lamictal. Blood pressure was 130/92, pulse 88, temperature 98 and pulse oximetry 99%. FHS (fetal heart sounds) were 140. A pelvic exam showed water discharge, dilation and at full term. At 4:30 AM, Patient #24's OB (obstetric) physician was contacted, who gave instructions to send Patient #24 to another specified hospital with obstetrics service. At 4:45 AM, the OB physician at the other facility was contacted, but he could not come. Facility Medical Director Staff #16 was called and is on his way. 
 - The Physician Certification of Transfer and Informed Consent to Transfer form documented that an MSE was performed, the EMC was stabilized and a higher level of care was required for active labor, but it did not indicate risks specific to Patient #24's medical condition. Patient #1 was transfered by ambulance at 6:35 AM. See Tag #A-2409.
 - No further documentation of ongoing medical examinations and/or treatment by either Staff #8 or 16 was found in the medical record. 

During telephone interview on 10/3/13 at 10:45 AM, Staff #16 indicated he should have done a medical record entry on Patient #24 and there could have been more documentation by Staff #8.

.
Based on document review, video review, interview and in one (1) of four (4) Medical Records reviewed, the facility failed to provide an appropriate Medical Screening Examination (MSE) to determine if an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) existed.

This lack of an MSE may have placed patients at an increased safety risk.

Findings include:

The facility's security video of the emergency room    (ER), dated 09/06/18, from 6:40PM to 7:25PM identified the following:

*6:40:35PM - Patient #1 entered the Registration Room from the Waiting Room, passed two (2) Security Guards, and bypassed the Triage Room.

*6:41:13PM - Patient #1 exited the Registration Room, entered the ER, and walked towards the Staff Lounge. Patient remained in the Staff Lounge for approximately forty (40) minutes.

*7:20:05PM - Patient #1 then exited the Staff Lounge with Staff H (Access Service Representative {ASR}) and walked to the Nurses' Station.

Staff F was approached by a Registrar/Secretary and asked if she would perform an ultrasound on a patient. Staff F stated she knew Patient #1, since Patient #1 is an employee. She asked Patient #1 what was wrong. Patient #1 complained she was having belly pain and asked if Staff F would perform an ultrasound ""off the record"". Staff F stated she encouraged Patient #1 to ""get registered"" and to be evaluated by a Doctor. Staff F then answered a phone call and did not realize Patient #1 had left. When asked why she didn't document this conversation in the Medical Record, Staff F stated, ""she wasn't my patient, so there's no reason why I would have documented on her"".

Staff G suggested the patient speak to the Doctor to determine what would be the best route for the patient.

Staff G stated, ""I know [Patient #1] is pregnant, but I never spoke to the patient. I didn't get any paperwork on the patient ... the patient went directly to the Secretary, and never came to Triage ... They [patient and co-worker] spoke to the Doctor and she [Patient #1] left."" When asked why she didn't engage the patient, Staff G replied, ""The patient was already talking to the Doctor"".

Per interview of Staff I (RN) on 09/25/18 between 2:00PM and 3:00PM, Staff I stated that on 09/06/18, ""When I walked over to the Nursing Station to tell [Staff F] something, I overheard the conversation and Staff F encouraged the patient to stay and be seen ... the Secretaries were trying to talk her out of driving herself to LIJ (Long Island Jewish). I asked her why doesn't she stay? The patient refused and stated that she wanted to go to LIJ or Manhasset.""

Staff G stated, ""I don't know what we will be able to do for her here. Maybe you should speak to one of the Doctors."" Then I went to speak to Staff F. I explained the situation to Staff F and she then called the patient over to speak to her. I left her (Patient #1) at the Nursing Station while I was having the conversation with the Triage Nurse. I didn't hear the conversation between the patient and the Doctor. She (Patient #1) was crying. I was trying to stop her and tell her it was not good for her to drive in that condition.""

The facility could not provide documented evidence that Patient #1 had received a Medical Screening Examination or refused a Medical Screening Examination when offered.

Based on review of surveillance video, medical record review, document review, and staff interview, in one (1) of 40 medical records reviewed, it was determined the facility failed to ensure that the names of every individual who presented to the facility seeking emergency care was entered into the central log or the obstetric log. (Patient #1). 

Findings include:

Review of video surveillance camera revealed that on July 31, 2016 at 10:36 PM, Patient #1 entered the main lobby of the hospital with a companion and they approached a security guard who was sitting at the front desk. She was given a pink paper, which is the facility's protocol for patients who have been referred to the Labor and Delivery Unit (L&D) on the 6th Floor and they proceeded to the 6th Floor.
 Another video surveillance camera revealed the patient arriving at the nurses station in the L&D unit at 10:40:34 PM and she remained standing at the station for approximately 1 minute. The patient and her companion are then seen leaving the nurses station and the unit at 10:41:26 PM that night. A nurse is seen in view of the camera as the patient leaves the unit.

During an interview conducted on 08/12/16 at 10:30 AM Staff B, the Nurse Manager of the L&D Unit, confirmed that there was an interaction between the patient and Staff C, who is a registered nurse. Staff B also stated that Staff C performed a verbal assessment of the patient and instructed the patient to go to another facility.

A review of the ED central log and the obstetric log revealed there was no documented evidence that the patient's name was documented in either logs on July 31, 2016, when she went to the L&D unit seeking emergency medical care.

The policy titled  ""ED Daily Log Reconciliation Process""  which was last reviewed 07/11/2016 states,  ""all patients presenting to the hospital seeking treatment for an emergency medical condition are to be recorded on the Central ED Log.""

Complainant Subject (Patient #3):

Closed medical record review conducted on 10/13/2020 revealed Patient #3 was a [AGE]-year-old female who presented to Hospital A on 06/07/2020 at 1416 by private vehicle complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting. Patient #3 was triaged as a Level 3 (Levels are assigned when the patients present to the DED, with Level 1 being the most emergent and Level 5 being the least emergent); and her vital signs at 1521 were: blood pressure (BP) 133/88, pulse (P) 97, respirations (R) 17, pulse oximetry (SPO2) 99 % on room air, and temperature (T) 98.7 F, taken orally. At 1602 Patient #3 reported pain rated at 4 of 10. An MSE was initiated by Nurse Practitioner (NP) #1 at 1524. Review of a Provider Note written by NP #1 on 06/08/2020 at 0054 revealed, ""...[AGE]-year-old female patient presenting to the emergency department 3 days of nausea and vomiting. Patient denies any diarrhea, fever, or chills. She does report generalized abdominal pain with increased pain to the epigastric area. She states that she threw up bright red blood just prior to arrival. She states it was about one half of a cup. She denies ever having vomited blood in the past.

While waiting to see gastroenterology if your symptoms become worse or you start persistently vomiting blood or you vomit a large amount of blood please return to the emergency department and we will reevaluate you at that time. Take the pain and nausea medicine as prescribed. Follow-up with your primary care provider in the next 3 to 5 days. Call tomorrow to schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist. Prescriptions:  Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen (a pain medication) ... Ondansetron (Zofran - a medication for nausea)..."" Medications administered to Patient #3 during the DED visit included Morphine (a pain medication), Zofran, and Pantoprazole (a medication that reduces the acid secreted in the stomach).

Patient #3 was discharged    from the DED on 06/07/2020 at 2137. Review revealed a co-signature on Patient #3's chart by MD (Medical Doctor) #1 on 06/09/2020 at 0324, which read, ""I was personally available for consultation in the Emergency Department and serving as supervising physician for the MLP (Mid-Level Provider)."" The facility failed to ensure that their own Policy and Procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to provide further medical examination  and treatment prior to discharge for patient #3 on  6/7/2020, who had abnormal labs, Metabolic Acidosis, and an elevated anion gap. As  the patient required admission for treatment for abnormal labs, and was not stable for discharge.

Patient #3 presented to Hospital B's DED on 06/10/2020 and was subsequently admitted     to Hospital B for DKA. Patient #3 was discharged    from Hospital B on 06/12/2020 after stabilizing treatment was rendered.

Telephone interview was conducted with NP #1 on 10/13/2020 at 1340. Interview revealed NP #1 recalled Patient #3 as her Medical Director brought Patient #3 to NP #1's attention approximately 2 weeks after care was provided. Interview revealed NP #1 did not see Patient #3's laboratory studies prior to discharge. NP #1 recalled having 3 female patients with abdominal pain at the same time, in rooms next to each other. Interview revealed Patient #3 was in room 34, and a nurse reported that ""34 felt better and wanted to go home."" NP #1 advised she said, ""OK I'll write her up for discharge."" Interview revealed, ""I must have looked at one of the other patient's labs. That was a mistake on my part."" Interview revealed upon review of Patient #3's laboratory values she ""absolutely had new onset diabetes and was in DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis - when the blood sugar is too high, and the blood begins to become acidic). She (Patient #3) should have been admitted     to the hospital."" Interview revealed NP #1's medical director recommended always re-checking laboratory and any imaging orders prior to any patient's discharge to avoid future confusion. 

Telephone interview was conducted on 10/13/2020 at 1517 with the Dedicated Emergency Department Medical Director (DED MD). Interview revealed he was aware of Patient #3's case. Interview revealed it appeared NP #1 was confused on the patient's lab values. Interview revealed midlevel practitioners were not expected to consult with their oversight physicians on every patient they see, for example the level 4 and 5 patients. Some Level 3 patients may require oversight physician consult, depending upon the comfort level of the midlevel practitioner when providing care. Any care provided by a midlevel practitioner to a Level 1 or 2 patient would require oversight provider consult. Interview revealed if NP #1 had looked at Patient #3's lab values correctly she would have been expected to communicate with her oversight provider. 

Telephone interview was conducted on 10/14/2020 at 1000 with MD #1. Interview revealed MD #1 did not recall Patient #3. MD #1 had reviewed Patient #3's case with the DED MD. Interview revealed if Mid-Level Providers had concerns with any patients it was customary for them to bring those concerns to the oversight physician, but that did not occur in this case. Interview revealed MD #1 felt confident that if NP #1 had reviewed Patient #3's labs correctly, ""she would have brought them to my attention.""

	a. Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy;
	b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
	c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or parts ...""

A complete and appropriate MSE will be performed on all individuals who come to the hospital requesting examination or treatment or attempts will be made to advise the patient of the risk of leaving before an MSE can be completed. An MSE will be completed regardless of an individual's ability to pay.""

* ""Qualified medical personnel who may be permitted to perform a MSE are defined as: Members with clinical privileges; and Registered Nurses ...""

* ""If a patient presenting to ED(s) or L&D/Perinatal department(s) and while waiting for medical screening decides to leave without examination (AMA/LWBS) the following steps should be taken if at all possible:
	a. Explain to the patient it is important to have the medical screening to rule out whether or not they have a medical condition that needs treatment;
	b. Use an interpreter if the patient has limited English proficiency, or use an alternate means of communication;
	c. Inform the patient of the risks of not having the medical screening;
	d. Ask the patient to sign the AMA form acknowledging they understand the risks of leaving without the medical screening;
	e. Document on the medical record the above information and if they refuse to sign the AMA, document that on the record as well.""

Based on interview, review of documentation in 1 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from PPMC to another hospital for specialty services not available at PPMC at that time (Patient 22), and review of hospital policies and procedures and other documents, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved: 
* Physician certification of medical benefits vs risks was not documented.
* There was no documentation that available medical records were sent or transmitted to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The policy and procedure ""Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities"" dated as last reviewed ""03/2018"" included the following definitions and ""Procedures:""
* ""For the purpose of this policy, an EMTALA patient is defined as any patient present in a facility's emergency department who has been stabilized within the limits of that facility's current capabilities or a patient present in a facility's emergency department who has not been stabilized and the patient is requesting the transfer, after being informed of the hospital's EMTALA obligations and the risks of transfer. The sending hospital takes precedence in determining if the patient is an EMTALA patient. Transfers of these patients are subject to EMTALA provisions.""
* ""Prior to transfer, an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient. Individualized risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and documented on the Patient Transfer Form or physician documentation in the medical record.""
* ""Stabilized patients may be transferred to another facility...if physician or qualified care provider certifies in writing that the benefits of transferring the patient to another facility outweigh the risk (See Attachment A - 'Patient Transfer Form.')."" 
* ""Accompanying records sent with patient...[ED] treatment record...Flow sheet(s)...Laboratory results...X-rays...Progress notes...""
* ""Documentation to occur on patient's chart...Records that accompanied patient...Explanation of benefits and risks are explained to patient/family.""

2. The ED record of Patient 22 was reviewed and reflected that the pregnant patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1111 following a MVA. The ""Obstetric Admission Note"" dated 06/21/2018 at 1632 by the CNM reflected that the patient received a MSE and ""Irregular uterine contractions...Plan transfer to LEMC for observation due to PTL symptoms/ ? Abruption at 34w4d and PPMC NICU on divert (pt elects transfer to avoid postpartum neonatal transfer if [he/she] delivers). [Discussed with LEMC Physician], who accepts pt transfer and agrees w/ plan of care. LEMC L&D notified...[Physician] recommended transfer and counseling upon arrival due to gestation [greater than] 34wk and dilation 3cm."" 

The ""Patient Transfer"" form dated and timed next to the physician's signature as 06/21/2018 at 1605 lacked individualized information about the reason for, and risks and benefits of transfer. The only documentation was in the form of a checkmark in a box next to ""Reason for Transfer:...Medically indicated"" and another checkmark in a box next to ""Summary of transfer benefits:...Obtain level of care/service not available at the facility."" Under the section for ""Summary of transfer risks"" there was no documentation. As required by this CFR and the PPMC policy referenced above there was no clear documentation of  ""...an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient. Individualized risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and documented on the Patient Transfer Form or physician documentation in the medical record.""

This deficiency potentially affects all patients transferred from another facility without transfer documents for medical treatment.

Findings include:

Per review of Patient #1's obstetric triage and labor documentation, Patient #1 arrived at the facility on 2/19/17 at 12:31 AM, in labor accompanied by a midwife who believed the patient may have a breech presentation and needed a cesarean section.  Per the Delivery Record, at 2:02 AM Patient #1 delivered an infant vaginally.  The infant was not in breech position.  The patient was  triaged at 12:31 AM, delivered vaginally and discharged    at 4:10 AM.  This was confirmed in interview during record review with Quality Compliance Coordinator E on 2/27/17 at 9:30 AM.

Per interview with Registered Nurse Legal Counsel B on 2/28/17 at 9:01 AM, s/he was made aware of Patient #1 arriving at the facility from another Eau Claire hospital on [DATE], and contacted the other hospital to confirm.   Nurse B said after discussion with the other legal counsel they decided to report the inappropriate transfer, due to Patient #1 not having a Medical Screening Exam, proper transfer forms completed or physician to physician contact for acceptance.

Per interview on 2/28/17 at 9:25 AM with Privacy Officer C, s/he provided a copy of an email she sent to a State Agency contact, on 2/22/17 at 2:46 PM, reporting the inappropriate transfer, and requested a ""read receipt:""   Officer C said s/he received a relayed receipt from Mail Delivery System <MAILER-DAEMON@zixvpm01.shec.hshs.org> on 2/22/17 at 3:08 PM, that stated ""Delivery to these recipients or groups is complete, but no delivery notification was sent by the destination server...""  Officer C said s/he believed the email was received because the MAILER-DAEMON message said it was complete.  Per Officer C, s/he never received a read receipt.  Officer C was unaware that notifications from MAILER-DAEMON usually means it was not delivered.

Review of the email sent on 2/22/17 by Privacy Officer C had an obsolete email address for the State Agency contact.

Per email confirmation on 2/28/17 at 9:41 AM the intended recipient at the State Agency confirmed the email was not received.

The patient told (RN C) her water broke and (RN C) asked if she needed to push.""  Registrar D had finished with the other patient at that time and asked RN C to take the other patient up to Obstetrics.
