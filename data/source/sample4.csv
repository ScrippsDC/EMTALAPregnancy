Based on a review of facility documentation and staff interviews, the facility failed to ensure each patient presenting at the hospital emergency department received an appropriate and complete medical screening examination according to hospital policy and current standards of care for 1 of 20 emergency department patients [Patient #1].

Findings were:

Facility policy entitled ""ED-020 Gravid Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department,"" effective date 2/11/19, included the following:
""SCOPE
Applies to Women's Services Department (OB) and Emergency Department (ED) at Seton Medical Center Harker Heights.

A review of the emergency department record of Patient #1 revealed she presented at the Seton Medical Center Harker Heights emergency department on 1/18/20 due to a motor vehicle accident.  A local fire department responded to the accident, and the fire department patient care record included documentation of a full patient assessment with no abnormal findings with the exception of an entry entitled ""General,"" which included the following:  
""Pt is 30wks pregnant and would like to be seen for an ultra sound ...""
Additional documentation on the form included:
""Primary Impression:  No complaints or Injury/Illness Noted...
Chief Complaint:  I just want to be checked out ...""

Vital signs at 10:15 p.m. were as follows:
Blood pressure 165/91 (slightly elevated), Pulse 140 (rapid), 17 breaths/min (normal), oxygenation on room air 99%, no temperature noted.

Vital signs at 10:30 p.m. were as follows:
Blood pressure 160/90 (slightly elevated), Pulse 125 (rapid), 17 breaths/min, oxygenation on room air 98%, temperature 98.2

A fire department note read as follows:
""...dispatched to two vehicle accident on [intersection of two streets] ... one vehicle with minor damage to front passenger side bumper under the bridge facing southbound ...  the driver of this vehicle is a 21 yof (year-old female) with no chief complaints was just wanting to have Vitals checked.

Pt states that she is fine and wanted some help to gather her belongings from the wrecked car and EMS did so ... After a few moments of staying onscene the 21 YOF walks up and states that she would like to be transported to the ER  for further evaluation.  EMS questions the Pt again and ask what is hurting or what is wrong?  The Pt states she feels fine but her husband wants her to go to the ER  for an ultrasound.  EMS walk the Pt to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) and transport begins routine traffic to Seton ER.  Pt report is given via Radio.  Upon arrival to Seton ER  Pt is taken by ER  staff to L&D (labor and delivery) and Pt report is given to escort for L&D ...""

The fire department documentation indicated arrival at Seton Harker Heights at 10:32 p.m. on 1/18/20.  A section entitled ""Patient Transport Details"" included the following:
""How was Patient Moved to Ambulance:  Assisted/Walk
Patient Position During Transport:  Sitting

Patient #1 appeared on a ""Women's Services Triage Log"" for that date at 10:40 p.m.  Her chief complaint was listed as ""MVA (motor vehicle accident)"" with an entry under the ""Services"" column as, ""Vitals, NST (non stress test), monitor for 1 hr.""  

A non stress test (NST) is a way to check fetal health.  It records fetal movement, heartbeat and contractions in the 3rd trimester to check that the fetus is getting enough oxygen.  The following is included as reference from Medline:
(available at:   https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/ 5.htm) 
""Non-stress Test (NST)
A healthy baby's heart rate will rise from time to time. During the non-stress test (NST), your provider will watch to see if the baby's heart rate goes faster while resting or moving. You will receive no medicines for this test.
If the baby's heart rate does not go up on its own, you may be asked to rub your hand over your belly. This may wake up a sleepy baby. A device may also be used to send a noise into your belly. It will not cause any pain.
You will be hooked up to a fetal monitor, which is a heart monitor for your baby. If the baby's heart rate goes up from time to time, the test results will most likely be normal. NST results that are reactive mean that the baby's heart rate went up normally.
Non-reactive results mean that the baby's heart rate did not go up enough. If the heart rate does not go up enough, you may need more tests.
Another term you might hear for this test result is a categorization of 1, 2, or 3.
 * Category 1 means the result is normal ...""

In an interview with Staff #12, Director of Emergency Services, on the morning of 10/26/20 at approximately 9:50 a.m. in the hospital conference room, she stated, ""This person would have been in a wheelchair and taken down to L&D ...  She wouldn't be on the ED log because she was being seen in L&D.  We wouldn't write her down on the ED log if that's the case.""  When asked if L&D kept a separate log of patients presenting there, she said she believed they did.  In a subsequent interview with Staff #12 on the morning of 10/27/20 at approximately 10:15 a.m., she stated, "" ...This patient probably should have been seen in the ED because of the MVA ...""

In a telephone interview with a relative of the patient on the evening of 10/26/20 at 8:01 p.m., he stated, ""There were a couple of reasons for this complaint.  First, no medical screening examination was done...  And second, she was never seen by an MD, DO or NP (nurse practitioner).  She arrived after an air bag had been deployed.  It was determined she needed to go to the hospital by EMS.  When she arrived at the ER, the nurse in the ER  didn't even examine her.  She didn't even get her blood pressure.  The nurse had her get off the gurney without her even being examined.  She walked herself over to the ER  and to L&D without even knowing if it was safe for her to walk.  They denied the ultrasound.  It was never done.  She asked that someone call her physician.  That was denied.  They said it wasn't a physician in Killeen who worked there ...""

Based on document review and staff interviews, the hospital's administrative staff failed to ensure the hospital's emergency department staff provided an adequate medical screening examination to 1 of 17 reviewed emergency department patients (Patient #1) and 1 of 3 reviewed obstetrical department patients (Patient #2). Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #1, who then required emergency medical care at a hospital approximately 25 miles away for treatment of a life-threatening infection. Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #2 without screening Patient #2 to determine if Patient #2 had a non-obstetrical emergency medical condition. The hospital's administrative staff identified an average of approximately 1,800 patients per month who presented to the emergency department and requested a medical screening examination.

Findings include:

1. Record review of Patient #1 revealed the following:

a. On 11/7/21 at approximately 12:56 AM, the Long-Term Care (LTC) staff at Patient #1's LTC facility summoned Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff to transport Patient #1 to Trinity Regional Medical Center, due to Patient #1's complaints of pain. Shortly prior to the EMS staff arriving in Patient #1's room, the LTC staff administered 6 milligrams (mg) of Dilaudid (hydromorphone, a potent opiate pain medication used to treat severe pain). 

b. Patient #1 presented to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center on 11/7/21 at approximately 1:20 AM. Registered Nurse (RN) H documented Patient #1's chief complaint was ""... pain in whole body...""

c. At 1:45 AM, RN H documetented Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 ""Worst Possible Pain)."" 

d. At 1:52 AM, ED Physician I documented Patient #1's skin was ""negative for color change and rash."" ED Physician I's physical exam of Patient #1's skin revealed ""General: Skin is warm and dry. Capillary Refill: Capillary refill takes less than 2 seconds."" (Capillary refill provides an indication if a patient has adequate blood flow to a part of the body) ED Physician I then documented ""Patient has chronic pain issues. [Patient #1] was sent here for [Patient #1's] pain. Prior to arrival [at the hospital, Patient #1] had gotten 6 mg of Dilaudid and a 0.5 mg Ativan (a medication to relieve anxiety). ... [Patient #1] continued to complain of pain.... Unfortunately with [Patient #1], I do not feel there is ever a way that [Patient #1] is going to be out of pain. I think [Patient #1's] expectations of pain control are way out of proportion.""

e. At 06:36 AM, RN C documented they discharged    Patient #1 back to Patient #1's LTC facility.

Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence the hospital ED staff reassessed Patient #1's pain following the administration of the Skelaxin (a potent muscle relaxing medication) or at any point prior to Patient #1's discharge from the ED, despite Patient #1 initially rating their pain at 10 out of 10 (the worst possible pain). Additionally, Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence that the ED staff examined Patient #1 sufficiently to identify the presence of the pressure wound located on Patient #1's mid-back, despite Patient #1's ED medical record containing ""Surgical wound, non healing"" as a medical problem for Patient #1 and ""Wound Dressing (Foam Dressing Bordered) PADS, Apply 1 application topically every thrid day as needed"" listed in Patient #1's home medication list.



f. Patient #1 presented again to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center (TRMC) on 11/11/21 at 9:54 PM by ambulance with chief complaint of weakness and recent change of condition noted at by family when at the long-term care facility. Patient #1 tested   positive for COVID-19 prior to ED visit on 11/11/21.

At 9:56 PM, RN C checked Patient #1's vitals, which showed Patient #1's blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg (millimeters of mercury, normal range 120/80 mmHg) and Patient #1's temperature was low at 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit (normal is 98.6 degrees). Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 on a 1-10 pain scale (where 1 is almost no pain and 10 is the worst pain ever). RN C documented Patient #1 was alert and oriented to person, place, and events.

h. At 10:19 PM, Physician E documented Patient #1 was ""Not in acute distress, normal appearance, she is not toxic-appearing"" (not ill appearing)  ... ""alert and orientated to person, place, and time""  ... ""Behavior normal"". Physician E ordered the hospital staff perform a chest x-ray on Patient #1 and perform basic laboratory blood tests to check if Patient #1 had an infection and Patient #1's overall health. The nursing staff administered intravenous (IV) fluids due to Patient #1's dehydration.

i. At 10:37 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 had a ""marked difference in speech when patient's daughter arrived"" to ED. ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan (a medication to reverse the sedation effects from pain medications), in case Patient #1's changed speech pattern was due to Patient #1 receiving pain medication. (Patient #1 did not receive pain medication in the hospital's emergency department) 

j. At 10:19 PM, ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan to Patient #1, as Patient #1 continued to exhibit a changed speech pattern, and the prior administration of Narcan had not resolved Patient #1's changed speech pattern.

k. At 10:46 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 87/58 mmHg (low blood pressure can indicate the patient has a life threatening systemic infection called sepsis).

l. At 11:01 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 81/58 mmHg.

m. At 11:16 PM, laboratory test results indicated Patient #1 had an elevated White Blood Cell count of 14.66 (indicating Patient #1 had a possible infection) and Patient #1 had a low potassium level of 2.8 mEq/mL (low potassium can potentially cause a life-threatening condition where the heart doesn't beat correctly). Additional laboratory test results indicated Patient #1 was malnourished (which increased Patient #1's risk of developing pressure wounds).

n. At 11:23 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 95/69 mmHg. Patient #1's blood pressure increased in response to the IV fluids and Narcan administration.

o. At 11:23 PM, ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan to Patient #1, as Patient #1 continued to exhibit a changed speech pattern, and the prior administrations of Narcan had not resolved Patient #1's changed speech pattern.

p. At 11:30 PM, RN C verbally notified ED Physician E that Patient #1 had a critically low potassium level. 

q. At 11:44 PM, ED Physician E instructed RN C to give Patient #1 oral potassium to increase Patient #1's potassium level.

r. At 12:26 AM, ED Physician E documented ""Patient stable in ER. Patient without respiratory distress. Patient is released to home. Patient given potassium  ... supplementation. Patient to cut back on Dilaudid."" ""Please stop Dilaudid, God bless you.""

s. At 1:23 AM, the hospital staff discharged    Patient #1 using a wheelchair. The hospital staff assisted Patient #1 into Patient #1's daughter's car.




2. During an interview on 3/2/22 at 9:00 AM, RN C revealed that when Patient #1 presented to the hospital's ED on 11/7/22, RN C felt like Patient #1 was acting as if the ED staff did not want to treat Patient #1 and then Patient #1 acted as if nothing was wrong with Patient #1.

RN C then indicated that when Patient #1 arrived to the hospital's Emergency Department on 11/11/21, Patient #1 was alert and oriented. Prior to Patient #1's arrival at the Emergency Department, a nurse from Patient #1's long-term care facility called RN C and informed RN C that Patient #1 had experienced a change in Patient #1's condition that day. However, the long-term care nurse indicated they believed that the change in Patient #1's condition was not due to a medical condition, but was instead due to Patient #1's own behavior.

RN C had previously taken care of Patient #1 in the emergency department 4 days prior (the 11/7/21 ED visit). RN C remembered that Patient #1 previously could stand and pivot to transfer into a bed or chair, but during the ED visit on 11/11/22, Patient #1 could no longer stand and pivot to transfer themself. When Patient #1's daughter arrived in the ED, Patient #1 became sleepier and stopped talking to the ED staff. ED Physician E thought Patient #1 had received too much pain medication, so ED Physician E ordered RN C to administer Narcan twice to Patient #1. RN C felt that Patient #1's increased sleepiness and not talking was due to a behavioral issue with Patient #1, and not an underlying medical problem.


3. During an interview on 3/2/22 at 12:20 PM, ED Physician E revealed they did not recall providing care to Patient #1. However, ED Physician E indicated that when they evaluated a patient to determine if the patient had sepsis (a life-threatening systemic infection), ED Physician E would perform laboratory testing, obtain blood cultures (to check the patient's blood for an infection), obtain urine cultures (to check the patient's urine for an infection), examine the patient, and determine if Patient #1 had exposure to potential infections. 

If a patient resided in a long-term care facility, ED Physician E indicated they were more likely to discharge a patient instead of admitting the patient to the hospital, as the patient had access to nursing care at their long-term care facility.


4. Review of Patient #1's medical record from Hospital #2 (located approximately 25 miles away) revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] after the ED staff discharged    Patient #1 from TRMC's emergency department. Upon arrival at Hospital #2's Emergency Department, the ED staff noted Patient #1 was lethargic, confused, and had an infected Stage IV pressure wound (a wound where the patient had lost all of the muscle and tissue in an area, resulting in exposure of the patient's bone).




5. Review of medical records revealed Patient #2, who was 29 weeks pregnant and had a history of anemia and asthma, arrived at the Trinity Regional Medical Center (TRMC) on 1/6/2022 at 7:10 PM. Registered Nurse (RN) B documented Patient #2 presented for complaints of cough, fever, leg cramps with high heart rate. RN B noted Patent #2 had a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, with heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and rated their pain at 4 (Moderate) on a scale of 1-10 (1 being almost no pain and 10 being the worst pain possible).

At 7:52 PM (42 minutes after Patient #2 arrived in the OB Department), RN B received orders from Obstetrician G over the phone to perform fetal heart tone monitoring (where the nursing staff monitored Patent #2's baby's heart rate and sounds), administer Tylenol to Patient #2, and screen Patient #2 for COVID-19. Patient #2's medical record lacked evidence of any further laboratory testing ordered by Obstetrician G, such as testing to determine the cause of Patient #2's fever.

At 8:29 PM, RN B charted ""... Provided an emergency medical screening examination ..."".

At 8:29PM, RN B updated Obstetrician G about Patient #2's condition and RN B received orders to discharge Patient #2 from the hospital.

At 11:07 PM (almost 3.5 hours after Obstetrician G discharged    Patient #2 from the hospital), the hospital laboratory staff completed the laboratory testing on Patient #2, which indicated Patient #2 had COVID-19.

Patient #2's medical record lacked evidence that Patient #2 received a medical screening examination to determine the cause of Patient #2's fever, besides the testing for COVID-19. The medical record only contained evidence of the obstetrical medical screening examination.

6. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 3:33 PM, RN A recalled RN A too Patient #2 back to an obstetrical exam room in the obstetrical department, as Patient #2 arrived right at the time the nursing staff changed their shift. RN A did not provide any further care for Patient #2.

Normally, when a patient who is more than 20 weeks pregnant presents to the hospital's ED, the ED staff call the obstetrical unit to request the obstetrical nursing staff assess the patient. The obstetrical staff would request the ED staff to perform a medical screening examination to determine if the patient had an non-obstetrical emergency medical condition prior to sending the patient to the obstetrical unit. However, the obstetrical staff did not check to verify the emergency department staff had performed a medical screening examination on the patient prior to transferring the patient to the obstetrical unit.

When a pregnant patient arrived on the obstetrical unit, regardless of their chief complaint, the obstetrical nursing staff evaluated the patient and performed an obstetrical medical screening examination. The obstetrical nursing staff would contact the on-call obstetrician and inform the obstetrician of their obstetrical exam findings. The obstetrician would provide verbal orders to the obstetrical nurse for any further testing on the patient, but would not normally come to the hospital to assess the patient, unless the patient was actively in labor.


7. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 4:15 PM, RN B acknowledged they were Patient #2's primary nurse when Patient #2 presented to the hospital's obstetrical department. However, RN B could not remember any of the care RN B provided to Patient #2. However, RN B indicated that when a patient who is more than 20 weeks pregnant presented to the hospital, the Emergency Department staff sent the patient to the obstetrical unit, regardless of the patient's chief complaint. When the patient arrived on the obstetrical unit, the obstetrical nurses would assess and triage the patient. The obstetrical nurses provided an obstetrical medical screening examination, contacted the on-call obstetrician, and then received any necessary orders from the on-call obstetrician. The obstetrician would not normally come into the hospital to assess the patient, unless the patient was in labor. After the nursing staff contacted the on-call obstetrician, the nursing staff would complete the paperwork for the patient, and the on-call obstetrician would sign the paperwork the following day, including the documentation of the obstetrical medical screening examination.



8. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 4:30 PM, Obstetrician G revealed that the Emergency Department staff sent all patients who are more than 20 weeks pregnant to the Obstetrical department, regardless if the patient's chief complaint involved an obstetrical problem. The obstetrical nursing staff would perform an obstetrical exam on the patients and then call Obstetrician G. Obstetrician G would talk with the obstetrical nurse and Obstetrician G would provide orders to the nurse for the patient. Obstetrician G indicated that the ED staff expected the obstetrical staff to perform both the medical screening examination for both the obstetrical concerns and the patient's other emergency medical concerns. Obstetrician G did not feel qualified to address a patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, but the ED staff did not want the obstetrical staff to transfer a pregnant patient back to the ED for management of the patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, especially if the ED was busy at the time.  Thus, even though Obstetrician G indicated they lacked knowledge to treat non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, Obstetrician G had to treat the patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions.

Obstetrician G indicated that if a pregnant patient presented with a fever to the obstetrical department, such as Patient #2, Obstetrician G would order the nursing staff to perform an obstetrical screening examination, laboratory testing such as checking the patient's blood or urine for signs of infection, and all patients received routine screening for COVID-19 infection. Depending on the patient's symptoms and lab test results, Obstetrician G would order the nursing staff to either admit the patient overnight to the hospital for further monitoring or discharge the patient home. Obstetrician G normally relied on the obstetrical nursing staff to perform the obstetrical medical screening examination and would only go into the hospital to examine the patient if the patient was in active labor.

Based on document review and staff interviews, the hospital's administrative staff failed to ensure the hospital's emergency department staff provided an adequate medical screening examination to 1 of 17 reviewed emergency department patients (Patient #1) and 1 of 3 reviewed obstetrical department patients (Patient #2). Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #1, who then required emergency medical care at a hospital approximately 25 miles away for treatment of a life-threatening infection. Failure to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #2 without screening Patient #2 to determine if Patient #2 had a non-obstetrical emergency medical condition. The hospital's administrative staff identified an average of approximately 1,800 patients per month who presented to the emergency department and requested a medical screening examination.

Findings include:

1. Record review of Patient #1 revealed the following:

a. On 11/7/21 at approximately 12:56 AM, the Long-Term Care (LTC) staff at Patient #1's LTC facility summoned Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff to transport Patient #1 to Trinity Regional Medical Center, due to Patient #1's complaints of pain. Shortly prior to the EMS staff arriving in Patient #1's room, the LTC staff administered 6 milligrams (mg) of Dilaudid (hydromorphone, a potent opiate pain medication used to treat severe pain). 

b. Patient #1 presented to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center on 11/7/21 at approximately 1:20 AM. Registered Nurse (RN) H documented Patient #1's chief complaint was ""... pain in whole body...""

c. At 1:45 AM, RN H documetented Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 ""Worst Possible Pain)."" 

d. At 1:52 AM, ED Physician I documented Patient #1's skin was ""negative for color change and rash."" ED Physician I's physical exam of Patient #1's skin revealed ""General: Skin is warm and dry. Capillary Refill: Capillary refill takes less than 2 seconds."" (Capillary refill provides an indication if a patient has adequate blood flow to a part of the body) ED Physician I then documented ""Patient has chronic pain issues. [Patient #1] was sent here for [Patient #1's] pain. Prior to arrival [at the hospital, Patient #1] had gotten 6 mg of Dilaudid and a 0.5 mg Ativan (a medication to relieve anxiety). ... [Patient #1] continued to complain of pain.... Unfortunately with [Patient #1], I do not feel there is ever a way that [Patient #1] is going to be out of pain. I think [Patient #1's] expectations of pain control are way out of proportion.""

e. At 06:36 AM, RN C documented they discharged    Patient #1 back to Patient #1's LTC facility.

Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence the hospital ED staff reassessed Patient #1's pain following the administration of the Skelaxin (a potent muscle relaxing medication) or at any point prior to Patient #1's discharge from the ED, despite Patient #1 initially rating their pain at 10 out of 10 (the worst possible pain). Additionally, Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence that the ED staff examined Patient #1 sufficiently to identify the presence of the pressure wound located on Patient #1's mid-back, despite Patient #1's ED medical record containing ""Surgical wound, non healing"" as a medical problem for Patient #1 and ""Wound Dressing (Foam Dressing Bordered) PADS, Apply 1 application topically every thrid day as needed"" listed in Patient #1's home medication list.



f. Patient #1 presented again to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center (TRMC) on 11/11/21 at 9:54 PM by ambulance with chief complaint of weakness and recent change of condition noted at by family when at the long-term care facility. Patient #1 tested   positive for COVID-19 prior to ED visit on 11/11/21. 

g. At 9:56 PM, RN C checked Patient #1's vitals, which showed Patient #1's blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg (millimeters of mercury, normal range 120/80 mmHg) and Patient #1's temperature was low at 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit (normal is 98.6 degrees). Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 on a 1-10 pain scale (where 1 is almost no pain and 10 is the worst pain ever). RN C documented Patient #1 was alert and oriented to person, place, and events.

Findings include:


1. Review of the policy ""EMTALA: Transfer and Emergency Examination ED"", effective 1/2022, revealed in part, ""Each individual who seeks examination or treatment on Medical Center Premises shall be offered a medical screening examination to determine whether an emergency medical condition exsits ..."". The policy defined an emergency medical condition as ""A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical condition could reasonably be expected to result in: 1. Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant women, the health of the women or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, 2. Serious impairment of bodily functions, or 3. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part ...""

a. On 11/7/21 at approximately 12:56 AM, the Long-Term Care (LTC) staff at Patient #1's LTC facility summoned Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff to transport Patient #1 to Trinity Regional Medical Center, due to Patient #1's complaints of pain. Shortly prior to the EMS staff arriving in Patient #1's room, the LTC staff administered 6 milligrams (mg) of Dilaudid (hydromorphone, a potent opiate pain medication used to treat severe pain). 

b. Patient #1 presented to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center on 11/7/21 at approximately 1:20 AM. Registered Nurse (RN) H documented Patient #1's chief complaint was ""... pain in whole body...""

c. At 1:45 AM, RN H documetented Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 ""Worst Possible Pain)."" 

d. At 1:52 AM, ED Physician I documented Patient #1's skin was ""negative for color change and rash."" ED Physician I's physical exam of Patient #1's skin revealed ""General: Skin is warm and dry. Capillary Refill: Capillary refill takes less than 2 seconds."" (Capillary refill provides an indication if a patient has adequate blood flow to a part of the body) ED Physician I then documented ""Patient has chronic pain issues. [Patient #1] was sent here for [Patient #1's] pain. Prior to arrival [at the hospital, Patient #1] had gotten 6 mg of Dilaudid and a 0.5 mg Ativan (a medication to relieve anxiety). ... [Patient #1] continued to complain of pain.... Unfortunately with [Patient #1], I do not feel there is ever a way that [Patient #1] is going to be out of pain. I think [Patient #1's] expectations of pain control are way out of proportion.""

e. At 06:36 AM, RN C documented they discharged    Patient #1 back to Patient #1's LTC facility.

Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence the hospital ED staff reassessed Patient #1's pain following the administration of the Skelaxin (a potent muscle relaxing medication) or at any point prior to Patient #1's discharge from the ED, despite Patient #1 initially rating their pain at 10 out of 10 (the worst possible pain). Additionally, Patient #1's medical record lacked evidence that the ED staff examined Patient #1 sufficiently to identify the presence of the pressure wound located on Patient #1's mid-back, despite Patient #1's ED medical record containing ""Surgical wound, non healing"" as a medical problem for Patient #1 and ""Wound Dressing (Foam Dressing Bordered) PADS, Apply 1 application topically every thrid day as needed"" listed in Patient #1's home medication list.



f. Patient #1 presented again to the ED at Trinity Regional Medical Center (TRMC) on 11/11/21 at 9:54 PM by ambulance with chief complaint of weakness and recent change of condition noted at by family when at the long-term care facility. Patient #1 tested   positive for COVID-19 prior to ED visit on 11/11/21. 

g. At 9:56 PM, RN C checked Patient #1's vitals, which showed Patient #1's blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg (millimeters of mercury, normal range 120/80 mmHg) and Patient #1's temperature was low at 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit (normal is 98.6 degrees). Patient #1 rated their pain at 10 out of 10 on a 1-10 pain scale (where 1 is almost no pain and 10 is the worst pain ever). RN C documented Patient #1 was alert and oriented to person, place, and events.

h. At 10:19 PM, Physician E documented Patient #1 was ""Not in acute distress, normal appearance, she is not toxic-appearing"" (not ill appearing)  ... ""alert and orientated to person, place, and time""  ... ""Behavior normal"". Physician E ordered the hospital staff perform a chest x-ray on Patient #1 and perform basic laboratory blood tests to check if Patient #1 had an infection and Patient #1's overall health. The nursing staff administered intravenous (IV) fluids due to Patient #1's dehydration.

i. At 10:37 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 had a ""marked difference in speech when patient's daughter arrived"" to ED. ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan (a medication to reverse the sedation effects from pain medications), in case Patient #1's changed speech pattern was due to Patient #1 receiving pain medication. (Patient #1 did not receive pain medication in the hospital's emergency department) 

j. At 10:19 PM, ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan to Patient #1, as Patient #1 continued to exhibit a changed speech pattern, and the prior administration of Narcan had not resolved Patient #1's changed speech pattern.

k. At 10:46 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 87/58 mmHg (low blood pressure can indicate the patient has a life threatening systemic infection called sepsis).

l. At 11:01 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 81/58 mmHg.

m. At 11:16 PM, laboratory test results indicated Patient #1 had an elevated White Blood Cell count of 14.66 (indicating Patient #1 had a possible infection) and Patient #1 had a low potassium level of 2.8 mEq/mL (low potassium can potentially cause a life-threatening condition where the heart doesn't beat correctly). Additional laboratory test results indicated Patient #1 was malnourished (which increased Patient #1's risk of developing pressure wounds).

n. At 11:23 PM, RN C documented Patient #1 continued to experience low blood pressure with RN C documenting Patient #1's blood pressure as 95/69 mmHg. Patient #1's blood pressure increased in response to the IV fluids and Narcan administration.

o. At 11:23 PM, ED Physician E ordered the nursing staff to administer Narcan to Patient #1, as Patient #1 continued to exhibit a changed speech pattern, and the prior administrations of Narcan had not resolved Patient #1's changed speech pattern.

p. At 11:30 PM, RN C verbally notified ED Physician E that Patient #1 had a critically low potassium level. 

q. At 11:44 PM, ED Physician E instructed RN C to give Patient #1 oral potassium to increase Patient #1's potassium level.

r. At 12:26 AM, ED Physician E documented ""Patient stable in ER. Patient without respiratory distress. Patient is released to home. Patient given potassium  ... supplementation. Patient to cut back on Dilaudid."" ""Please stop Dilaudid, God bless you.""

s. At 1:23 AM, the hospital staff discharged    Patient #1 using a wheelchair. The hospital staff assisted Patient #1 into Patient #1's daughter's car.




3. During an interview on 3/2/22 at 9:00 AM, RN C revealed that when Patient #1 presented to the hospital's ED on 11/7/22, RN C felt like Patient #1 was acting as if the ED staff did not want to treat Patient #1 and then Patient #1 acted as if nothing was wrong with Patient #1.

RN C then indicated that when Patient #1 arrived to the hospital's Emergency Department on 11/11/21, Patient #1 was alert and oriented. Prior to Patient #1's arrival at the Emergency Department, a nurse from Patient #1's long-term care facility called RN C and informed RN C that Patient #1 had experienced a change in Patient #1's condition that day. However, the long-term care nurse indicated they believed that the change in Patient #1's condition was not due to a medical condition, but was instead due to Patient #1's own behavior.

RN C had previously taken care of Patient #1 in the emergency department 4 days prior (the 11/7/21 ED visit). RN C remembered that Patient #1 previously could stand and pivot to transfer into a bed or chair, but during the ED visit on 11/11/22, Patient #1 could no longer stand and pivot to transfer themself. When Patient #1's daughter arrived in the ED, Patient #1 became sleepier and stopped talking to the ED staff. ED Physician E thought Patient #1 had received too much pain medication, so ED Physician E ordered RN C to administer Narcan twice to Patient #1. RN C felt that Patient #1's increased sleepiness and not talking was due to a behavioral issue with Patient #1, and not an underlying medical problem.


4. During an interview on 3/2/22 at 12:20 PM, ED Physician E revealed they did not recall providing care to Patient #1. However, ED Physician E indicated that when they evaluated a patient to determine if the patient had sepsis (a life-threatening systemic infection), ED Physician E would perform laboratory testing, obtain blood cultures (to check the patient's blood for an infection), obtain urine cultures (to check the patient's urine for an infection), examine the patient, and determine if Patient #1 had exposure to potential infections. 

5. Review of Patient #1's medical record from Hospital #2 (located approximately 25 miles away) revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] after the ED staff discharged    Patient #1 from TRMC's emergency department. Upon arrival at Hospital #2's Emergency Department, the ED staff noted Patient #1 was lethargic, confused, and had an infected Stage IV pressure wound (a wound where the patient had lost all of the muscle and tissue in an area, resulting in exposure of the patient's bone).


6. Review of medical records revealed Patient #2, who was 29 weeks pregnant and had a history of anemia and asthma, arrived at the Trinity Regional Medical Center (TRMC) on 1/6/2022 at 7:10 PM. Registered Nurse (RN) B documented Patient #2 presented for complaints of cough, fever, leg cramps with high heart rate. RN B noted Patent #2 had a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, with heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and rated their pain at 4 (Moderate) on a scale of 1-10 (1 being almost no pain and 10 being the worst pain possible).

At 7:52 PM (42 minutes after Patient #2 arrived in the OB Department), RN B received orders from Obstetrician G over the phone to perform fetal heart tone monitoring (where the nursing staff monitored Patent #2's baby's heart rate and sounds), administer Tylenol to Patient #2, and screen Patient #2 for COVID-19. Patient #2's medical record lacked evidence of any further laboratory testing ordered by Obstetrician G, such as testing to determine the cause of Patient #2's fever.

At 8:29PM, RN B updated Obstetrician G about Patient #2's condition and RN B received orders to discharge Patient #2 from the hospital.

Patient #2's medical record lacked evidence that Patient #2 received a medical screening examination to determine the cause of Patient #2's fever, besides the testing for COVID-19. The medical record only contained evidence of the obstetrical medical screening examination.


7. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 3:33 PM, RN A recalled RN A took Patient #2 back to an obstetrical exam room in the obstetrical department, as Patient #2 arrived right at the time the nursing staff changed their shift. RN A did not provide any further care for Patient #2.

Normally, when a patient who is more than 20 weeks pregnant presents to the hospital's ED, the ED staff call the obstetrical unit to request the obstetrical nursing staff assess the patient. The obstetrical staff would request the ED staff to perform a medical screening examination to determine if the patient had an non-obstetrical emergency medical condition prior to sending the patient to the obstetrical unit. However, the obstetrical staff did not check to verify the emergency department staff had performed a medical screening examination on the patient prior to transferring the patient to the obstetrical unit. When a pregnant patient arrived on the obstetrical unit, regardless of their chief complaint, the obstetrical nursing staff evaluated the patient and performed an obstetrical medical screening examination. The obstetrical nursing staff would contact the on-call obstetrician and inform the obstetrician of their obstetrical exam findings. The obstetrician would provide verbal orders to the obstetrical nurse for any further testing on the patient, but would not normally come to the hospital to assess the patient, unless the patient was actively in labor.


8. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 4:15 PM, RN B acknowledged they were Patient #2's primary nurse when Patient #2 presented to the hospital's obstetrical department. However, RN B could not remember any of the care RN B provided to Patient #2. However, RN B indicated that when a patient who is more than 20 weeks pregnant presented to the hospital, the Emergency Department staff sent the patient to the obstetrical unit, regardless of the patient's chief complaint. When the patient arrived on the obstetrical unit, the obstetrical nurses would assess and triage the patient. The obstetrical nurses provided an obstetrical medical screening examination, contacted the on-call obstetrician, and then received any necessary orders from the on-call obstetrician. The obstetrician would not normally come into the hospital to assess the patient, unless the patient was in labor. After the nursing staff contacted the on-call obstetrician, the nursing staff would complete the paperwork for the patient, and the on-call obstetrician would sign the paperwork the following day, including the documentation of the obstetrical medical screening examination.



9. During an interview on 3/1/22 at 4:30 PM, Obstetrician G revealed that the Emergency Department staff sent all patients who are more than 20 weeks pregnant to the Obstetrical department, regardless if the patient's chief complaint involved an obstetrical problem. The obstetrical nursing staff would perform an obstetrical exam on the patients and then call Obstetrician G. Obstetrician G would talk with the obstetrical nurse and Obstetrician G would provide orders to the nurse for the patient. Obstetrician G indicated that the ED staff expected the obstetrical staff to perform both the medical screening examination for both the obstetrical concerns and the patient's other emergency medical concerns. Obstetrician G did not feel qualified to address a patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, but the ED staff did not want the obstetrical staff to transfer a pregnant patient back to the ED for management of the patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, especially if the ED was busy at the time.  Thus, even though Obstetrician G indicated they lacked knowledge to treat non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions, Obstetrician G had to treat the patient's non-obstetrical emergency medical conditions.

Based on document review and staff interviews, the hospital's administrative staff failed to ensure the hospital's emergency department staff followed the hospital's policies and  provided an adequate medical screening examination to 1 of 17 reviewed emergency department patients (Patient #1) and 1 of 3 reviewed obstetrical department patients (Patient #2). Failure follow the hospital's policies which required the ED staff to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #1, who then required emergency medical care at a hospital approximately 25 miles away for treatment of a life-threatening infection. Failure follow the hospital's policies which required the ED staff to provide an adequate medical screening examination resulted in the hospital staff discharging Patient #2 without screening Patient #2 to determine if Patient #2 had a non-obstetrical emergency medical condition. The hospital's administrative staff identified an average of approximately 1,800 patients per month who presented to the emergency department and requested a medical screening examination.

Findings include:


1. Review of the policy ""EMTALA: Transfer and Emergency Examination ED"", effective 1/2022, revealed in part, ""Each individual who seeks examination or treatment on Medical Center Premises shall be offered a medical screening examination to determine whether an emergency medical condition exsits ..."". The policy defined an emergency medical condition as ""A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical condition could reasonably be expected to result in: 1. Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant women, the health of the women or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, 2. Serious impairment of bodily functions, or 3. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part ...""

""A Medical Screening Exam (MSE)  ... [is the] process required to reach, with reasonable clinical confidence ...whether the individual has an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) or not ...a MSE appropriate to the individual's presenting signs and symptoms as well as the capability and capacity of the Medical Center ...""

"" ...the medical screening examination will occur in the Emergency Department except: pregnant women reporting contractions or having complications with pregnancy may be directed to the Birth Center for examination as appropriate (unless another medical condition require they be examined in the Emergency Department.)"".



2. Record review of Patient #1 revealed the following:

Based on interview, record review, and policy review the facility failed to provide a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) for one patient (#20) of 21 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) or the Obstetric (OB, the branch of medicine and surgery concerned with the childbirth and the care of women giving birth)  Department. This had the potential to affect all patients who presented to the ED or OB to obtain a MSE and were subsequently sent home or transferred to sister facility. The OB  average daily census was 12, the average monthly census was 360, and the total transfers was 17 for April through September 2014. The facility census was 55.   

Findings included:

1. Record review of the facility policy titled,""EMTALA: Emergency Medical Screening/Emergency Department Call Coverage,"" approved 06/24/14, showed a MSE refers to the process to determine if an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) exists. This screening must be done within the facility's capability and available personnel. The MSE is an ongoing process and the medical records must reflect continued monitoring based on the patient's needs and must continue until the patient is either stabilized or appropriately transferred.

2. During interviews on 10/14/14 at 1:50 PM and 2:10 PM, Staff E, Registered Nurse (RN) and Staff F, RN, both stated that if a patient presented to the ED and was less than 20 weeks pregnant she would be seen in the ED. If a patient was greater than 20 weeks pregnant she was seen by OB. The same practice was followed for patients who presented by ambulance.

3. Record review of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) form titled,""Patient Care Record,"" dated 09/26/14, showed EMS took Patient #20 to the OB Department. A nurse from the facility told the EMS staff that OB was overfilled. The facility staff failed to examine the patient prior to EMS transfer to facility B.

4. Record review of the ED and L&D log showed no evidence of Patient #20's arrival to the department. There was no medical record for Patient #20 available.

5. During a phone interview on 10/15/14 at 3:40 PM, Staff V, Paramedic, stated that upon arrival at the hospital OB unit with Patient #20, he was told by a nurse (he did not know which nurse) that OB was overfilled and maybe EMS could take the patient to another facility. Staff V stated that the nurse failed to even speak with the patient. EMS transferred the patient to facility B which had beds available. 

During an interview on 10/15/14 at 1:35 PM Staff BB, RN, stated when Patient #20 came in there were approximately five active labor patients, 3 of the 4 triage (exam rooms) were full. The Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) had 2 open beds. At approximately 2:00 AM on 09/26/14, Patient #20 was brought to OB by EMS crew per stretcher. Staff BB stated that she tried to reach EMS by phone before their arrival to possibly take the patient to a sister facility. Staff BB stated that the unit was busy and there was one triage room with an open bed for a patient. Staff BB stated to EMS that the patient may have to stay in the triage room after delivery until a room was available. At this time the patient declined to be transferred to the sister facility suggested by Staff BB. Staff BB, then overheard the EMS staff calling a hospital suggested by the family. Staff BB then stepped away to assist in a delivery room. A short time later Staff BB received a phone call from facility B. The caller requested that if a patient was being transferred, that the physician should call facility B with a patient report and a specific telephone number was given. Staff BB then returned to the entrance of OB unit and observed that EMS and the patient were not present.

During an interview on 10/15/14 at 1:00 PM Staff L, Director of Peri-Natal (all obstetric services), stated that she would have expected Patient #20 to be evaluated in triage and a MSE performed.

Based on findings from interview and document review, the facility did not ensure that all individuals presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) or other areas (obstetrical (OB)  unit) are entered into a central log. The lack of a central  log in the OB unit does not ensure care provided to these individuals can be tracked.

Findings include:

-- Per interview of Staff C, ED Nurse Manager on 10/18/16 at 10:50 am, patients presenting to the ED, who are 20 weeks gestation or greater, are triaged by a registered nurse (RN)  and if stable are directed to the OB unit for a medical screening exam (MSE). The triage nurse completes the form titled ""OB Patient Triage Record"" and faxes it to the OB unit. These patients are not entered into the ED Central Log.

 -- Per interview of Staff H, Charge Nurse OB unit on 10/18/16 at 1:30 pm, patients presenting to the ED who are greater than 20 weeks gestation are transported to the OB Unit for a MSE. The OB unit does not maintain a central log of OB patients transported from the ED for MSE. 

-- Review of facilities policies and procedures (P&P) did not provide evidence that the facilty had established P&P on a process for OB unit staff to maintain a central log of these patients.

Based on staff interview and review of medical records, it was determined that the facility did not effectively meet the requirements for providing necessary stabilizing treatment of patient presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). Specifically, (a) when the determination is made that there is a need for further medical examination and treatment and the individual refuses to consent for further evaluation/treatment, then the hospital takes all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal, (b) the written informed refusal documentation indicates that the person was informed of the risks as well as the benefits of further examination, treatment, or both. 
This was evident in three (3) of four (4) emergency department records reviewed for patients who left the ED against medical advice (AMA); MR's (# 1, # 2 and # 3).

Findings include: 
MR # 1 was reviewed on 7/27 /2015 via electronic, and hard copy (certified copy) on 7/29/2015 at approximately 10:00 AM.  It was noted that this [AGE] year old patient, with medical history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, walked into the facility's ED on 2/11/2015 at 1:02 PM. The chief complaint was chest pain.  The patient was triaged on 2/11/2015 1:09 PM and was assigned Triage Category ESI (Emergency Severity Index) 3- Urgent.  Vital Signs: Temperature 96.7, Blood Pressure 165/88 & Respirations 23; Pain scale - 4/10 (on a pain scale of 1 to 10).

The medical examination was performed on 2/14/2015 at 9:43 PM and a Transvaginal Ultrasound (US) was done, and the result showed large Subchorionic Hemorrhage. The physician noted that the patient decided to leave AMA without getting blood typing or repeat vital signs.  The physician documentation noted ""the patient was oriented about the importance of waiting for lab results but she refused to stay; she signed to leave against medical advice."" 
A copy of the AMA form which detailed the risks and benefits of the patient not staying for a complete evaluation and the informed refusal from the patient was not located in the record.

MR # 3 was reviewed on 7/27/2015 via electronic, and hard copy (certified copy) on 7/29/2015 at approximately 10:15 AM. This [AGE] year old patient with history of DVT/PE (Deep Vein Thrombosis/ Pulmonary Embolism) and Asthma, (MDS) dated [DATE] at 4:28 AM with chief complaint of difficulty breathing and chest pain. The patient also complained of swelling of left leg x 4 days. The patient was triaged on 4/1/2015 at 4:35 AM; Vital Signs: Temperature 96.8, Blood Pressure 121/78, Respirations 20 & O2 98%; Pain Scale: 6/10 and was assigned category ESI 3- Urgent. The patient had a nursing reassessment on 4/1/2015 at 6:47AM and an EKG completed on 4/1/2015 6:51 AM. The physician examination was electronically signed 4/1/2015 08:02 AM. The discharge disposition was patient left AMA. There was a physician notation in the record, ""signed AMA after explanation of possible chronic pain, permanent disability and and sudden death.""
There was no documentation that the patient had an emergency medical condition and that the need for further evaluation/treatment was explained to the patient. It was also noted that a completed copy of the AMA form describing that the risks and benefits of further evaluation and treatment was discussed with the patient and the informed refusal from the patient, was not located in the record. 

Staff #1 was interviewed on 7/29/ 2015 at 2:20 PM. This staff reviewed the medical records MR's (# 1, # 2 and # 3) and stated that he will follow-up with the necessary documents on 7/30/2015.
On 7/30/2014 at 12:15 PM, Staff # 1 provided this surveyor a copy of a ""A Discharge from Hospital Against Medical Advice"" form, dated 2/11/2015 and signed by the patient, MR #1.   The language on the form is as follows: ""This is to certify that I (am leaving the hospital/am taking ------ (patient's name written in blank space) against the advice of both attending physicians and hospital authorities."" It was determined that the AMA forms given to patients does not meet the requirement of fully explaining to the patient the benefits and risks of leaving the hospital before a complete evaluation was done, instead, it is releasing all physicians and the hospital and its staff from any liability when the patient leaves before discharge.  
It was also noted that the person who signed the ""witness section"" of the form did not complete the ""relationship section"" of the form.

Based on staff interview and review of medical records, it was determined that the facility did not effectively meet the requirements for providing necessary stabilizing treatment of patient presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). Specifically, (a) when the determination is made that there is a need for further medical examination and treatment and the individual refuses to consent for further evaluation/treatment, then the hospital takes all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal, (b) the written informed refusal documentation indicates that the person was informed of the risks as well as the benefits of further examination, treatment, or both. 
This was evident in three (3) of four (4) emergency department records reviewed for patients who left the ED against medical advice (AMA); MR's (# 1, # 2 and # 3).

Findings include: 
MR # 1 was reviewed on 7/27 /2015 via electronic, and hard copy (certified copy) on 7/29/2015 at approximately 10:00 AM.  It was noted that this [AGE] year old patient, with medical history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, walked into the facility's ED on 2/11/2015 at 1:02 PM. The chief complaint was chest pain.  The patient was triaged on 2/11/2015 1:09 PM and was assigned Triage Category ESI (Emergency Severity Index) 3- Urgent.

Based on review of the ED log, Family and Birth Center log, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policies and procedures, tour, staff interviews, observations, credential files, and personnel files,  it was determined that the facility failed to  provide an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to determine whether of not an emergency medical condition existed  for one (1) of 23 sampled medical records when Patient #1 presented to the Obstetric (OB - related to childbirth) assessment area requesting services for  evaluation of her medical condition.

Findings were:

During the entrance conference on 5/13/19 at 10:00 a.m. with the System Director of Accreditation, System Manager of Accreditation and Accreditation Improvement Consultant, a request for the Emergency Department (ED) central log and Family and Birth Center central log was requested.  A review of the logs revealed Patient #1 had not been entered into either of these logs as of 5/13/19 at 10:40 a.m.  

Review of the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, Amended November 2016, adopted by the Medical Executive Committee and signed by the Chief of Staff 11/21/06, and approved by the Board and signed by the President/Chief Executive Officer 11/30/16 revealed the following:
EMERGENCY SERVICES
2.  Medical Screening Exam (MSE) - All patients who arrive at the ED for evaluation or care are required under EMTALA law to have a MSE done and to have stabilizing treatment, if unstable. MSEs in the ED must be done by a physician, nurse practitioner (NP) or a physician assistant (PA) under the direct supervision of a physician.  For medical screening exams related to Obstetrical (related to pregnancy and/or delivery) patients refer to ""Obstetrics"" (OB) section of these Rules and Regulations.
OBSTETRICS
Medical Screening Exams
All obstetrical patients presenting for evaluation or treatment through the ED or Obstetrical unit must receive a MSE to determine the patient's medical condition and/or labor status. The results of the MSE will indicate whether or not the patient's medical condition is stable or unstable. Those with an unstable condition will receive treatment to stabilize the medical condition to the extent the condition can be treated with available resources. The results of the MSE will indicate whether or not the patient is in active labor.
--MSEs Performed in ED
Patients who present to the ED in the process of imminent delivery or those who are unstable, will be seen and treated initially in the ED by the ED physician, NP or PA under the direct supervision of a physician.
OB patients in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy will be seen in the ED. The obstetrician/gynecology (OB/GYN - specialty dealing with pregnancy and delivery/female reproductive organs) resident on-call should be consulted, if/when deemed necessary by the ED physician.
OB patients who present to the ED after the first 14 weeks by history, with the exception of pregnant trauma patients, who have had their pregnancy confirmed by a positive urine or blood pregnancy test performed in the ED with a pregnancy related problem will be evaluated in OB Assessment.
Obstetrical patients who present to the ED as pregnant trauma patients will be evaluated by the ED physician, NP or PA regardless of weeks pregnant by history. (Refer to the ED OB Assessment Policy)
--MSEs Performed in OB Assessment
Patients who present to the ED in the process of eminent delivery or those who are unstable, regardless of gestational age (number of weeks pregnant), will be seen and treated initially in the ED by the ED physician, NP or PA under the direct supervision of a physician.
OB patients in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy will be seen in the ED. The OB/GYN resident on call should be consulted, if/when deemed necessary by the ED physician.
OB patients who present to the ED greater than 14 weeks pregnant by history, with the exception of pregnant trauma patients, who have had their pregnancy confirmed by a positive urine or blood pregnancy test performed in the ED with a pregnancy-related problem will be evaluated in OB Assessment.
Obstetrical patients who present to the Obstetrical Unit will be directed to the OB Assessment Area. These patients will be triaged and those who have a non-obstetrical problem, regardless of gestational age, will be directed to the ED as all other Emergency Services patients. Patients who remain in the OB assessment area who have a pregnancy related problem will have a MSE performed by a physician or qualified medical professional (QMP) qualified Registered Nurse using medical staff approved criteria. (Refer to Labor and Delivery Policy).

If a pregnant patient decides to leave prior to receiving a medical screening or treatment, the OB RN/ QMP will counsel the patient regarding the risks of leaving without treatment. The OB RN/ QMP will document the counseling on the MSE Record along with having the patient sign the AMA forms.

On 5/13/19 at 10:15 a.m. a tour of the ED was conducted with the Assistant Vice President (AVP) GG and the Manager of Patient Access Navigation HH.  The ED was observed to have 60 beds, five (5) of which were fast track beds.  There were two (2) triage (assessment by a nurse to determine the priority in which patients will be seen by a practitioner based on their chief complaint, presenting signs and symptoms).  In addition, the AVP GG explained that the facility also has a Children's Hospital that has six (6) beds, seven (7) trauma rooms and 10 observation beds.  AVP GG explained that physicians and/or midlevels (Nurse Practitioners or Physician Assistants) perform the medical screening examination (MSE) in the ED.  AVP GG further explained that pregnant women who present to the ED who are less than 14 weeks pregnant or have a non-pregnancy related complaint are evaluated in the ED by ED staff, the Obstetric (OB - specialty that provides care for pregnancy and childbirth needs) Department is notified and an OB staff member comes to the ED to assist with the patient's care.  AVP GG said pregnant women that are 14 weeks pregnant or greater or have any pregnancy related complaints are accompanied to the Family Birth Center for assessment by an OB assessment nurse.  AVP GG confirmed that entering a patient into the ED central log automatically generates a medical record.  EMTALA signage was observed in the ED entrance way between the outer and inner electronic doors, in the ED waiting room, in a second waiting room and in the ambulance entrance.   

On 5/13/19 at 10:40 a.m. a tour of the Family Birth Center was conducted with the AVP GG and the Manager of Patient Access Navigation HH.  The Director DD of the Family Birth Center explained that there are four (4) OB assessment rooms, 10 Labor and Delivery (L&D) rooms, 11 antepartum (before birth) rooms and 23 postpartum (after delivery) rooms.  Director DD explained that OB assessment RNs who have completed OB assessment criteria/competency perform the MSE on the Family Birth Center unit.  Director DD said that after the RN completes the MSE the on-call physician is notified with the results and for any necessary orders.  Director DD explained that RN EE (the nurse who evaluated Patient #1) was being oriented to the OB assessment unit on 4/30/19.  Director DD went on to explain that RN EE transferred to the Family Birth Center from another unit almost a year ago and was still in the process of being oriented to the OB assessment area on 4/30/19.  The Director said all new Family and Birth Center staff must work on the unit for a period of time before being oriented to the OB assessment unit.  Director DD explained that entering a patient into the Family and Birth Center log automatically generates a medical record, she confirmed that Patient #1 was not entered into the Family and Birth Center log and therefore, there was no medical record generated for the patient.  EMTALA signage was noted right across from the elevator doors, in the Family and Birth Center waiting room, in the visitors' snack room and in the OB assessment waiting room.  

On 5/13/19 at 7:00 p.m., a telephone interview was conducted with Triage Assistant/Emergency Medical Technician (TA/EMT) CC.  TA/EMT CC confirmed he has worked in the facility's ED for 15 years.  TA/EMT CC explained that OB patients present to the ED desk and inform the Registration Clerk that they are pregnant and how far along they are, if the patient is greater than 14 weeks the Registration Clerk will call and ask me to take the patient up to the OB assessment area.  TA/EMT CC stated that he remembers being called to the registration desk to take Patient #1 up to the OB assessment area.  TA/EMT CC said Patient #1 informed him that she was 34 weeks pregnant and was having pain in her lower abdomen and back.  TA/EMT CC explained that he called the OB assessment area and informed the nurse (EE) that he was bringing a 34 weeks pregnant patient up.  TA/EMT CC stated the OB assessment nurse (EE) asked for the patient's doctor's name and after being told the doctor's name the nurse replied, don't bring her (Patient #1) up she needs to go to the hospital where her doctor has privileges.  TA/EMT CC said that by then he was on the elevator with the patient and when he arrived at the OB assessment area with Patient #1 a ""nurse (EE) met us at the door and told the patient that she could not be seen here and that she would have to go to the hospital where her physician has privileges.  TA/EMT CC confirmed that he has had EMTALA training and that it is required at least once a year.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedures were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed and/or the labor status for patient #1 when she presented to the L&D unit on April 30, 2019.

During an interview on 5/13/19 at 9:40 a.m. in the Quality Conference Room, RN FF explained that she has worked at the hospital for 11 years and has worked in the Family and Birth Center since 2013.  RN FF said she has been working in the OB assessment area for at least two (2) years.  RN FF said that the training for the OB assessment area includes the following:  
--circulating in surgery for cesarean sections, tubal ligations, and hysterectomies,
--monitoring the unborn baby's heart rate, and
--checking the cervix (lower portion of the uterus) for dilation, effacement (thinning of the cervix for delivery) and station (progression of delivery). 
RN FF went on to explain that the first steps for women that present to the OB assessment area is as follows:  
--patient signs-in and states why she is here,  
--patient states her gestation (how many weeks pregnant), 
--patient is asked who her doctor is, 
--a nurse does an assessment/physical examination and if the patient is having contractions and is at full-term the nurse will check the patient's cervix; the nurse will wait an hour and then re-check the patient and notify the physician.  RN FF said the physician will then determine whether the patient is to be admitted    .  RN FF explained that on 4/30/19 RN EE had the OB assessment phone and RN EE would have received the call from the ED.  RN FF said she was orienting RN EE and had not been notified that a patient was being brought up from the ED.  RN FF stated she never saw Patient #1 and that she (RN FF) and the Charge nurse were informed by RN EE that Patient #1 decided to leave after being informed that her (Patient #1) doctor did not have privileges here.  RN FF said that she and the Charge Nurse told RN EE that she had handled the situation correctly.  RN FF said that she has since been informed not to tell a patient that her doctor does not have privileges until after the patient is signed in and then if the patient decides to leave the patient is asked to sign an Against Medical Advice (AMA) form.  RN FF said that she has completed corporate compliance and that she believes EMTALA is part of it.  

During an interview on 5/13/19 at 10:10 a.m. in the Quality Conference Room, RN EE explained that she has worked at the hospital for since January 2015 and has worked in the Family and Birth Center since July 2018.  RN EE stated she began training to work OB assessment in March 2019.  RN EE confirmed that on 4/30/19 she had the OB assessment phone and received a call from TA/EMT CC informing her that he was bringing a 34 weeks pregnant patient up.  RN EE said that she asked the name of the patient's physician and after being informed of the physician's name she told TA/EMT CC that the patient's physician did not have privileges.  RN EE said she told AT/EMT CC that typically that physician's patients are seen at another local hospital. RN EE said that she met the patient at the door to the OB assessment area and when the patient provided the name of her doctor I (RN EE) explained that the patient's doctor did not have privileges, and practices at another local hospital.  RN EE said Patient #1 asked if anyone else could see her and I (RN EE) said yes but it won't be your doctor and your doctor won't be involved with your care.  RN EE said the patient said she would rather go to the other hospital and be treated by her doctor.  RN EE said she did not try to get the patient to sign an AMA form.  RN EE explained that the process for patients presenting to the OB assessment area include the following:
--registration, 
--ask the chief complaint/reason for the visit, 
--patient's doctor's name, 
--due date, 
--copy the patient's identification, and
--two (2) nurses or a nurse and technician help the patient put on a gown, obtain a urine sample, a nurse performs assessment/physical examination and obtains the medical history, if the patient is over 24 weeks pregnant a continuous fetal heart monitor is attached to the patient, if the patient is less than 24 weeks pregnant a nurse gets a fetal heart tone, these findings are reported to the physician who makes the determination as to whether to admit.  
RN EE confirmed that she has been educated on EMTALA.  

Review of two (2) credential files (AA and BB) and three (3) personnel files (CC, EE and FF) revealed all five (5) staff members had received EMTALA training between 10/10/17 and 2/26/19.  In addition, the OB RN FF's personnel file had documented evidence of completing the required competencies for working in the OB assessment area.  At the time Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] RN EE was in the process of the required orientation period to the OB assessment area.

Based on review of the ED log, Family and Birth Center log, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policies and procedures, tour, staff interviews, observations, credential files, and personnel files,  it was determined that the facility failed to  provide an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to determine whether of not an emergency medical condition existed  for one (1) of 23 sampled medical records when Patient #1 presented to the Obstetric (OB - related to childbirth) assessment area requesting services for  evaluation of her medical condition.

Findings were:

During the entrance conference on 5/13/19 at 10:00 a.m. with the System Director of Accreditation, System Manager of Accreditation and Accreditation Improvement Consultant, a request for the Emergency Department (ED) central log and Family and Birth Center central log was requested.  A review of the logs revealed Patient #1 had not been entered into either of these logs as of 5/13/19 at 10:40 a.m.  

Review of the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, Amended November 2016, adopted by the Medical Executive Committee and signed by the Chief of Staff 11/21/06, and approved by the Board and signed by the President/Chief Executive Officer 11/30/16 revealed the following:
EMERGENCY SERVICES
2.  Medical Screening Exam (MSE) - All patients who arrive at the ED for evaluation or care are required under EMTALA law to have a MSE done and to have stabilizing treatment, if unstable. MSEs in the ED must be done by a physician, nurse practitioner (NP) or a physician assistant (PA) under the direct supervision of a physician.  For medical screening exams related to Obstetrical (related to pregnancy and/or delivery) patients refer to ""Obstetrics"" (OB) section of these Rules and Regulations.
OBSTETRICS
Medical Screening Exams
All obstetrical patients presenting for evaluation or treatment through the ED or Obstetrical unit must receive a MSE to determine the patient's medical condition and/or labor status. The results of the MSE will indicate whether or not the patient's medical condition is stable or unstable. Those with an unstable condition will receive treatment to stabilize the medical condition to the extent the condition can be treated with available resources. The results of the MSE will indicate whether or not the patient is in active labor.
--MSEs Performed in ED
Patients who present to the ED in the process of imminent delivery or those who are unstable, will be seen and treated initially in the ED by the ED physician, NP or PA under the direct supervision of a physician.
OB patients in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy will be seen in the ED. The obstetrician/gynecology (OB/GYN - specialty dealing with pregnancy and delivery/female reproductive organs) resident on-call should be consulted, if/when deemed necessary by the ED physician.
OB patients who present to the ED after the first 14 weeks by history, with the exception of pregnant trauma patients, who have had their pregnancy confirmed by a positive urine or blood  performed in the ED with a pregnancy related problem will be evaluated in OB Assessment.
Obstetrical patients who present to the ED as pregnant trauma patients will be evaluated by the ED physician, NP or PA regardless of weeks pregnant by history. (Refer to the ED OB Assessment Policy)
--MSEs Performed in OB Assessment
Patients who present to the ED in the process of eminent delivery or those who are unstable, regardless of gestational age (number of weeks pregnant), will be seen and treated initially in the ED by the ED physician, NP or PA under the direct supervision of a physician.
OB patients in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy will be seen in the ED. The OB/GYN resident on call should be consulted, if/when deemed necessary by the ED physician.
OB patients who present to the ED greater than 14 weeks pregnant by history, with the exception of pregnant trauma patients, who have had their pregnancy confirmed by a positive urine or blood  performed in the ED with a pregnancy-related problem will be evaluated in OB Assessment.
Obstetrical patients who present to the Obstetrical Unit will be directed to the OB Assessment Area. These patients will be triaged and those who have a non-obstetrical problem, regardless of gestational age, will be directed to the ED as all other Emergency Services patients. Patients who remain in the OB assessment area who have a pregnancy related problem will have a MSE performed by a physician or qualified medical professional (QMP) qualified Registered Nurse using medical staff approved criteria. (Refer to Labor and Delivery Policy).

On 5/13/19 at 10:15 a.m. a tour of the ED was conducted with the Assistant Vice President (AVP) GG and the Manager of Patient Access Navigation HH.  The ED was observed to have 60 beds, five (5) of which were fast track beds.  There were two (2) triage (assessment by a nurse to determine the priority in which patients will be seen by a practitioner based on their chief complaint, presenting signs and symptoms).  In addition, the AVP GG explained that the facility also has a Children's Hospital that has six (6) beds, seven (7) trauma rooms and 10 observation beds.  AVP GG explained that physicians and/or midlevels (Nurse Practitioners or Physician Assistants) perform the medical screening examination (MSE) in the ED.  AVP GG further explained that pregnant women who present to the ED who are less than 14 weeks pregnant or have a non-pregnancy related complaint are evaluated in the ED by ED staff, the Obstetric (OB - specialty that provides care for  needs) Department is notified and an OB staff member comes to the ED to assist with the patient's care.  AVP GG said pregnant women that are 14 weeks pregnant or greater or have any pregnancy related complaints are accompanied to the Family Birth Center for assessment by an OB assessment nurse.  AVP GG confirmed that entering a patient into the ED central log automatically generates a medical record.  EMTALA signage was observed in the ED entrance way between the outer and inner electronic doors, in the ED waiting room, in a second waiting room and in the ambulance entrance.   

On 5/13/19 at 10:40 a.m. a tour of the Family Birth Center was conducted with the AVP GG and the Manager of Patient Access Navigation HH.  The Director DD of the Family Birth Center explained that there are four (4) OB assessment rooms, 10 Labor and Delivery (L&D) rooms, 11 antepartum (before birth) rooms and 23 postpartum (after delivery) rooms.  Director DD explained that OB assessment RNs who have completed OB assessment criteria/competency perform the MSE on the Family Birth Center unit.  Director DD said that after the RN completes the MSE the on-call physician is notified with the results and for any necessary orders.  Director DD explained that RN EE (the nurse who evaluated Patient #1) was being oriented to the OB assessment unit on 4/30/19.  Director DD went on to explain that RN EE transferred to the Family Birth Center from another unit almost a year ago and was still in the process of being oriented to the OB assessment area on 4/30/19.  The Director said all new Family and Birth Center staff must work on the unit for a period of time before being oriented to the OB assessment unit.  Director DD explained that entering a patient into the Family and Birth Center log automatically generates a medical record, she confirmed that Patient #1 was not entered into the Family and Birth Center log and therefore, there was no medical record generated for the patient.  EMTALA signage was noted right across from the elevator doors, in the Family and Birth Center waiting room, in the visitors' snack room and in the OB assessment waiting room.  

On 5/13/19 at 7:00 p.m., a telephone interview was conducted with Triage Assistant/Emergency Medical Technician (TA/EMT) CC.  TA/EMT CC confirmed he has worked in the facility's ED for 15 years.  TA/EMT CC explained that OB patients present to the ED desk and inform the Registration Clerk that they are pregnant and how far along they are, if the patient is greater than 14 weeks the Registration Clerk will call and ask me to take the patient up to the OB assessment area.  TA/EMT CC stated that he remembers being called to the registration desk to take Patient #1 up to the OB assessment area.  TA/EMT CC said Patient #1 informed him that she was 34 weeks pregnant and was having pain in her lower abdomen and back.  TA/EMT CC explained that he called the OB assessment area and informed the nurse (EE) that he was bringing a 34 weeks pregnant patient up.  TA/EMT CC stated the OB assessment nurse (EE) asked for the patient's doctor's name and after being told the doctor's name the nurse replied, don't bring her (Patient #1) up she needs to go to the hospital where her doctor has privileges.  TA/EMT CC said that by then he was on the elevator with the patient and when he arrived at the OB assessment area with Patient #1 a ""nurse (EE) met us at the door and told the patient that she could not be seen here and that she would have to go to the hospital where her physician has privileges.  TA/EMT CC confirmed that he has had EMTALA training and that it is required at least once a year.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedures were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed and/or the labor status for patient #1 when she presented to the L&D unit on April 30, 2019.

During an interview on 5/13/19 at 9:40 a.m. in the Quality Conference Room, RN FF explained that she has worked at the hospital for 11 years and has worked in the Family and Birth Center since 2013.  RN FF said she has been working in the OB assessment area for at least two (2) years.  RN FF said that the training for the OB assessment area includes the following:  
--circulating in surgery for cesarean sections, tubal ligations, and hysterectomies,
--monitoring the unborn baby's heart rate, and
--checking the cervix (lower portion of the uterus) for dilation, effacement (thinning of the cervix for delivery) and station (progression of delivery). 
RN FF went on to explain that the first steps for women that present to the OB assessment area is as follows:  
--patient signs-in and states why she is here,  
--patient states her gestation (how many weeks pregnant), 
--patient is asked who her doctor is, 
--a nurse does an assessment/physical examination and if the patient is having contractions and is at full-term the nurse will check the patient's cervix; the nurse will wait an hour and then re-check the patient and notify the physician.  RN FF said the physician will then determine whether the patient is to be admitted    .  RN FF explained that on 4/30/19 RN EE had the OB assessment phone and RN EE would have received the call from the ED.  RN FF said she was orienting RN EE and had not been notified that a patient was being brought up from the ED.  RN FF stated she never saw Patient #1 and that she (RN FF) and the Charge nurse were informed by RN EE that Patient #1 decided to leave after being informed that her (Patient #1) doctor did not have privileges here.  RN FF said that she and the Charge Nurse told RN EE that she had handled the situation correctly.  RN FF said that she has since been informed not to tell a patient that her doctor does not have privileges until after the patient is signed in and then if the patient decides to leave the patient is asked to sign an Against Medical Advice (AMA) form.  RN FF said that she has completed corporate compliance and that she believes EMTALA is part of it.  

During an interview on 5/13/19 at 10:10 a.m. in the Quality Conference Room, RN EE explained that she has worked at the hospital for since January 2015 and has worked in the Family and Birth Center since July 2018.  RN EE stated she began training to work OB assessment in March 2019.  RN EE confirmed that on 4/30/19 she had the OB assessment phone and received a call from TA/EMT CC informing her that he was bringing a 34 weeks pregnant patient up.  RN EE said that she asked the name of the patient's physician and after being informed of the physician's name she told TA/EMT CC that the patient's physician did not have privileges.  RN EE said she told AT/EMT CC that typically that physician's patients are seen at another local hospital. RN EE said that she met the patient at the door to the OB assessment area and when the patient provided the name of her doctor I (RN EE) explained that the patient's doctor did not have privileges, and practices at another local hospital.  RN EE said Patient #1 asked if anyone else could see her and I (RN EE) said yes but it won't be your doctor and your doctor won't be involved with your care.  RN EE said the patient said she would rather go to the other hospital and be treated by her doctor.  RN EE said she did not try to get the patient to sign an AMA form.  RN EE explained that the process for patients presenting to the OB assessment area include the following:
--registration, 
--ask the chief complaint/reason for the visit, 
--patient's doctor's name, 
--due date, 
--copy the patient's identification, and
--two (2) nurses or a nurse and technician help the patient put on a gown, obtain a urine sample, a nurse performs assessment/physical examination and obtains the medical history, if the patient is over 24 weeks pregnant a continuous fetal heart monitor is attached to the patient, if the patient is less than 24 weeks pregnant a nurse gets a fetal heart tone, these findings are reported to the physician who makes the determination as to whether to admit.  
RN EE confirmed that she has been educated on EMTALA.  

Review of two (2) credential files (AA and BB) and three (3) personnel files (CC, EE and FF) revealed all five (5) staff members had received EMTALA training between 10/10/17 and 2/26/19.  In addition, the OB RN FF's personnel file had documented evidence of completing the required competencies for working in the OB assessment area.  At the time Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] RN EE was in the process of the required orientation period to the OB assessment area.

Based on staff interview, Emergency Department (ED) record review,  policy and procedure (P&P) and other document review, the hospital failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination conducted by an individual (s) who was determined qualified by hospital bylaws, or rules and regulations, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) existed, for 7 of 20 ED patients reviewed (Patients 1, 9, 11, 13, 18, 19 and 20), as evidenced by: 

1. The emergency room    physician, MD 1, failed to perform appropriate assessments and provide care based on that assessment for Patient 1. 

2. Patient 9 did not receive MSE by qualified medical practitioner (QMP) upon presenting to the hospital for psychiatric emergency medical condition (EMC). The Labor and Delivery (L&D) registered nurse (RN) performing a MSE for patients presenting to L&D unit failed to evaluate Patient 9' presenting complaint of psychiatric problem.

3. The hospital failed to implement the hospital's policies for Triaging patients for patients 11, 13, 18, 19 and 20.

Findings:

1. The emergency room    physician, MD 1, failed to perform appropriate assessments and provide care based on that assessment for Patient 1.

Review of emergency room    (ER) medical record on 4/10/13 showed that on 8/17/12 Patient 1 was brought to the ER  on 8/17/12 at 8:55 a.m. by ambulance. The ambulance record showed that the ambulance was called for complaint of ""convulsions/seizures"". The ambulance documentation showed the following: upon arrival at site Patient 1, a [AGE] years old female, was found alert and oriented times two, being taken out of shower by her husband and paramedics secondary to seizure-like activity. Per husband's report, Patient 1 was experiencing vertigo, felt hot and decided to take a shower to cool-off. The husband reported hearing ""thud"" and found his wife in the shower in ""the decorticate posture"" and unresponsive. (Decorticate posture is an abnormal posturing in which a person is stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight). The husband reported no seizures history for Patient 1 and no recent trauma. The ambulance documentation showed that by the time of arrival to the ER  Patient 1 was alert and oriented times four and was complaining of pain in the right side of her back resulting from the fall in the shower. Ambulance staff documented, that Patient 1 had a bruising of mid-right side of her back.  The section ""impression"" noted ""Change in Responsiveness"" and ""Seizure, Diabetic symptoms.""  The ambulance notes documented that report was called to the hospital ER  via Radio at 8:43 a.m.

The ER  triage notes on 8/17/12 showed the following documentation in Patient 1 ER  record:

Triage time 8:59 a.m. by Registered Nurse (RN) 1 
Chief complaint: back pain
Vital signs: Blood Pressure (B/P) 106/65; Heart rate (HR) 73; Respiratory Rate (RR) 16 and Temperature (T) 96 auxiliary (armpit)

History by RN 1 at 9:21 a.m.: 
""This started today. Relates the location as in the right flank area. History of recent trauma (felt dizzy in shower and fell   ). (Does not remember fall or events).""
Past medical history: vertigo

Physical Assessment by RN 1 at 9:23 a.m.: ""0900. Alert. Oriented x4. (speech slightly slurred). Respirations not labored. Normal heart rate and rhythm. Cardiac rhythm: normal sinus rhythm. Emesis noted. Has vomited several times. Abdomen soft.  Bowel sound within normal limits. Soft tissue tenderness. Capillary refill less than 2 seconds and is greater than 2 seconds. Sensation intact in extremities. ROM (range of motion) within normal limits.""

Nursing Progress note by RN 1 at 9:23 a.m. indicated that at 8:58 a.m. Patient 1 was gowned, placed on a monitor and ready for evaluation ""chart flagged.""  
At 9:45 a.m. RN 1 documented that the husband was at the patient's bedside.

At 10:09 a.m. another RN (RN 2) documented the following medications were administered to Patient 1:
Ativan (antianxiety medication) 1 mg (milligrams) PO (by mouth)
Meclizine (medication for dizziness) 2 mg PO
Zofran (medication for nausea) 4 mg diluted with NS (Normal Saline) slow IVP (injected into blood vessel via intravenous catheter) 
RN 2 noted that medications were for anxiety and nausea. 

Review of Physician orders showed the above medications along with orders for blood work and EKG were documented by the ER  physician (MD 1) at 10:05 a.m.

RN 2 documented the following vital signs at 10:13 a.m.: BP 122/80; HR 80; RR 16; Oxygen Saturation on room air 96 percent. 

Next entries were related to the patient discharge at 11:27-11:30 a.m. documented under the name of RN 1, with a note by RN 3 below those entries, that RN 3 in fact documented the discharge entries. The discharge entries included information that IV was discontinued, fall risk assessments was completed and no fall risk identified, discharge instructions provided and reviewed with the patient and the patient verbalized understanding. The patient was noted discharged    home accompanied by spouse. Vital signs at 11:30 a.m. were documented: BP 135/86; HR 66; RR 22; Oxygen Saturation on room air 96 percent. The nurse documented that Patient 1's condition at departure was unchanged.

Review of the ER  nursing notes showed no pain treatment and no pain reassessment after initial pain was documented 8/10 in triage. No evaluation of effectiveness of medications administered for vertigo, anxiety and nausea to Patient 1 by RN 2 was documented. 

In an interview on 4/12/13 at 12:25 p.m. RN 3 stated that typically she was scheduled and arrived in the ED to start her shift at 10:30 -11 a.m. with providing breaks to other nursing staff.  After reviewing Patient 1's ED record, RN 3 confirmed that she discharged    Patient 1 as noted above, that if the physician discharged    the patient she would so note. RN 3 confirmed that she did not perform assessment of the patient's condition, including pain level, prior to discharge.

In an on-site interview on 4/12/13 at 11:50 a.m. RN 2 confirmed that he answered the radio call from the ambulance alerting the ER  that the ambulance was bringing Patient 1 to the ER  in 10 minutes as indicated in a document titled ""Regional Base Hospital Form"" signed by RN 2. RN 2 confirmed he documented on the Form that Patient 1's chief complaint was seizure activity, fall, and postictal (altered state of consciousness that a person enters after experiencing a seizure). RN 2 stated that he did not recall Patient 1, but per record review he administered medications to Patient 1 as documented above. RN 2 admitted     that he did not evaluate the effectiveness of the medications and the response of Patient 1 to the medications administered. RN 2 stated that he was not assigned to Patient 1, that he was only helping RN 1 with the patient care. RN 2 confirmed that there was no nursing assessment related to the medications administered. RN 2 also acknowledged that the ER  record showed no documentation that Patient 1's pain was re-assessed during the ER  stay, after the initial pain scale showed 8/10 pain (severe pain). RN 2 stated that normally a primary ED nurse would perform ongoing assessments, but probably no primary ED RN was assigned to the patient because one staff called off sick and the ED was short of staff that morning.

In an interview on 4/12/13 at 11:50 a.m. the ED Manager confirmed that no primary nurse was assigned to Patient 1 for the ED visit on 8/17/12 due to staff calling off sick, per staffing sheets review.

In an on-site interview on 4/10/13 at 3:25 p.m. RN 1 stated that she remembered Patient 1. RN 1 was the triage nurse as well as the charge nurse. RN 1 believed that RN 2 was assigned to the patient as the primary ED nurse. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 was the first of three ambulances arriving within 10 minutes. RN 1 recalled that ambulance medic reported that the initial call for Patient 1 was for seizures. Upon arrival the ambulance medic reported fall, loss of consciousness and possible syncopal episode, and back pain. RN 1 stated it was a verbal report and that the medic's documentation usually came later, after it was downloaded to the computer system, so the ER  staff probably did not have access to the written report initially. RN 1 quickly triaged Patient 1 and went to greet the other two ambulances. RN 1 stated that she documented the initial assessment, pain 8/10, and bruising to the patient back. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 arrived on gurney positioned on her stomach for comfort, because of her back pain. The patient's speech was slightly slurred. RN 1 admitted     she knew the ambulance call was for seizures but did not document the reported information about the pre-hospital care for Patient 1, only that the patient arrived via EMS.  RN 1 stated that the expectation was for the primary ER  nurse to perform a complete assessment and document. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 was taken directly to a treatment room and the physician (MD 1) came to the treatment room while the ambulance medics were giving verbal report on Patient 1.

In reviewing the ER  record RN 1 confirmed that there was no documentation of other RNs checking on Patient 1 (evaluating and assessing the patient). RN 2 only documented medications administered and no assessments. RN 1 confirmed that the record did not show reassessments of the patient's pain after her initial assessment. RN 1 stated that she made a few entries as documented because she noticed there were no other entries as she checked on the patient. RN 1 stated that she was not the nurse that discharged    the patient home. Apparently she did not sign-out of the computer system and RN 3, who actually discharged    Patient 1, documented discharge notes under RN 1's name, and afterwards noted that those entries were her (Patient 1's discharge notes at 11:27-11:30 a.m.). RN 1 stated that she did not see if Patient 1's condition changed upon discharge.

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) Policy and Procedure (P&P) titled ""Assessment of adult and pediatric patients"" (rev 7/12) indicated the purpose was to provide guidelines for ED nurses to initiate timely, accurate and ongoing assessment of physical and psychological problems of adult and pediatric patients within ED. ""Assessment provides a data base for analysis of the nature and severity of illness or injury and the need for intervention."" The policy in part indicated that ""Patient assessments will be conducted using Universal Standards of Care formulated by this department in addition to standards of care specific to the patient's complaint"" and ""Nursing care is based upon the assessment and evaluation of the patient."" The Procedure section indicated, to ""1. Obtain data by history taking, physical examination, review of records, and family interview, if appropriate. 2. Record significant data in the patient's medical record: a. Initial assessment and reassessments; b. Nursing evaluations; c. Nursing interventions performed; d. Patient's response to, and the outcome of the care provided; e. Ability of the patient and /or significant other to manage continuing care needs.""  

Review of the ED policy titled ""Triage"" (rev 7/12) in part indicated that ""severe acute pain"" was one of the conditions declared to be emergency conditions ""by statue and regulation."" The policy was not specific as to pain assessments and treatment.

Review of the ER  ""Physician Clinical Report"" electronically signed by the ER  physician MD 1 on 8/20/12 at 6:05 p.m., showed the following:

Patient 1 arrived by private vehicle, historian -patient 

History of present illness section indicated ""Dizziness"" and ""Vertigo"" started several months and still present described as mild and nausea; no vomiting or hearing loss. In section ""recent medical care"" the physician noted: ""The patient was seen recently in the office.""
Review of systems showed the patient had weakness and experienced syncope, otherwise no positive findings. 

The physician documented that ""The nursing notes have been reviewed."" The physician did not document that the patient arrived by an ambulance after possible seizure with fall in a shower, as per ambulance crew documentation and nursing notes.
 
In section ""Physical Exam"" MD 1 documented that Patient 1 appeared alert and ""in moderate distress."" The physician documented the physical exam findings were normal for all systems, including ""Normal Inspection"" for ""Back.""

Review of diagnostic tests showed that blood tests and EKG were performed. No other diagnostic tests were documented ordered or performed (such as x-ray). The physician did not document that the patient had bruising and did not address pain as documented on presentation by nurses.

MD 1 documented in the ""Clinical Impression"" section: ""Dizziness. Vertigo"" and in under ""Instructions"" noted: ""take meclizine three times per day. Rest, avoid stairs and heights as your balance wont be too good. dont drive until you are well.""   

There was no documented assessment of Patient 1 by the physician prior to discharge.

Review of the hospital Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011) in part indicated the following in section I. Emergency Services: ""The active medical staff shall have overall responsibility for emergency medical care."" Section I item 2 indicated: ""An appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency services. This record shall be incorporated in the patient's medical record chart. The record shall include: a. Adequate patient identification; b. Information concerning the time of patient's arrival and means of arrival; c. Pertinent history of the injury or illness including details relative to first aid or emergency care given the patient prior to his arrival at the hospital; d. Description of significant clinical, laboratory, and roentgenologic findings; e. Diagnosis; f. Treatment given; g. Condition of patient on discharge and transfer; h. Final disposition, including instructions given to the patient and/or family, relative to the necessary follow-up care.""

In an on-site interview with MD 1 on 4/10/13 starting at 11:15 a.m., MD 1 stated that he also served as the Emergency Department (ED) Medical Director. MD 1 stated that he did not recall Patient 1 but was familiar with the case, because care for Patient 1 was reviewed by the quality and peer review as a result of family complaint. MD 1 stated that when he saw the patient he did not have an access to the ambulance report. MD 1 stated that at time of seeing the patient he was not aware of the pre-hospital seizure episode. He reviewed nursing notes and primarily obtained history from the patient. The physician stated that he depended largely on the information obtained from the nurse (RN 1) and he was not made aware of the pre-hospital history as documented by the ambulance crew. The patient told him that she fell    because she was dizzy. The patient had a history of vertigo so the physician treated the patient for vertigo and nausea. Apparently the patient did not complain of pain during his evaluation. The physician admitted     that he did not see the bruising on the patient's back because he did not perform thorough physical examination of the back, even though the presenting chief complaint documented was back pain.  The physician claimed that upon discharge Patient 1 was better; however the assessment upon discharge was not documented. 

In a telephone interview on 2/6/13 at 3 p.m. Patient 1's husband stated that on 8/17/12 in the morning Patient 1 experienced seizure in the shower (fell    and lost consciousness). He called an ambulance and followed the ambulance to Hospital 1's ER. The husband stated that in the short time it took him to park his car and enter the ER, he found Patient 1 in a treatment room apparently already seen by the ED physician. While he was in the room, the ED physician came back into the room and talked with the husband (Patient 1 was slow to respond and confused). The husband stated that he told the physician that his wife had a seizure, fell    and lost consciousness, however the physician told him, he was wrong, that his wife got dizzy and fell   . The husband did not believe that the physician evaluated Patient 1 in the ED. He was only away from his wife a short time parking the car. Patient 1 had significant bruising to her back (described as purple-black) and bit her tongue, none of which were addressed. The husband stated that after receiving the discharge papers, he took Patient 1 into the car, at which time he now knows the patient had another seizure (locked up muscles, not making sense). The husband called Patient 1's primary care physician who instructed him to take the patient to a hospital's ED, preferably other than Hospital 1, since she already went there. The husband drove Patient 1 directly to the ED of Hospital 2, where after a long wait initially, Patient 1 received care and treatment and was diagnosed    with seizures and six fractured vertebrae. The husband stated that during the car trip to Hospital 2 Patient 1 possibly had another seizure. Per husband, Patient 1 had no recollection of detailed events until the day after admission to Hospital 2. 

Review of Hospital 2's ER  record showed that on 8/17/12 and was triaged at 1:47 p.m. The ED initial note by Hospital 2 ED physician on 8/17/12 at 5:45 p.m. showed Patient 1's chief complaint as ""Seizure Resolved"". The ED physician documented that history was obtained from the patient and the spouse, reporting, that at 7 a.m. Patient 1 woke up with vertigo and nausea, walked to the bathroom and fell    in the shower. The husband heard a loud noise, ran to the bathroom and found Patient 1 lying in the tub with her neck on the side of the tub, unresponsive, jerking of arms and legs and part of her tongue sticking out of her mouth. It was noted that Patient 1 presented to Hospital 1, was told she had vertigo and was discharged    with meclizine. The review of systems noted findings positive for neck pain, nausea, back pain, loss of consciousness and headache, and confusion. The Patient had radiological (CT scan) testing performed showing spine fractures (C7, T11, T 12 and L1-no spinal cord injuries documented). Neurology and trauma surgery consultation were obtained and Patient 1 was admitted     to Hospital 2 for treatment. 

In an interview on 4/12/13 starting at 10 a.m. the Quality Director stated, that the hospital received a complaint from the family and investigated care provided for Patient 1. Peer review was performed as a part of the quality of care review and opportunities for improvements were identified. The Quality Director stated that during their investigation the hospital learned that after discharge from the ER  Patient 1 went to Hospital 2's ER  on 8/17/12, where the patient was diagnosed    with new onset seizures, spinal fractures, and was admitted     there for treatment.

2. Patient 9 did not receive MSE by qualified medical practitioner (QMP) upon presenting to the hospital for psychiatric emergency medical condition (EMC). The Labor and Delivery (L&D) registered nurse (RN) performing a MSE for patients presenting to L&D unit failed to evaluate Patient 9' presenting complaint of psychiatric problem.

Review of the Hospital Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011), indicated in Section ""I"" titled ""Emergency Services"" that the medical staff shall develop, for approval by the governing body, a Policy and Procedure (P&P) Manual outlining the coverage in the emergency area. ""The active medical staff shall have overall responsibility for emergency medical care."" 

The Medical Staff Rules and Regulations further indicated, that an appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency service. The record shall include information concerning the means of patient's arrival, pertinent history of the injury or illness including details relative to first aid or emergency care given (to) the patient prior to his arrival at the hospital, diagnosis, treatment given, condition of patient and final disposition.  

The review of the Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws (dated November 2011) and the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011) showed no definition or indication as to who was qualified (which category of medical providers) in the hospital to perform a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) for unscheduled patients presenting to the hospital with potential Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) as defined by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). 

?	First hospital visit for Patient 9:

Review of the ""Obstetric (OB) Central Log"" showed that Patient 9 presented to the Family Birth Center, Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit on 9/20/12 at 3:20 p.m. for ""Psych eval /r/o labor"" (psychological/psychiatric evaluation/rule out labor) as documented in the section titled ""Nature of Complaint/Reason for Procedure."" The patient's disposition was documented that Patient 9 was sent to the emergency room    (ER) on 9/20/12 at 5:15 p.m. The ""transport"" section documented that the patient ""eloped.""  

According to the OB log Patient 9 remained in the L&D unit for nearly 2 hours before being sent to the ER  for evaluation of the presenting psychiatric complaint.

Review of the P&P titled ""Psychiatric Behavioral Assessment Documentation"" (revised 9/09) indicated, ""All patients that present to the ED with a primary diagnosis of behavioral, emotional, suicidal, or homicidal ideations will have a Behavioral Assessment Tool completed"" and ""when a patient admitted     for other diagnosis is identified as a risk to self or others, a Behavioral Assessment Tool will be completed."" The policy also indicated that ""Law enforcement will be notified to provide security for staff, physicians, and patients. The physician will write an order for Mental Health Consultation. A Medical Screening Exam shall be performed in the ED.

The ""ED Psychiatric Protocol -Assessment Tool"" attached to the policy indicated that patients presenting with complaints including those of wanting to die/kill self, violent behavior toward self or others, psychotic, or bizarre behaviors, met triage level 1 or 2 (three triage levels per the tool). The tool listed interventions, which should be implemented for each level. For levels 1 and 2 interventions included patient placement in the room, clothing and belongings removed, and physician notification of patient arrival. For patients with triage level 1 (per the tool all suicidal patients, agitated patient, potential danger to self or others or paranoid patients) patients should have 15 minutes checks initiated and continued until discharge, the physician should be notified of patient immediately and call for Mental Health consult should be done. 

Review of the OB triage record for Patient 9 corresponding with the entry in the ""Obstetric Central Log"" showing that Patient 9 presented to the L&D Department on 9/20/12 at 3:20 p.m. for psychiatric complaint showed, that a L&D registered nurse (RN) who performed the Medical Screening Exam (MSE) did not document the presenting psychiatric complaint. The L&D RN documented in the ""OB triage"" electronic notes at 3:22 p.m., that Patient 9 arrived by wheelchair at 3 p.m. brought in by the local police department (PD 1) and by a community mental health counselor (no name) and that Patient 9 was 38.5 weeks pregnant. The record showed that Patient 9 remained in the L&D for nearly 2 hours while being evaluated for her pregnancy status to rule out labor, which was not the presenting complaint. The record showed the patient was not in labor. At 4:35 p.m. the L&D nurse documented that Patient 9 ""talks to self, act hostile at times."" At 4:50 p.m. the nurse documented that Patient 9 was very anxious and wanted to go to a different hospital. At 5 p.m. a nursing note indicated that ""(name of PD 1) notified to escort pt (patient) to ER  for further evaluation.""

At 5:15 p.m. the OB triage nursing notes documented ""Pt suddenly decides 'Im leaving', pushes her way out of the labor room. She was not yet restrained, due to her violent attitude. She went to ER  (emergency room   ) followed by the Hosp. (Hospital 1) Security guard who was pushing her belongings in a wheelchair. She had obtained her keys, and left in her car. (Name of PD 1) never showed up. Pt left, 'eloped' AMA (against medical advice).""

Review of the Family Birth Center Policies and Procedure (P&P) Manual showed a policy titled ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE)"" (dated 7/09) indicating, ""The purpose of this policy is to describe and comply with the requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act ('EMTALA'). Under this law all individuals who come to the Medical Center with an emergency medical condition must receive an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capability of the Medical Center, to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists. If an emergency medical condition exists, the patient must receive treatment within the Medical Center's capabilities until the patient is stable for transfer or discharge, regardless of the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. The emergency needs of the patient will be met according to acceptable standards of medical practice.""  

The MSE P&P required that the L&D RN performing MSEs notified LIP (a Licensed Independent Practitioner) immediately upon recognition of emergent condition and upon completion of the initial assessment (within 90 minutes) and the LIP must see any patient for which the RN requests a LIP consultation. 

Patient 9's OB triage record showed no documentation that a LIP came to evaluate the patient during the 2 hours the patient spent in the L&D unit, prior to eloping. Review of orders showed a telephone order on 9/20/12 at 3:30 p.m. from a Certified Nurse Midwife for evaluation for labor and a second telephone order from the OB physician (MD 4) on 9/20/12 at 4:15 p.m. to send patient for further evaluation to ER.  

In Patient 9's OB triage record on 9/20/12, there was no documentation of evaluation of Patient 9's mental condition per policies. There were no notes related to the events leading to the patient's arrival to the hospital, the reason why the patient was escorted by a mental health staff and a police officer, or any notes explaining why the patient needed psychiatric evaluation. The record contained no documentation that a qualified medical practitioner (QMP) was immediately notified and evaluated Patient 9's presenting psychological/psychiatric complaint, to determine if an emergency medical condition existed. The record showed no documentation that the physician was notified immediately and a call for Mental Health consult was done. 

In a collaborative interview with the L&D Manager, ED Manager, QA Director and OB physician, MD 4) on 4/11/13 starting at 1 p.m. the interviewed staff stated the following information:
Patient 9 was brought in to the L&D unit by the local police (PD 1) and by a mental community health worker (MH 1, not known to the hospital staff) who requested that Patient 9's pregnancy be induced due to the patient having psychiatric issues posing danger to self and others (her unborn child). The OB physician, MD 4, stated that he provided prenatal care for the patient on outpatient basis. The patient lived with her grandmother. Patient 9 had a history of bipolar disorder and her condition was stable until recently when her psychological condition deteriorated and she was placed on psychotropic medications. MD 4 stated that Patient 9 ceased taking her medications and became psychotic, reportedly attacked her grandmother and was thrown out to streets by her grandmother. The MD stated that as a result, Patient 9 became homeless. The staff was not clear how the mental health worker, who brought Patient 9 into the L&D with the PD, was involved, or what were her qualifications. The staff speculated that Patient 9 presented to a mental clinic for an appointment and was found having psychotic behaviors. The mental worker was not known to the staff and not available for interview to collaborate any of the information. The interviewed staff stated that they had no written record of what happened before Patient 9 was brought to the L&D, other than Patient 9 had psychiatric problems and a request was made to have her pregnancy induced for the safety of the unborn child from the mother. 

There was no documentation in the ED records reviewed for Patient 9 during survey as to what the mental health worker or the PD staff reported to the L&D nurse upon arrival.

The L&D Manager confirmed in the interview on 4/11/13 at 1 p.m. that although Patient 9 presented to the L&D escorted by the mental health and PD with a primary psychiatric complaint, the OB triage nurse did not assess the patient's mental status, instead proceeded with checking the patient's pregnancy status (uterus and fetal monitoring) to evaluate if the patient was in labor, which was not the presenting complaint. The Manager confirmed that a physician was not notified immediately of the patient's presenting psychiatric (non-OB) complaint and a physician did not evaluate the patient's mental status. The Mental Health consult was not initiated. The L&D Manager stated that notifying ED about any patients presenting to the OB was not the practice. Per L&D MSE policy, OB physicians were notified for all patients, within 90 minutes of their arrival, or sooner if in labor or with pregnancy related complications. 

The L&D Manager stated during the above interview, that sometime during the patient's evaluation of pregnancy status (uterus and fetal monitoring) the local police (PD 1) left the hospital. The L&D Manager confirmed there was no documentation as to when and why the police left. It was unclear if the mental health person stayed with the patient. The L&D staff later called PD 1 to return to the ED because of Patient 9's mental status and the patient needed to be transported to ED for psychiatric evaluation; however PD 1 did not show up. The L&D staff proceeded to take Patient 9 to the ED for psychiatric evaluation via a wheelchair, after the OB check was completed. As Patient 9 was escorted to the ED in a wheelchair by in-house security, Patient 9 pushed away, retrieved her belongings and car keys from the wheelchair and left the facility. The staff stated that in-house security had hands-off policy and was not authorized to detain patients. 

The Department obtained a report on 4/15/13 from the PD 1 to evaluate/collaborate the events prior to Patient 9's presentation to the hospital. The provided PD 1 case report of the events for 9/20/12 documented the following:

9/20/12 at 1:30 p.m.-PD received information from the County Behavioral Health that Patient 9 was being sought for a 5150 (involuntary) W&I (Welfare and Institution) detention. Patient 9 was noted with a full term pregnancy and there was a concern that the baby' life was at risk from being harmed by Patient 9. It was noted that a mental health staff felt it was necessary to have medical staff induce labor, so the baby would be free from potential harm from Patient 9.

9/20/12 at 2:10 p.m. - Patient 9 presented to the lobby at PD 1 and was detained until a representative from mental health arrived (MH 1) with a plan to transport Patient 9 to Hospital 1. It was noted that while MH 1 was escorting Patient 9, the patient fled from MH 1 and drove away recklessly, with MH 1 following and calling 911.

9/20/12 at 2:32 p.m.- an officer was dispatched to the outpatient services entrance at the Hospital (1) to assist MH 1 with an unknown problem. Upon arrival the officer was met by MH 1 and a hospital's security officer and was informed by MH 1 that Patient 9 was uncooperative again and possibly threat to others. MH 1 communicated with the hospital staff in effort to expedite Patient 9's admittance (per the report).

It was noted that eventually, a doctor from OB Department came out to the lobby and spoke with Patient 9, and decided to take the patient directly to the Family Birth Center. The police staff escorted Patient 9 to room 234. The officer noted that ""it was","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on staff interview, Emergency Department (ED) record review,  policy and procedure (P&P) and other document review, the hospital failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination conducted by an individual (s) who was determined qualified by hospital bylaws, or rules and regulations, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) existed, for 7 of 20 ED patients reviewed (Patients 1, 9, 11, 13, 18, 19 and 20), as evidenced by: 

1. The emergency room    physician, MD 1, failed to perform appropriate assessments and provide care based on that assessment for Patient 1. 

2. Patient 9 did not receive MSE by qualified medical practitioner (QMP) upon presenting to the hospital for psychiatric emergency medical condition (EMC). The Labor and Delivery (L&D) registered nurse (RN) performing a MSE for patients presenting to L&D unit failed to evaluate Patient 9' presenting complaint of psychiatric problem.

3. The hospital failed to implement the hospital's policies for Triaging patients for patients 11, 13, 18, 19 and 20.

Findings:

1. The emergency room    physician, MD 1, failed to perform appropriate assessments and provide care based on that assessment for Patient 1.

Review of emergency room    (ER) medical record on 4/10/13 showed that on 8/17/12 Patient 1 was brought to the ER  on 8/17/12 at 8:55 a.m. by ambulance. The ambulance record showed that the ambulance was called for complaint of ""convulsions/seizures"". The ambulance documentation showed the following: upon arrival at site Patient 1, a [AGE] years old female, was found alert and oriented times two, being taken out of shower by her husband and paramedics secondary to seizure-like activity. Per husband's report, Patient 1 was experiencing vertigo, felt hot and decided to take a shower to cool-off. The husband reported hearing ""thud"" and found his wife in the shower in ""the decorticate posture"" and unresponsive. (Decorticate posture is an abnormal posturing in which a person is stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight). The husband reported no seizures history for Patient 1 and no recent trauma. The ambulance documentation showed that by the time of arrival to the ER  Patient 1 was alert and oriented times four and was complaining of pain in the right side of her back resulting from the fall in the shower. Ambulance staff documented, that Patient 1 had a bruising of mid-right side of her back.  The section ""impression"" noted ""Change in Responsiveness"" and ""Seizure, Diabetic symptoms.""  The ambulance notes documented that report was called to the hospital ER  via Radio at 8:43 a.m.

The ER  triage notes on 8/17/12 showed the following documentation in Patient 1 ER  record:

Triage time 8:59 a.m. by Registered Nurse (RN) 1 
Chief complaint: back pain
Vital signs: Blood Pressure (B/P) 106/65; Heart rate (HR) 73; Respiratory Rate (RR) 16 and Temperature (T) 96 auxiliary (armpit)

Emesis noted. Has vomited several times. Abdomen soft.  Bowel sound within normal limits. Soft tissue tenderness. Capillary refill less than 2 seconds and is greater than 2 seconds. Sensation intact in extremities. ROM (range of motion) within normal limits.""

Nursing Progress note by RN 1 at 9:23 a.m. indicated that at 8:58 a.m. Patient 1 was gowned, placed on a monitor and ready for evaluation ""chart flagged.""  
At 9:45 a.m. RN 1 documented that the husband was at the patient's bedside.

At 10:09 a.m. another RN (RN 2) documented the following medications were administered to Patient 1:
Ativan (antianxiety medication) 1 mg (milligrams) PO (by mouth)
Meclizine (medication for dizziness) 2 mg PO
Zofran (medication for nausea) 4 mg diluted with NS (Normal Saline) slow IVP (injected into blood vessel via intravenous catheter) 
RN 2 noted that medications were for anxiety and nausea. 

Review of Physician orders showed the above medications along with orders for blood work and EKG were documented by the ER  physician (MD 1) at 10:05 a.m.

RN 2 documented the following vital signs at 10:13 a.m.: BP 122/80; HR 80; RR 16; Oxygen Saturation on room air 96 percent. 

Next entries were related to the patient discharge at 11:27-11:30 a.m. documented under the name of RN 1, with a note by RN 3 below those entries, that RN 3 in fact documented the discharge entries. The discharge entries included information that IV was discontinued, fall risk assessments was completed and no fall risk identified, discharge instructions provided and reviewed with the patient and the patient verbalized understanding. The patient was noted discharged    home accompanied by spouse. Vital signs at 11:30 a.m. were documented: BP 135/86; HR 66; RR 22; Oxygen Saturation on room air 96 percent. The nurse documented that Patient 1's condition at departure was unchanged.

Review of the ER  nursing notes showed no pain treatment and no pain reassessment after initial pain was documented 8/10 in triage. No evaluation of effectiveness of medications administered for vertigo, anxiety and nausea to Patient 1 by RN 2 was documented. 

In an interview on 4/12/13 at 12:25 p.m. RN 3 stated that typically she was scheduled and arrived in the ED to start her shift at 10:30 -11 a.m. with providing breaks to other nursing staff.  After reviewing Patient 1's ED record, RN 3 confirmed that she discharged    Patient 1 as noted above, that if the physician discharged    the patient she would so note. RN 3 confirmed that she did not perform assessment of the patient's condition, including pain level, prior to discharge.

In an on-site interview on 4/12/13 at 11:50 a.m. RN 2 confirmed that he answered the radio call from the ambulance alerting the ER  that the ambulance was bringing Patient 1 to the ER  in 10 minutes as indicated in a document titled ""Regional Base Hospital Form"" signed by RN 2. RN 2 confirmed he documented on the Form that Patient 1's chief complaint was seizure activity, fall, and postictal (altered state of consciousness that a person enters after experiencing a seizure). RN 2 stated that he did not recall Patient 1, but per record review he administered medications to Patient 1 as documented above. RN 2 admitted     that he did not evaluate the effectiveness of the medications and the response of Patient 1 to the medications administered. RN 2 stated that he was not assigned to Patient 1, that he was only helping RN 1 with the patient care. RN 2 confirmed that there was no nursing assessment related to the medications administered. RN 2 also acknowledged that the ER  record showed no documentation that Patient 1's pain was re-assessed during the ER  stay, after the initial pain scale showed 8/10 pain (severe pain). RN 2 stated that normally a primary ED nurse would perform ongoing assessments, but probably no primary ED RN was assigned to the patient because one staff called off sick and the ED was short of staff that morning.

In an interview on 4/12/13 at 11:50 a.m. the ED Manager confirmed that no primary nurse was assigned to Patient 1 for the ED visit on 8/17/12 due to staff calling off sick, per staffing sheets review.

In an on-site interview on 4/10/13 at 3:25 p.m. RN 1 stated that she remembered Patient 1. RN 1 was the triage nurse as well as the charge nurse. RN 1 believed that RN 2 was assigned to the patient as the primary ED nurse. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 was the first of three ambulances arriving within 10 minutes. RN 1 recalled that ambulance medic reported that the initial call for Patient 1 was for seizures. Upon arrival the ambulance medic reported fall, loss of consciousness and possible syncopal episode, and back pain. RN 1 stated it was a verbal report and that the medic's documentation usually came later, after it was downloaded to the computer system, so the ER  staff probably did not have access to the written report initially. RN 1 quickly triaged Patient 1 and went to greet the other two ambulances. RN 1 stated that she documented the initial assessment, pain 8/10, and bruising to the patient back. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 arrived on gurney positioned on her stomach for comfort, because of her back pain. The patient's speech was slightly slurred. RN 1 admitted     she knew the ambulance call was for seizures but did not document the reported information about the pre-hospital care for Patient 1, only that the patient arrived via EMS.  RN 1 stated that the expectation was for the primary ER  nurse to perform a complete assessment and document. RN 1 recalled that Patient 1 was taken directly to a treatment room and the physician (MD 1) came to the treatment room while the ambulance medics were giving verbal report on Patient 1.

In reviewing the ER  record RN 1 confirmed that there was no documentation of other RNs checking on Patient 1 (evaluating and assessing the patient). RN 2 only documented medications administered and no assessments. RN 1 confirmed that the record did not show reassessments of the patient's pain after her initial assessment. RN 1 stated that she made a few entries as documented because she noticed there were no other entries as she checked on the patient. RN 1 stated that she was not the nurse that discharged    the patient home. Apparently she did not sign-out of the computer system and RN 3, who actually discharged    Patient 1, documented discharge notes under RN 1's name, and afterwards noted that those entries were her (Patient 1's discharge notes at 11:27-11:30 a.m.). RN 1 stated that she did not see if Patient 1's condition changed upon discharge.

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) Policy and Procedure (P&P) titled ""Assessment of adult and pediatric patients"" (rev 7/12) indicated the purpose was to provide guidelines for ED nurses to initiate timely, accurate and ongoing assessment of physical and psychological problems of adult and pediatric patients within ED. ""Assessment provides a data base for analysis of the nature and severity of illness or injury and the need for intervention."" The policy in part indicated that ""Patient assessments will be conducted using Universal Standards of Care formulated by this department in addition to standards of care specific to the patient's complaint"" and ""Nursing care is based upon the assessment and evaluation of the patient."" The Procedure section indicated, to ""1. Obtain data by history taking, physical examination, review of records, and family interview, if appropriate. 2. Record significant data in the patient's medical record: a. Initial assessment and reassessments; b. Nursing evaluations; c. Nursing interventions performed; d. Patient's response to, and the outcome of the care provided; e. Ability of the patient and /or significant other to manage continuing care needs.""  

Review of the ED policy titled ""Triage"" (rev 7/12) in part indicated that ""severe acute pain"" was one of the conditions declared to be emergency conditions ""by statue and regulation."" The policy was not specific as to pain assessments and treatment.

Review of the ER  ""Physician Clinical Report"" electronically signed by the ER  physician MD 1 on 8/20/12 at 6:05 p.m., showed the following:

Patient 1 arrived by private vehicle, historian -patient 

History of present illness section indicated ""Dizziness"" and ""Vertigo"" started several months and still present described as mild and nausea; no vomiting or hearing loss. In section ""recent medical care"" the physician noted: ""The patient was seen recently in the office.""
Review of systems showed the patient had weakness and experienced syncope, otherwise no positive findings. 

The physician documented that ""The nursing notes have been reviewed."" The physician did not document that the patient arrived by an ambulance after possible seizure with fall in a shower, as per ambulance crew documentation and nursing notes.
 
In section ""Physical Exam"" MD 1 documented that Patient 1 appeared alert and ""in moderate distress."" The physician documented the physical exam findings were normal for all systems, including ""Normal Inspection"" for ""Back.""

Review of diagnostic tests showed that blood tests and EKG were performed. No other diagnostic tests were documented ordered or performed (such as x-ray). The physician did not document that the patient had bruising and did not address pain as documented on presentation by nurses.

MD 1 documented in the ""Clinical Impression"" section: ""Dizziness. Vertigo"" and in under ""Instructions"" noted: ""take meclizine three times per day. Rest, avoid stairs and heights as your balance wont be too good. dont drive until you are well.""   

There was no documented assessment of Patient 1 by the physician prior to discharge.

Review of the hospital Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011) in part indicated the following in section I. Emergency Services: ""The active medical staff shall have overall responsibility for emergency medical care."" Section I item 2 indicated: ""An appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency services. This record shall be incorporated in the patient's medical record chart. The record shall include: a. Adequate patient identification; b. Information concerning the time of patient's arrival and means of arrival; c. Pertinent history of the injury or illness including details relative to first aid or emergency care given the patient prior to his arrival at the hospital; d. Description of significant clinical, laboratory, and roentgenologic findings; e. Diagnosis; f. Treatment given; g. Condition of patient on discharge and transfer; h. Final disposition, including instructions given to the patient and/or family, relative to the necessary follow-up care.""

In an on-site interview with MD 1 on 4/10/13 starting at 11:15 a.m., MD 1 stated that he also served as the Emergency Department (ED) Medical Director. MD 1 stated that he did not recall Patient 1 but was familiar with the case, because care for Patient 1 was reviewed by the quality and peer review as a result of family complaint. MD 1 stated that when he saw the patient he did not have an access to the ambulance report. MD 1 stated that at time of seeing the patient he was not aware of the pre-hospital seizure episode. He reviewed nursing notes and primarily obtained history from the patient. The physician stated that he depended largely on the information obtained from the nurse (RN 1) and he was not made aware of the pre-hospital history as documented by the ambulance crew. The patient told him that she fell    because she was dizzy. The patient had a history of vertigo so the physician treated the patient for vertigo and nausea. Apparently the patient did not complain of pain during his evaluation. The physician admitted     that he did not see the bruising on the patient's back because he did not perform thorough physical examination of the back, even though the presenting chief complaint documented was back pain.  The physician claimed that upon discharge Patient 1 was better; however the assessment upon discharge was not documented. 

In a telephone interview on 2/6/13 at 3 p.m. Patient 1's husband stated that on 8/17/12 in the morning Patient 1 experienced seizure in the shower (fell    and lost consciousness). He called an ambulance and followed the ambulance to Hospital 1's ER. The husband stated that in the short time it took him to park his car and enter the ER, he found Patient 1 in a treatment room apparently already seen by the ED physician. While he was in the room, the ED physician came back into the room and talked with the husband (Patient 1 was slow to respond and confused). The husband stated that he told the physician that his wife had a seizure, fell    and lost consciousness, however the physician told him, he was wrong, that his wife got dizzy and fell   . The husband did not believe that the physician evaluated Patient 1 in the ED. He was only away from his wife a short time parking the car. Patient 1 had significant bruising to her back (described as purple-black) and bit her tongue, none of which were addressed. The husband stated that after receiving the discharge papers, he took Patient 1 into the car, at which time he now knows the patient had another seizure (locked up muscles, not making sense). The husband called Patient 1's primary care physician who instructed him to take the patient to a hospital's ED, preferably other than Hospital 1, since she already went there. The husband drove Patient 1 directly to the ED of Hospital 2, where after a long wait initially, Patient 1 received care and treatment and was diagnosed    with seizures and six fractured vertebrae. The husband stated that during the car trip to Hospital 2 Patient 1 possibly had another seizure. Per husband, Patient 1 had no recollection of detailed events until the day after admission to Hospital 2. 

Review of Hospital 2's ER  record showed that on 8/17/12 and was triaged at 1:47 p.m. The ED initial note by Hospital 2 ED physician on 8/17/12 at 5:45 p.m. showed Patient 1's chief complaint as ""Seizure Resolved"". The ED physician documented that history was obtained from the patient and the spouse, reporting, that at 7 a.m. Patient 1 woke up with vertigo and nausea, walked to the bathroom and fell    in the shower. The husband heard a loud noise, ran to the bathroom and found Patient 1 lying in the tub with her neck on the side of the tub, unresponsive, jerking of arms and legs and part of her tongue sticking out of her mouth. It was noted that Patient 1 presented to Hospital 1, was told she had vertigo and was discharged    with meclizine. The review of systems noted findings positive for neck pain, nausea, back pain, loss of consciousness and headache, and confusion. The Patient had radiological (CT scan) testing performed showing spine fractures (C7, T11, T 12 and L1-no spinal cord injuries documented). Neurology and trauma surgery consultation were obtained and Patient 1 was admitted     to Hospital 2 for treatment. 

In an interview on 4/12/13 starting at 10 a.m. the Quality Director stated, that the hospital received a complaint from the family and investigated care provided for Patient 1. Peer review was performed as a part of the quality of care review and opportunities for improvements were identified. The Quality Director stated that during their investigation the hospital learned that after discharge from the ER  Patient 1 went to Hospital 2's ER  on 8/17/12, where the patient was diagnosed    with new onset seizures, spinal fractures, and was admitted     there for treatment.

2. Patient 9 did not receive MSE by qualified medical practitioner (QMP) upon presenting to the hospital for psychiatric emergency medical condition (EMC). The Labor and Delivery (L&D) registered nurse (RN) performing a MSE for patients presenting to L&D unit failed to evaluate Patient 9' presenting complaint of psychiatric problem.

Review of the Hospital Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011), indicated in Section ""I"" titled ""Emergency Services"" that the medical staff shall develop, for approval by the governing body, a Policy and Procedure (P&P) Manual outlining the coverage in the emergency area. ""The active medical staff shall have overall responsibility for emergency medical care."" 

The Medical Staff Rules and Regulations further indicated, that an appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency service. The record shall include information concerning the means of patient's arrival, pertinent history of the injury or illness including details relative to first aid or emergency care given (to) the patient prior to his arrival at the hospital, diagnosis, treatment given, condition of patient and final disposition.  

The review of the Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws (dated November 2011) and the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations (revised February 28, 2011) showed no definition or indication as to who was qualified (which category of medical providers) in the hospital to perform a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) for unscheduled patients presenting to the hospital with potential Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) as defined by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). 

?	First hospital visit for Patient 9:

Review of the ""Obstetric (OB) Central Log"" showed that Patient 9 presented to the Family Birth Center, Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit on 9/20/12 at 3:20 p.m. for ""Psych eval /r/o labor"" (psychological/psychiatric evaluation/rule out labor) as documented in the section titled ""Nature of Complaint/Reason for Procedure."" The patient's disposition was documented that Patient 9 was sent to the emergency room    (ER) on 9/20/12 at 5:15 p.m. The ""transport"" section documented that the patient ""eloped.""  

According to the OB log Patient 9 remained in the L&D unit for nearly 2 hours before being sent to the ER  for evaluation of the presenting psychiatric complaint.

Review of the P&P titled ""Psychiatric Behavioral Assessment Documentation"" (revised 9/09) indicated, ""All patients that present to the ED with a primary diagnosis of behavioral, emotional, suicidal, or homicidal ideations will have a Behavioral Assessment Tool completed"" and ""when a patient admitted     for other diagnosis is identified as a risk to self or others, a Behavioral Assessment Tool will be completed."" The policy also indicated that ""Law enforcement will be notified to provide security for staff, physicians, and patients. The physician will write an order for Mental Health Consultation. A Medical Screening Exam shall be performed in the ED.

The ""ED Psychiatric Protocol -Assessment Tool"" attached to the policy indicated that patients presenting with complaints including those of wanting to die/kill self, violent behavior toward self or others, psychotic, or bizarre behaviors, met triage level 1 or 2 (three triage levels per the tool). The tool listed interventions, which should be implemented for each level. For levels 1 and 2 interventions included patient placement in the room, clothing and belongings removed, and physician notification of patient arrival. For patients with triage level 1 (per the tool all suicidal patients, agitated patient, potential danger to self or others or paranoid patients) patients should have 15 minutes checks initiated and continued until discharge, the physician should be notified of patient immediately and call for Mental Health consult should be done. 

Review of the OB triage record for Patient 9 corresponding with the entry in the ""Obstetric Central Log"" showing that Patient 9 presented to the L&D Department on 9/20/12 at 3:20 p.m. for psychiatric complaint showed, that a L&D registered nurse (RN) who performed the Medical Screening Exam (MSE) did not document the presenting psychiatric complaint. The L&D RN documented in the ""OB triage"" electronic notes at 3:22 p.m., that Patient 9 arrived by wheelchair at 3 p.m. brought in by the local police department (PD 1) and by a community mental health counselor (no name) and that Patient 9 was 38.5 weeks pregnant. The record showed that Patient 9 remained in the L&D for nearly 2 hours while being evaluated for her pregnancy status to rule out labor, which was not the presenting complaint. The record showed the patient was not in labor. At 4:35 p.m. the L&D nurse documented that Patient 9 ""talks to self, act hostile at times."" At 4:50 p.m. the nurse documented that Patient 9 was very anxious and wanted to go to a different hospital. At 5 p.m. a nursing note indicated that ""(name of PD 1) notified to escort pt (patient) to ER  for further evaluation.""

At 5:15 p.m. the OB triage nursing notes documented ""Pt suddenly decides 'Im leaving', pushes her way out of the labor room. She was not yet restrained, due to her violent attitude. She went to ER  (emergency room   ) followed by the Hosp. (Hospital 1) Security guard who was pushing her belongings in a wheelchair. She had obtained her keys, and left in her car. (Name of PD 1) never showed up. Pt left, 'eloped' AMA (against medical advice).""

Review of the Family Birth Center Policies and Procedure (P&P) Manual showed a policy titled ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE)"" (dated 7/09) indicating, ""The purpose of this policy is to describe and comply with the requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act ('EMTALA'). Under this law all individuals who come to the Medical Center with an emergency medical condition must receive an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capability of the Medical Center, to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists. If an emergency medical condition exists, the patient must receive treatment within the Medical Center's capabilities until the patient is stable for transfer or discharge, regardless of the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. The emergency needs of the patient will be met according to acceptable standards of medical practice.""  

The MSE P&P required that the L&D RN performing MSEs notified LIP (a Licensed Independent Practitioner) immediately upon recognition of emergent condition and upon completion of the initial assessment (within 90 minutes) and the LIP must see any patient for which the RN requests a LIP consultation. 

Patient 9's OB triage record showed no documentation that a LIP came to evaluate the patient during the 2 hours the patient spent in the L&D unit, prior to eloping. Review of orders showed a telephone order on 9/20/12 at 3:30 p.m. from a Certified Nurse Midwife for evaluation for labor and a second telephone order from the OB physician (MD 4) on 9/20/12 at 4:15 p.m. to send patient for further evaluation to ER.  

In Patient 9's OB triage record on 9/20/12, there was no documentation of evaluation of Patient 9's mental condition per policies. There were no notes related to the events leading to the patient's arrival to the hospital, the reason why the patient was escorted by a mental health staff and a police officer, or any notes explaining why the patient needed psychiatric evaluation. The record contained no documentation that a qualified medical practitioner (QMP) was immediately notified and evaluated Patient 9's presenting psychological/psychiatric complaint, to determine if an emergency medical condition existed. The record showed no documentation that the physician was notified immediately and a call for Mental Health consult was done. 

In a collaborative interview with the L&D Manager, ED Manager, QA Director and OB physician, MD 4) on 4/11/13 starting at 1 p.m. the interviewed staff stated the following information:
Patient 9 was brought in to the L&D unit by the local police (PD 1) and by a mental community health worker (MH 1, not known to the hospital staff) who requested that Patient 9's pregnancy be induced due to the patient having psychiatric issues posing danger to self and others (her unborn child). The OB physician, MD 4, stated that he provided prenatal care for the patient on outpatient basis. The patient lived with her grandmother. Patient 9 had a history of bipolar disorder and her condition was stable until recently when her psychological condition deteriorated and she was placed on psychotropic medications. MD 4 stated that Patient 9 ceased taking her medications and became psychotic, reportedly attacked her grandmother and was thrown out to streets by her grandmother. The MD stated that as a result, Patient 9 became homeless. The staff was not clear how the mental health worker, who brought Patient 9 into the L&D with the PD, was involved, or what were her qualifications. The staff speculated that Patient 9 presented to a mental clinic for an appointment and was found having psychotic behaviors. The mental worker was not known to the staff and not available for interview to collaborate any of the information. The interviewed staff stated that they had no written record of what happened before Patient 9 was brought to the L&D, other than Patient 9 had psychiatric problems and a request was made to have her pregnancy induced for the safety of the unborn child from the mother. 

There was no documentation in the ED records reviewed for Patient 9 during survey as to what the mental health worker or the PD staff reported to the L&D nurse upon arrival.

The L&D Manager confirmed in the interview on 4/11/13 at 1 p.m. that although Patient 9 presented to the L&D escorted by the mental health and PD with a primary psychiatric complaint, the OB triage nurse did not assess the patient's mental status, instead proceeded with checking the patient's pregnancy status (uterus and fetal monitoring) to evaluate if the patient was in labor, which was not the presenting complaint. The Manager confirmed that a physician was not notified immediately of the patient's presenting psychiatric (non-OB) complaint and a physician did not evaluate the patient's mental status. The Mental Health consult was not initiated. The L&D Manager stated that notifying ED about any patients presenting to the OB was not the practice. Per L&D MSE policy, OB physicians were notified for all patients, within 90 minutes of their arrival, or sooner if in labor or with pregnancy related complications. 

The L&D Manager stated during the above interview, that sometime during the patient's evaluation of pregnancy status (uterus and fetal monitoring) the local police (PD 1) left the hospital. The L&D Manager confirmed there was no documentation as to when and why the police left. It was unclear if the mental health person stayed with the patient. The L&D staff later called PD 1 to return to the ED because of Patient 9's mental status and the patient needed to be transported to ED for psychiatric evaluation; however PD 1 did not show up. The L&D staff proceeded to take Patient 9 to the ED for psychiatric evaluation via a wheelchair, after the OB check was completed. As Patient 9 was escorted to the ED in a wheelchair by in-house security, Patient 9 pushed away, retrieved her belongings and car keys from the wheelchair and left the facility. The staff stated that in-house security had hands-off policy and was not authorized to detain patients. 

The Department obtained a report on 4/15/13 from the PD 1 to evaluate/collaborate the events prior to Patient 9's presentation to the hospital. The provided PD 1 case report of the events for 9/20/12 documented the following:

9/20/12 at 1:30 p.m.-PD received information from the County Behavioral Health that Patient 9 was being sought for a 5150 (involuntary) W&I (Welfare and Institution) detention. Patient 9 was noted with a full term pregnancy and there was a concern that the baby' life was at risk from being harmed by Patient 9. It was noted that a mental health staff felt it was necessary to have medical staff induce labor, so the baby would be free from potential harm from Patient 9.

9/20/12 at 2:10 p.m. - Patient 9 presented to the lobby at PD 1 and was detained until a representative from mental health arrived (MH 1) with a plan to transport Patient 9 to Hospital 1. It was noted that while MH 1 was escorting Patient 9, the patient fled from MH 1 and drove away recklessly, with MH 1 following and calling 911.

9/20/12 at 2:32 p.m.- an officer was dispatched to the outpatient services entrance at the Hospital (1) to assist MH 1 with an unknown problem. Upon arrival the officer was met by MH 1 and a hospital's security officer and was informed by MH 1 that Patient 9 was uncooperative again and possibly threat to others. MH 1 communicated with the hospital staff in effort to expedite Patient 9's admittance (per the report).

It was noted that eventually, a doctor from OB Department came out to the lobby and spoke with Patient 9, and decided to take the patient directly to the Family Birth Center. The police staff escorted Patient 9 to room 234. The officer noted that ""it was",1411,"2406 ES3811","2013"

Based on medical record review, document review and interview, in six (6) of six (6) medical records reviewed, it was determined: 
(a) Obstetric patients did not receive a medical screening evaluation from Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP) in accordance with State regulation. Pregnant patients who presented to the Labor and Delivery unit with medical complaints and symptoms of possible labor, were assessed by labor and delivery nurses. There was no documented evidence that the nurses were designated by the hospital to perform assessments for pregnant patients for signs of labor. 
(b) The facility does not have a policy that directs the Labor and Delivery Nurses to assess patients who presented with medical complaints and complications during pregnancy.
 (c) Providers failed to document examinations and findings of pregnant patients who were having contractions. (Patient #s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).

Findings include:

Review of the facility's policy titled ""Labor Evaluation"" which was last reviewed 2/2019 states the purpose of the policy is ""patients will be referred to the Birthing Center by their provider for evaluation of labor. Patients may be evaluated in the Labor and Delivery area by a Labor and Delivery nurse.""

Review of the facility's rules and regulations and medical staff bylaws identified that Labor and Delivery Nurses were not authorized or designated as Qualified Medical Personnel to perform medical screening examinations on pregnant patients. These nurses were conducting evaluations and  assessments of pregnant patients who are in possible labor.

A Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) ordered urine tests at 6:48 PM, blood tests at 6:51 PM and Tylenol 650 mg orally for pain, which a nurse administered to the patient at 7:30 PM. The nursing staff performed a fetal non-stress test along with an external tocodynamometer (a medical device used to measure the frequency and duration of uterine contractions) reading to detect uterine contractions and there is documentation of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring by the nursing staff. The last pain assessment was documented at 7:32 PM and the patient was noted to be aching and on and off.  A nurse documented at 7:51 PM ""report given to CNM, labs, blood pressure tracing reactive and occ contraction."" The nursing staff discharged    the patient from the facility at 8:05 PM that night with instructions that included signs and symptoms of preeclampsia (a complication of pregnancy) and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.

Based on document reviews and interview, Facility A failed to provide a medical screening to 1 of 1 patients presenting in the emergency room    that was twenty four weeks pregnant with a complaint of contractions for two days.

A phone interview was conducted on 08/01/2012 at 2:15 PM with patient #1 from Facility A   confirms she was present in the emergency room    (ER) and did not receive a medical screening.  The interview revealed, ""My husband took me to Facility A's ER.  I was having contractions 5 minutes apart.  When we got to the ER, I nearly went to my knees, the contraction was so strong.  I was registering in the ER  when the Dr. and Nurse came out and told me they were not refusing to care for me but... they told me they didn't have Obstetrical (OB) services there and didn't have an OB Doctor.  They said they didn't know how soon they could get an ambulance because they did not know where they were stationed in the area.  They told me and my husband the best thing for me was to go to Facility C because they had OB services.  They didn't even help get me back to the truck.  We broke down on the side of the road and had to call 911.  The ambulance picked me up on the side of the road and took me to Facility B.""  

A review of Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) Patient Care Report revealed, ""Patient picked up: US Highway 79E. Patient found: in vehicle. Pt. presented to EMS stating that she thought she was in labor. Pt. was having contractions lasting 30 sec-1 min. They were happening about every 5 min. Pt. stated that she felt like she needed to have a bowel movement. Pt. was also having some bloody discharge. Pt. stated that the contractions had started yesterday evening. Pt. was assisted to the cot and into the truck. Pt. stated that she went to Facility A and they advised her that they couldn't do anything and she needed to just go to Facility C. Pt. stated that she had multiple contractions during the trip from Facility A to the point where EMS picked her up. Upon initial transport Facility C was contacted and the Labor and Delivery (L&D) transferred EMS to Pt's doctor. Pt's doctor told EMS to go to Facility B and she would advise the on call doctor that she was coming. Pt. continued to have multiple contractions in route and all thru transport. Pt. was transported directly to Facility B's L&D.""

Review of the operative report dated [DATE] for patient #1 from Facility B revealed,  ""CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING: This patient is a [AGE]-year-old gravida 1 (first pregnancy) who arrived complaining of uterine contractions, by ambulance. The patient had received prenatal care in Facility C. She went to the emergency room    in Facility A and was told to go by private vehicle to Facility C. Her car broke down on the way to Facility C and then got in an ambulance heading toward Facility C that then went to Facility B, per the husband. When she arrived she was 7 cm with a bulging bag of waters, baby was breech by ultrasound with stable fetal heart tones. Therefore she was taken back for a stat caesarean section.""

A review of the document titled, ""History and Physical"" form Facility B, dated 07/25/2012 and timed 6:16 AM revealed, ""HISTORY: Baby Boy is a 24-week, extremely premature infant delivered by a 28-year-old, primigravida (first pregnancy) mom. She was admitted     this morning in advanced labor with abruption. The baby was delivered by caesarian section due to breech presentation. APGAR (assessment of a newborn immediately after birth) scores were 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes. He was intubated (insertion of a breathing tube) in the delivery room and received dose of prophylactic Surfactant.""  The medical chart further revealed at approximately 4:27 PM on 07/31/2012 the baby was pronounced dead. 

An interview was held with staff #16 at Facility A on 08/03/2012 at 9:10 AM in the office across from the Administrative Conference Room with staff #3 present as a witness. Staff #16 was asked if she had knowledge of or had been made aware of a 24 week pregnant woman presenting to the ER  on 07/25/2012 in active labor and asked ER  staff for assistance.  Staff #16 stated ""no"".  Staff #16 recanted and said she was made aware of the incident this morning by ER  staff.  Staff #16 was asked if she had any knowledge of a similar type of OB incident happening in the past. Staff #16 stated ""no"".
 
At approximately 9:30 in the hallway, staff #3 reported that staff #16 had called to make a correction in her statement. The correction was that staff #16 had not been made aware of the incident this morning (08/03/2012) but had been made aware of the incident last night when a night nurse called and informed her (staff #16).

The review of an email dated 07/27/2012 and authored by staff #16 was sent to staff #14 and all ER  staff confirmed that staff #16 had knowledge of patient #1 being present in the ER. The email revealed, ""You cannot tell an OB we don't have OB services. The patient must be brought back and assessed and seen by the ER  doctor. We do have OB services in that we have a physician and a nurse. If an OB patient is told we have no OB services and leaves to go somewhere else and delivers en route or is in a car wreck you and the hospital are legally and morally responsible for the Mother and the baby.  I was told by a family member on Wednesday that we told a pregnant patient we do not have OB services and to go somewhere else. The patient headed to Facility C but her car broke down on the way. They called EMS. The baby was 3 months early and weighed barely over one pound. Whoever told her we don't have OB services could be in big trouble if the patient and her family pursue it ...even if all turns out well. That very scenario is why we have the EMTALA law and this was an EMTALA violation.  Since this is at least the second time this has happened, you are going to force me to give a verbal warning the next time it happens and then I will write you up the second and then we shall see.""

An interview was held with staff #8 from Facility A on 08/02/2012 at approximately 7:45 PM in the ER  Supervisor's office confirmed patient #1 had (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 3:45 AM requesting to be evaluated. Staff #8 revealed, the ER  clerk called the nurses' station and reported a lady at the registration desk who states she is in labor. Staff #8 told staff #9 to notify MD #11. Staff #8 went to the registration desk to check the situation. Staff #8 revealed, he arrived at the desk and found a lady that stated she was about 24 weeks pregnant and had been having abdominal pain for two days and wanted to be checked out. The lady thought she was in labor. Staff #8 stated that staff #9 was present at the registration desk at this time and both staff members spoke with the lady and her husband. Staff #8 and staff #9 informed the lady that Facility A did not have OB services and did not have an OB physician on staff. They revealed to the lady they were not refusing to see her but she should go to a facility that provides OB services and where her OB Doctor was located. Staff #8 revealed the patient and her husband left the facility at 3:59 AM exactly, ""I remember looking at my watch."" Staff #8 was asked if the patient was offered a medical screening. Staff #8 stated ""no"". Staff #8 was asked if he had any knowledge of what happened to the patient once she left the facility. Staff #8 stated ""yes"". Staff #16 had called staff #8 into the office on 07/27/2012 and revealed the patient's car broke down leaving the patient stranded on the side of the road. The patient was picked up by EMS.

Based on document reviews and interview, Facility A failed to provide a medical screening to 1 of 1 patients presenting in the emergency room    that was twenty four weeks pregnant with a complaint of contractions for two days.

A phone interview was conducted on 08/01/2012 at 2:15 PM with patient #1 from Facility A   confirms she was present in the emergency room    (ER) and did not receive a medical screening.  The interview revealed, ""My husband took me to Facility A's ER.  I was having contractions 5 minutes apart.  When we got to the ER, I nearly went to my knees, the contraction was so strong.  I was registering in the ER  when the Dr. and Nurse came out and told me they were not refusing to care for me but... they told me they didn't have Obstetrical (OB) services there and didn't have an OB Doctor.  They said they didn't know how soon they could get an ambulance because they did not know where they were stationed in the area.  They told me and my husband the best thing for me was to go to Facility C because they had OB services.  They didn't even help get me back to the truck.  We broke down on the side of the road and had to call 911.  The ambulance picked me up on the side of the road and took me to Facility B.""  

A review of Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) Patient Care Report revealed, ""Patient picked up: US Highway 79E. Patient found: in vehicle. Pt. presented to EMS stating that she thought she was in labor. Pt. was having contractions lasting 30 sec-1 min. They were happening about every 5 min. Pt. stated that she felt like she needed to have a bowel movement. Pt. was also having some bloody discharge. Pt. stated that the contractions had started yesterday evening. Pt. was assisted to the cot and into the truck. Pt. stated that she went to Facility A and they advised her that they couldn't do anything and she needed to just go to Facility C. Pt. stated that she had multiple contractions during the trip from Facility A to the point where EMS picked her up. Upon initial transport Facility C was contacted and the Labor and Delivery (L&D) transferred EMS to Pt's doctor. Pt's doctor told EMS to go to Facility B and she would advise the on call doctor that she was coming. Pt. continued to have multiple contractions in route and all thru transport. Pt. was transported directly to Facility B's L&D.""

Review of the operative report dated [DATE] for patient #1 from Facility B revealed,  ""CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING: This patient is a [AGE]-year-old gravida 1 (first pregnancy) who arrived complaining of uterine contractions, by ambulance. The patient had received prenatal care in Facility C. She went to the emergency room    in Facility A and was told to go by private vehicle to Facility C. Her car broke down on the way to Facility C and then got in an ambulance heading toward Facility C that then went to Facility B, per the husband. When she arrived she was 7 cm with a bulging bag of waters, baby was breech by ultrasound with stable fetal heart tones. Therefore she was taken back for a stat caesarean section.""

A review of the document titled, ""History and Physical"" form Facility B, dated 07/25/2012 and timed 6:16 AM revealed, ""HISTORY: Baby Boy is a 24-week, extremely premature infant delivered by a 28-year-old, primigravida (first pregnancy) mom. She was admitted     this morning in advanced labor with abruption. The baby was delivered by caesarian section due to breech presentation. APGAR (assessment of a newborn immediately after birth) scores were 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes. He was intubated (insertion of a breathing tube) in the delivery room and received dose of prophylactic Surfactant.""  The medical chart further revealed at approximately 4:27 PM on 07/31/2012 the baby was pronounced dead. 

An interview was held with staff #16 at Facility A on 08/03/2012 at 9:10 AM in the office across from the Administrative Conference Room with staff #3 present as a witness. Staff #16 was asked if she had knowledge of or had been made aware of a 24 week pregnant woman presenting to the ER  on 07/25/2012 in active labor and asked ER  staff for assistance.  Staff #16 stated ""no"".  Staff #16 recanted and said she was made aware of the incident this morning by ER  staff.  Staff #16 was asked if she had any knowledge of a similar type of OB incident happening in the past. Staff #16 stated ""no"".
 
At approximately 9:30 in the hallway, staff #3 reported that staff #16 had called to make a correction in her statement. The correction was that staff #16 had not been made aware of the incident this morning (08/03/2012) but had been made aware of the incident last night when a night nurse called and informed her (staff #16).

The review of an email dated 07/27/2012 and authored by staff #16 was sent to staff #14 and all ER  staff confirmed that staff #16 had knowledge of patient #1 being present in the ER. The email revealed, ""You cannot tell an OB we don't have OB services. The patient must be brought back and assessed and seen by the ER  doctor. We do have OB services in that we have a physician and a nurse. If an OB patient is told we have no OB services and leaves to go somewhere else and delivers en route or is in a car wreck you and the hospital are legally and morally responsible for the Mother and the baby.  I was told by a family member on Wednesday that we told a pregnant patient we do not have OB services and to go somewhere else. The patient headed to Facility C but her car broke down on the way. They called EMS. The baby was 3 months early and weighed barely over one pound. Whoever told her we don't have OB services could be in big trouble if the patient and her family pursue it ...even if all turns out well. That very scenario is why we have the EMTALA law and this was an EMTALA violation.  Since this is at least the second time this has happened, you are going to force me to give a verbal warning the next time it happens and then I will write you up the second and then we shall see.""

Based on documentation and interviews, hospital #1 failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department or was triaged to the obstetrical unit with an emergency medical condition, received an appropriate transfer/discharge, including prior stabilization, in one of twenty patients reviewed (patient #1). Patient #1 presented to the hospital's OB unit with a complaint of a sudden onset of headaches and a history of hypertension. The hospital nursing staff identified that the patient had an emergency medical condition. The patient was transferred to another hospital, (sixty-eight miles away),  via her private car, for further care. 
Findings include: 

Patient #1 was thirty-eight and 1/7 weeks pregnant and presented to hospital #1 for evaluation of a sudden onset of headaches and a history of hypertension on 3/28/13 at 8:40 p.m. The patient was sent to the obstetric unit by the admissions staff where she was evaluated by nurse (D). The assessment revealed that the patient was not in labor. The patient's blood pressure was 150/90, and a urinalysis revealed that the protein level in the patient's urine was 2+. Nurse (D) contacted the on-call OB/GYN physician (G) about patient #1's symptoms, and the physician provided a telephone order to discharge patient #1 by car to hospital #2 (hospital is located sixty-eight miles from hospital #1) for follow-up care with her primary obstetrician. Physician (G) did not come to the hospital to evaluate patient #1's condition. The patient arrived at hospital #2 on 3/28/13 at 11:35 p.m. without a certification form that summarized the risks and benefits of the transfer and without all of the necessary medical records from hospital #1. Upon her arrival at hospital #2, patient #2 was immediately admitted     to the Obstetrics unit with diagnoses of gestational diabetes, morbid obesity, and pre-eclampsia. Patient #1 complained of a frontal headache and dizziness and her blood pressure was 173/104. Patient #1 was examined at hospital #2 by physician (E), and it was determined that she required a vaginal delivery (via Pitocin induction at 1:24 a.m. on 3/29/13) as soon as possible. However, patient #1's delivery did not progress well, and patient #1 had a Cesarean section with delivery of her infant on 3/30/13 at 10:56 a.m.

Patient #1's 3/28/13 OB record from hospital #1 was reviewed. The admission notes, completed by nurse (D), revealed that patient #1 arrived at hospital #1's OB/GYN unit on 3/28/13 at 8:40 p.m. Patient #1 was in her third trimester of pregnancy (patient #1 was not in labor) and was due on 4/12/13 with her first child. Patient #1 complained of a sudden onset of headaches and indicated she had maternal gestational diabetes. Patient #1 also stated she had a history of hypertension and had been monitoring her blood pressure at home. Due to the risk of patient #1 developing toxemia, patient #1's urine was checked for protein while at hospital #1. Patient #1's protein level was 2+ and her blood pressure was 150/90. Patient #1 was not seen by a physician while at hospital #1. Nurse (D) conducted patient #1's medical screening examination and assessment (including vital signs & fetal heart tones) and provided physician (G) with the results via phone. Physician (G) advised nurse (D) to contact hospital #2 and inform hospital #2 that patient #1 would be discharged    from hospital #1 and would be coming to hospital #2 immediately (sixty-eight miles away) via private car for further evaluation by her primary physician. The record revealed that patient #1 was discharged    and in route to hospital #2 before physician (E) from hospital #2 and physician (G) from hospital #1 discussed patient #1's condition and prior to the transfer being accepted by hospital #2. The record did not reveal that patient #1 requested the discharge/transfer to hospital #2. A certification form that summarized the risks and benefits of the transfer was not completed and discussed with patient #1, and all necessary medical records were not sent with patient #1 at the time of discharge/transfer. Patient #1 was discharged    from hospital #1 at 10:00 p.m. on 3/28/13.

Review of patient #1's 3/28/13 OB record (11:35 p.m. admission) from hospital #2 indicated patient #1 was 38 and 1/7 weeks pregnant, not in labor and that she required an emergent admission to the hospital related to her symptoms and condition. Patient #1 complained of a frontal headache and dizziness and her blood pressure was 173/104 at the time of admission to hospital #2. Patient #1's record verified that patient #1 had maternal gestational diabetes and that she had been insulin controlled since she was twenty-eight weeks pregnant. Patient #1 also had a history of obesity, pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The record indicated patient #1 went to hospital #1 earlier in the evening. Patient #1 was not seen by a physician at hospital #1, and she was asked why she came to hospital #1 instead of going to hospital #2 where patient #1's physician was based. Patient #1 was told to go to hospital #2 (via her personal car) because she had 2+ protein in her urine. An examination at hospital #2 by physician (E) of patient #1's condition revealed that patient #1 required a vaginal delivery (via Pitocin induction at 3/29/13 at 1:24 a.m.) as soon as possible. The record revealed that patient #1's labor did not progress well due to the positioning of the infant, and patient #1 had a Cesarean section with delivery of her infant on 3/30/13 at 10:56 a.m.

Interviews:
When interviewed by phone on 4/12/13 at 2:45 p.m., nurse (D) told the SA investigator she was working on 3/28/13 when patient #1 arrived at hospital #1 and was triaged to the OB unit. Patient #1 complained of a headache, said she was diabetic and said her primary physician had been monitoring her blood pressure and protein level in her urine since she was twenty-two weeks pregnant. Nurse (D) performed patient #1 ' s medical screening examination and called physician (G) and informed him of patient #1's visit to hospital #1. Physician (G) said he would not be coming in to see patient #1, and he wondered why patient #1 came to hospital #1 for care instead of going directly to hospital #2. Patient #1's protein level was 2+, and physician (G) told nurse (D) to discharge patient #1 to hospital #2 and her primary physician for further care. Nurse (D) called hospital #2 and spoke with nurse (F) and told nurse (F) that patient #1 was being discharged    from hospital #1 and sent to hospital #2 for further care with her primary physician. Patient #1 did not request to go to hospital #2, and patient #1 was not offered an ambulance transport to hospital #2. Physician (G) did not discuss the patient's discharge/transfer with on-call physician (E) prior to the patient leaving hospital #1 and being sent to hospital #2 for further care. The only paperwork that was sent with patient #1 was the 3/28/13 laboratory results. 

When interviewed by phone on 4/11/13 at 3:00 p.m., nurse (F) told the SA investigator she received the call from nurse (D) at hospital #1 and nurse (D) said patient #1 was being sent to hospital #2 for further care. Patient #1 was sent to hospital #2 without a prior discussion between physician (G) from hospital #1 and physician (E) from hospital #2 related to the patient's condition and acceptance of transfer by hospital #2. When patient #1 arrived at hospital #2, patient #1 was upset and stated she felt like hospital #1 was trying to get rid of her. When patient #1 arrived, her blood pressure was very elevated and her lower extremities were very edematous. Hospital #1 only sent patient #1's laboratory results with her and did not include any other transfer paperwork. 
When interviewed by phone on 4/11/13 at 2:10 p.m., physician (E) told the SA investigator that he was on-call (OB/GYN) at hospital #2 and received a call from physician (G) who told him that patient #1 was on her way from hospital #1 to hospital #2. There was no prior discussion between physicians (G) and (E) or prior acceptance of the transfer to hospital #2. After his conversation with physician (G), physician (E) determined that patient #1's stability was questionable and that patient #1 should have been transported by ambulance. Patient #1 required immediate hospitalization   related to her symptoms. Patient #1 did not request to be sent to hospital #2. Patient #1 wondered why physician (G) did not come to see her when she was at hospital #1. 
When interviewed by phone on 4/16/13 at 12:50 p.m., physician (G) told the SA investigator that he was on call (OB/GYN) at hospital #1 on the evening of 3/28/13. Nurse (D) called him and told him that patient #1 had a headache and a history of chronic hypertension and that patient #1 was wondering if she should go to hospital #2 related to her symptoms. Physician (G) told nurse (D) to check patient #1's urine for protein, and the urinalysis revealed that her urine was 2+ for protein. Physician (G) directed nurse (D) to discharge patient #1 to hospital #2. Physician (G) stated he thought about coming to hospital #1 to see patient #1 but decided not to come to the hospital. Physician (G) did not speak to physician (E) about patient #1 prior to patient #1 being discharged    and on her way to hospital #2. He did not give nurse (D) an order to transport patient #1 by ambulance to hospital #2 because he thought patient #1 would have to pay the bill for the ambulance. He stated he realizes something could have happened during patient #1's transport via car to hospital #2. He stated he could have admitted     patient #1 to hospital #1 and delivered her baby instead of sending her to hospital #2. 
When interviewed by phone on 4/12/13 at 9:15 a.m., patient #1 told the SA investigator that she lives in a town that is approximately nine miles from hospital #1. She stated her primary physician is affiliated with hospital #2 which is sixty-eight miles from hospital #1. She stated she had a headache and dizziness and had been feeling poorly prior to going to hospital #1 on 3/28/13. She stated her blood pressure had been elevated for ten days prior to going to hospital #1. She stated she knew that these were symptoms of pre-eclampsia, and she stated she was aware of the risks of pre-eclampsia. She realized her condition was serious and that she needed to be hospitalized   . Prior to going to hospital #1, she thought maybe she would be admitted     to hospital #1 and deliver at hospital #1. Hospital #1 did not ask her if she wanted to be admitted     to hospital #1, and she did not request to be discharged    and transferred to hospital #2. Transport to hospital #2 via ambulance was not mentioned as an option, and physician (G) did not come to hospital #1 to see her. She was nervous during the drive to hospital #2 and was fearful that something might go wrong during the trip, such as possibly having a stroke. Hospital #2 was set up for the delivery of her baby when she arrived.

Based on documentation and interviews, hospital #1 failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department or was triaged to the obstetrical unit with an emergency medical condition, received an appropriate transfer/discharge, including prior stabilization, in one of twenty patients reviewed (patient #1). Patient #1 presented to the hospital's OB unit with a complaint of a sudden onset of headaches and a history of hypertension. The hospital nursing staff identified that the patient had an emergency medical condition. The patient was transferred to another hospital, (sixty-eight miles away),  via her private car, for further care. 
Findings include: 

Patient #1 was thirty-eight and 1/7 weeks pregnant and presented to hospital #1 for evaluation of a sudden onset of headaches and a history of hypertension on 3/28/13 at 8:40 p.m. The patient was sent to the obstetric unit by the admissions staff where she was evaluated by nurse (D). The assessment revealed that the patient was not in labor. The patient's blood pressure was 150/90, and a urinalysis revealed that the protein level in the patient's urine was 2+. Nurse (D) contacted the on-call OB/GYN physician (G) about patient #1's symptoms, and the physician provided a telephone order to discharge patient #1 by car to hospital #2 (hospital is located sixty-eight miles from hospital #1) for follow-up care with her primary obstetrician. Physician (G) did not come to the hospital to evaluate patient #1's condition. The patient arrived at hospital #2 on 3/28/13 at 11:35 p.m. without a certification form that summarized the risks and benefits of the transfer and without all of the necessary medical records from hospital #1. Upon her arrival at hospital #2, patient #2 was immediately admitted     to the Obstetrics unit with diagnoses of gestational diabetes, morbid obesity, and pre-eclampsia. Patient #1 complained of a frontal headache and dizziness and her blood pressure was 173/104. Patient #1 was examined at hospital #2 by physician (E), and it was determined that she required a vaginal delivery (via Pitocin induction at 1:24 a.m. on 3/29/13) as soon as possible. However, patient #1's delivery did not progress well, and patient #1 had a Cesarean section with delivery of her infant on 3/30/13 at 10:56 a.m.

Patient #1's 3/28/13 OB record from hospital #1 was reviewed. The admission notes, completed by nurse (D), revealed that patient #1 arrived at hospital #1's OB/GYN unit on 3/28/13 at 8:40 p.m. Patient #1 was in her third trimester of pregnancy (patient #1 was not in labor) and was due on 4/12/13 with her first child. Patient #1 complained of a sudden onset of headaches and indicated she had maternal gestational diabetes. Patient #1 also stated she had a history of hypertension and had been monitoring her blood pressure at home. Due to the risk of patient #1 developing toxemia, patient #1's urine was checked for protein while at hospital #1. Patient #1's protein level was 2+ and her blood pressure was 150/90. Patient #1 was not seen by a physician while at hospital #1. Nurse (D) conducted patient #1's medical screening examination and assessment (including vital signs & fetal heart tones) and provided physician (G) with the results via phone. Physician (G) advised nurse (D) to contact hospital #2 and inform hospital #2 that patient #1 would be discharged    from hospital #1 and would be coming to hospital #2 immediately (sixty-eight miles away) via private car for further evaluation by her primary physician. The record revealed that patient #1 was discharged    and in route to hospital #2 before physician (E) from hospital #2 and physician (G) from hospital #1 discussed patient #1's condition and prior to the transfer being accepted by hospital #2. The record did not reveal that patient #1 requested the discharge/transfer to hospital #2. A certification form that summarized the risks and benefits of the transfer was not completed and discussed with patient #1, and all necessary medical records were not sent with patient #1 at the time of discharge/transfer. Patient #1 was discharged    from hospital #1 at 10:00 p.m. on 3/28/13.

Review of patient #1's 3/28/13 OB record (11:35 p.m. admission) from hospital #2 indicated patient #1 was 38 and 1/7 weeks pregnant, not in labor and that she required an emergent admission to the hospital related to her symptoms and condition. Patient #1 complained of a frontal headache and dizziness and her blood pressure was 173/104 at the time of admission to hospital #2. Patient #1's record verified that patient #1 had maternal gestational diabetes and that she had been insulin controlled since she was twenty-eight weeks pregnant. Patient #1 also had a history of obesity, pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The record indicated patient #1 went to hospital #1 earlier in the evening. Patient #1 was not seen by a physician at hospital #1, and she was asked why she came to hospital #1 instead of going to hospital #2 where patient #1's physician was based. Patient #1 was told to go to hospital #2 (via her personal car) because she had 2+ protein in her urine. An examination at hospital #2 by physician (E) of patient #1's condition revealed that patient #1 required a vaginal delivery (via Pitocin induction at 3/29/13 at 1:24 a.m.) as soon as possible. The record revealed that patient #1's labor did not progress well due to the positioning of the infant, and patient #1 had a Cesarean section with delivery of her infant on 3/30/13 at 10:56 a.m.

Interviews:
When interviewed by phone on 4/12/13 at 2:45 p.m., nurse (D) told the SA investigator she was working on 3/28/13 when patient #1 arrived at hospital #1 and was triaged to the OB unit. Patient #1 complained of a headache, said she was diabetic and said her primary physician had been monitoring her blood pressure and protein level in her urine since she was twenty-two weeks pregnant. Nurse (D) performed patient #1 ' s medical screening examination and called physician (G) and informed him of patient #1's visit to hospital #1. Physician (G) said he would not be coming in to see patient #1, and he wondered why patient #1 came to hospital #1 for care instead of going directly to hospital #2.

The medical screening examination must be conducted utilizing not only all services within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, but also the ancillary services that are routinely available to the Emergency Department.  In other words, all appropriate Hospital resources must be used to pursue an accurate diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s capacity in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition.  If a patient requires transfer, the Hospital will stabilize the patient to the best of its ability prior to such transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with Hospital Policy. ...Discharge.  Disposition of the patient is the responsibility of the physician.  A patient shall not be discharged    with an unstabilized emergency medical condition.  An individual is considered stable and ready for discharge when, within reasonable clinical confidence, it is determined that the individual has reached the point where his/her continued care, including diagnostic work-up and/or treatment, could be reasonably performed as an outpatient or later as an inpatient, provided the individual is given a plan for appropriate follow-up care as part of the discharge instructions.  The emergency medical condition that caused the individual to present to the Emergency Department must be resolved, but the underlying medical condition may persist. ...""

Based on staff interview, review of Labor & Delivery Log and CPEP (Comprehensive Psychiatry Emergency Program) Log, it was determined the facility failed to maintain a complete and accurate log. Specifically, the Labor & Delivery Triage Log did not indicate a disposition for each patient entered into the log and the CPEP log failed to reflect the accurate disposition of each patient. This finding was noted in 5 of 30 sample records from the October - December 2013 logs, and the January - April 2014 logs.

Findings include:

1. The review of the January 2014 L&D log on 4/21/14 revealed Patient #1 was entered into the log on 1/23/14 with no disposition indicated. The patient's chief complaint or reason for the visit was not documented on the log.

The review of patient's record reveals a [AGE] year-old female, Gravida (# of pregnancies) 1, Para (# of > 20 week births) 0,  at 36 weeks 5 days gestation who was evaluated in the L&D triage on 1/21/14 for preeclampsia (a multi-system disorder of pregnancy traditionally characterized by the occurrence of elevated blood pressure and significant amounts of protein in the urine). The hospital summary sheet reviewed on 4/21/14 shows that the patient was admitted on [DATE] to Obstetric Services and discharged    home on 1/25/14.

2. Medical record for Patient #2, notes that this [AGE] year-old female, Gravida 2, Para 1, at 40 weeks gestation presented to the L&D triage on 3/1/14 and was triaged at 9:45 PM with complaints of bloody show. The patient was admitted on [DATE] at 00:30 AM and discharged    from the hospital on [DATE]. However, the March 2014 L&D log listed the patient's name on 3/1/14, but no additional information was noted on the log regarding her disposition. 

3. Record for Patient #3 reviewed on 4/22/14 notes a [AGE] year-old female at 34 weeks 5 days gestation and her EDC (Estimated Date of Confinement - a term for the estimated delivery date for a pregnant woman) on 3/28/14. On 2/19/14 the patient was evaluated in the L&D triage and admitted     to the facility for an elevated bile acid of 241. She was discharged    on [DATE] in stable condition with a plan for Induction of Labor (IOL) at 37 weeks. 

The patient was entered on the L& D triage log on 2/21/14 when she was already an inpatient since 2/19/14. The log did not include the reason for the visit and the disposition of the patient.      

4. The record for Patient #4 reviewed on 4/22/14 noted a [AGE] year-old female at 32 weeks gestation, EDC - 2/21/14. The patient (MDS) dated [DATE] with complaint of chest pain and vomiting and was diagnosed    with gestational hypertension and severe pre-eclampsia (a multi-system disorder of pregnancy traditionally characterized by the occurrence of elevated blood pressure and significant amounts of protein in the urine). She was admitted     for antepartum management and magnesium prophylaxis and discharged    on [DATE] following delivery via caesarean section on 1/2/14.  
This patient was entered on the L&D triage log on 12/30/13 even though she had been admitted on [DATE]. The log entrée for 12/30/13 did not indicate the time of the visit and disposition of the patient.

At interview with Staff #1, on 4/22/14 at 1:15 PM, she stated patients that are evaluated in the L&D triage area are entered into the log daily, so for one patient encounter, the patient's name would be logged in daily until the patient is discharged    home. Staff #1 presented L&D log for Patient #1 who was evaluated on 1/20/14 and discharged    on [DATE]. The L&D log shows the patient was entered on the log on 1/20, 1/21, 1/22, 1/23, 1/24 and on 1/25/14. The disposition of the patient was not entered until 1/25/14 when the patient was discharged   . Staff #1 acknowledged that L&D daily log serves as a daily patient census for the department. 

5. The record for Patient #5 reviewed on 4/22/14 noted that on 11/8/13 this [AGE] year old female was brought to the ED for psychiatric evaluation for suicidal ideation. The patient expressed on face book that if she continues to be in foster care she will kill herself; she wants to go back to her mother. The patient was evaluated and deemed not to be a danger to self and others. She was discharged    to her foster mother with discharge instructions that included an appointment to follow up on 11/15/13 at PM at ""NY Foundling"". The CPEP log listed the disposition as NY Foundling instead of the correct disposition which is ""discharged   "". 

Interview with Staff #2, Associate Director CPEP & Inpatient Psychiatry on 4/22/14 at 3:40 PM, he stated NY Fondling is an Outpatient Treatment Center and the disposition of the patient should have been documented as a discharge.
