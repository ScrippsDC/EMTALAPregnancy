Based on observation, interview and record review, the facility failed to provide within the capabilities of the facility and staff at the hospital, further medical examination and treatment as required to stabilize an emergency medical condition when:

Patient 5 arrived in Hospital 1 Emergency Department (ED) on 3/16/18 at 4:32 p.m. with complaints of severe abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Patient 5 returned to Hospital 1 ED on 3/19/18 with unrelieved abdominal pain and worsening symptoms. Hospital 1 was aware Patient 5 was seen and treated at hospital 2 for the same symptoms on 3/15/18 on Patient 5's visit of 3/16/18. 

These failures resulted in delay in stabilizing treatment for Patient 5 and resulted in Patient 5's unnecessary pain and suffering as a result of the delay.  

Findings:

4/11/18 at 11:20 a.m. a concurrent interview and record review (EHR) was completed with  Clinical Informaticist and former ED RN (CI) 2.
The clinical record indicated Patient 5 is a [AGE] year old female who arrived in the ED on 3/16/18 at 4:32 pm by private car, accompanied by a family member. The clinical record indicated triage of Patient 5 was completed at 4:35 pm and an ESI of 3 was assigned.  The clinical record indicated the chief complaint was abdominal pain for 2 days. The clinical record indicated the initial triage Vital Signs were 36.8 degrees Celsius, Pulse 86, Blood Pressure 116/77. The clinical record indicated the pain level stated by patient 5 as 10 on a scale of 0-10. Patient 5's face sheet indicated her primary language was Spanish and that an interpreter would be needed. Orders were placed by the triage RN using the standardized procedure for abdominal pain, and the clinical record indicated Patient 5 waited in the lobby.

At 4:37 p.m. PA 3 entered a note (scribed). The note indicated Patient 5 was in RME (room not specified). The PA's note documented the chief complaint and triage vital signs.  In the top section of the note the following is documented ""MSE INITIATED at 4:37 p.m.; in the bottom portion of the note under the ""Plan"" section the PA indicated ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE) Initiated at: 5:02 p.m. Patient awaiting further evaluation."" The PA signed this note on 3/24/18 at 6:36 p.m.

At 5:16 pm, labs were drawn for a complete blood count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), and Lipase. The results for the lab samples were provided to the ED at 6 pm and were noted to be within normal limits.

At 5:50 pm a urine specimen was collected and sent to the lab for a urinalysis. Urinalysis results were abnormal, presence of red and white blood cells noted. The urine sample was sent for culture according to the clinical record. 

At 6:31 pm the clinical record event log indicated Patient 5 was moved to ED room 19. CI 2 was asked if the record indicated where the patient was between 4:32 pm and 6:31 pm and stated the record does not specifically indicate that information.
 
At 7:51 pm the record indicated PA 3 spoke with Patient 5 and documented the history of present illness. Patient 5 explained to PA 3 she lived in Sonora and was seen at hospital 2 the previous day with the same symptoms. PA 3 noted Patient 5 had a past medical history of chronic back pain and had an ileus 10 years ago.  PA 3 documented a physical exam which included findings of diffuse abdominal tenderness and diffuse back tenderness with costovertebral angle tenderness.

At 7:51 pm in the same provider note, PA 3 indicated under the heading ED COURSE/Medical DECISION MAKING, that the MSE was initiated at 7:51 p.m. and indicated she will order meds and discuss the case with the ED physician. CI 2 was asked about the documentation in this record of the Medical Screening Exam being initiated at 3 different times: 4:47 p.m., 5:02 p.m., and 7:51 p.m. CI 2 stated there should be only one time documented and that he has no explanation for the 3 different entries in this case.

At 8:27 pm Patient 5's pain level is documented as 8 (0-10 scale). An IV was started and Morphine 4 mg was given IV for pain.

At 9:17 pm the nurse's notes indicated Patient 5 was taken to have a CT.

At 9:36 pm the nurse's notes indicated patient returned from CT and cardiac monitoring was reestablished. Patient 5's pain level was noted to be 8 (0-10), and the note indicated patient 5 was extremely anxious. 

At 10 pm the ED provider note indicated PA 3 ""consulted with [MD 6] who reviewed the CT scan results and said patient can be discharged    home.""

At 10:06 pm the nurse's notes indicated PA 3 was at bedside to reassess patient.
At 10:13 pm PA 3 documented her discussion with Patient 5 about the workup: ""likely ileus, advised fluids, pain and nausea control and rest. Return precautions discussed. Patient instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days. Patient understands and agrees with plan."" 
Review of PA 3 chart entry summarizing the medical decision making indicated ""Patient improved after morphine in the ED. Symptoms consistent with ileus and UTI, although urine sample is contaminated and patient has no urinary symptoms ...patient suitable for outpatient care ...patient discharged    with prescription for Keflex, Zofran, and Norco.""

At 10:20 pm -  4 mg Zofran given IVP for nausea.
At 10:34 pm water provided to patient for PO challenge.
At 10:51 pm the nurses notes indicated patient able to keep water down but patient stated it makes her feel slightly sick to her stomach. PA 3 aware.
At 11:19 pm Patient 5 discharged    home.

The Clinical Informaticist was asked about documentation regarding use of an interpreter for this patient at any time during her stay from 4:32 pm until 11:19 pm since it is indicated on Patient 5's face sheet that her primary language is Spanish and that an interpreter would be needed. CI reviewed the entire record for evidence that an interpreter was used during any communication with Patient 5 and no documentation was found in any form in this record. CI 2 stated there was no documentation that the provider or any of the nurses spoke Spanish fluently. CI 2 stated that the clinical record indicated there was no documentation that a bilingual family member acted as an interpreter for the patient, or that an interpreter was considered or offered. 

The clinical record and concurrent interview continued with CI 2. On 3/19/18 at 3:51 pm Patient 5 arrived in the ED (3 days after the first visit). CI 2 stated the clinical record indicated that triage of Patient 5 was completed at 3:56 pm; an ESI of 3 was assigned. CI 2 stated the clinical record documented the Chief complaint as: ""Abdominal pain- Patient seen here on Friday (3/16/18) for abdominal pain and diagnosed    with an ileus. Patient is now vomiting. Patient states pain medication is not working."" CI 2 stated the clinical record indicated the vital signs at triage were stable and the pain level for Patient 5 was listed as 10 out of scale from 0-10.  

CI 2 stated the clinical record for this visit indicated Patient 5 was provided services and interventions similar to the visit of 3/16/18 with the exception of obtaining a comprehensive history and physical including a history of medication prior to the visit. The hospitalist was called to assess Patient 5 on 3/19/18 and agreed with decision to admit patient. The hospitalist obtained a GI consult who provided a plan for the care of Patient 5.

The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Standardized Procedures in the Emergency Department: Initial Treatment and Diagnostics"" dated 2/14/18, indicated, "" ...PURPOSE: To provide for the ordering of diagnostic studies and initial treatment prior to exam of the patient by a physician/NP/PA ...to facilitate diagnosis, expedite flow, improve care for the patient ...

Based on interview, review of documentation in 4 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCHHC to another hospital for specialty services not available at SCHHC (Patients 1, 4, 12 and 20) and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved. The following required appropriate transfer elements were not carried out:
* It was unclear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capability had been provided.
* The receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient for further examination and stabilizing treatment within the receiving hospital's capability and capacity.
* There was no physician certification, or the physician certification lacked patient specific and individualized medical benefits vs patient specific risks of transfer.
* Transfers were not affected using appropriate transportation with qualified personnel and necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during transfer. 
* Medical records were not sent to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The hospital's organizational chart dated 01/11/2019 and the hospital's website reflected that the hospital provided medical, surgical, respiratory, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency and swing-bed services. Services provided did not include obstetrical services. 

2. There were no policies and procedures that complied with EMTALA requirements to ensure that all patients for whom an MSE determined required further examination and stabilizing treatment not within the capability or capacity of SCHHC would receive an appropriate transfer to another hospital that had the capability and capacity. Policies and procedures provided were unclear, incomplete and inaccurate. Those policies and procedures were not customized for SCHHC and did not clearly and accurately reflect provisions to ensure the hospital's compliance with its obligations under EMTALA. The only references to appropriate transfers were in the following three documents: 

a. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Obstetric triage of patients"" was dated as revised 02/16/2018 and contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""Having specific procedures for obstetric triage ensures compliance with Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) regulations, which require health care practitioners to examine a patient to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, to provide necessary stabilizing treatment when an emergency medical condition is identified, and to stabilize the patient or, if a practitioner certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, arrange for proper transfer to another facility. In addition, hospitals are prohibited from delaying patient assessment and treatment because of a patient's insurance coverage or ability to pay. Under EMTALA, a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other qualified medical professional (acting within the scope of practice and state law) is required to certify all patient assessments and dispositions."" 

This procedure contained the following reference to transfers that reflected ""If the patient is to be transferred to another facility: Ensure that the patient has been informed of the risks involved and has signed a consent form for transfer. Confirm that permissions has been obtained from both facilities, that the practitioner has certified in writing that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, that the patient's necessary medical records will accompany her, and that any necessary equipment and qualified personnel will be present during transport. Make sure that the reconciled list of the patient's medications has been communicated to the next practitioner who will be caring for the patient...Make sure that handoff communication is provided to the person who will assume responsibility for the patient's care and that it is documented in the patient's medical record."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the 10-page document. 

b. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Patient Transfer"" contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""To provide guidelines for the safe transfer of patients to another facility in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations including but not limited to Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), as well as industry best practices...Patients may be transferred from [SCHHC] for a variety of reasons including patient's condition requiring treatment not available at SCHHC or patient request...Provider makes decision to transfer patient to another facility and determines appropriateness of transfer, in accordance with all federal and state regulations...Provider contacts receiving provide for patient acceptance and gives report to receiving provider. Provider completes appropriate transfer form...Hospital staff arranges for patient transportation via provider designated level of transportation...Nursing staff copies patient's visit information including, as applicable: [all medical record documentation]..."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the document. 

c. The SCHHC ""Medical Staff Rules & Regulations"" dated as approved on 01/12/2016 contained the following reference to EMTALA transfers: 
* ""[SCHHC], in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), along with all members of the Medical Staff, will comply with the policies regarding patient transfers and shall comply with all applicable laws regarding patient transfers."" 

There was no other information related to EMTALA transfers.

3. a. The ED medical record of Patient 20 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 0805 and included the following documentation related to Patient 20's ED encounter:
* At 0825 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that the patient was ""37.3 weeks pregnant, not feeling baby kick x 2 days,"" the patient's BP was 149/94, and ""Dopplered baby HR, started at 80bpm finished at 144bmp (sic).""
* At 0847 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""ER Disposition...Diagnosis: Decreased fetal movement...discharged   ...You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation.""
* At 0850 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that ""Pt concerned with baby not kicking much x2 days, doppler heartrate 80bpm with contraction, 144bpm otherwise. Instructed to go to BAH right away after discharge.""
* At 0855 Patient 20 signed an ""ED Discharge Instructions"" document that reflected ""Discharge Instructions...Diagnosis: Decreased Fetal movement...Disposition: discharged   ; Condition: Stable; Diagnosis Specific Education: Diagnosis related handout given; Medication Risks, Benefits, Alternatives; You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation."" 
* At 0904 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""Patient is 37 weeks pregnant and presents stating that [he/she] has felt decreased fetal movements for the past couple of days and wants to make sure the baby has a heartbeat. Up until this point, there have been no complications with the pregnancy. [He/she] has not had any pain. No vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluids...Limited bedside ultrasound performed to assess fetal viability. Fetus had decreased activity. FHR initially was around 120-140. However, while the probe was still on the abdomen, the HR dropped to around the 80's. The patient stated [he/she] felt like [he/she] may be having a contraction. This is a sign of fetal distress, and I instructed the patient to go directly to Bay Area Hospital for OB eval, likely NST. The patient was here with [his/her] sibling], who will take [Patient 20] directly to Bay Area...Disposition: discharged   , Condition: Stable."" 
* There was no transfer form required by the transfer policy identified under finding 2. b. above.

There was no documentation in the ED medical record, including on the transfer form required by hospital transfer procedures, to reflect that an appropriate transfer had been affected: 
* It was not clear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capabilities had been provided.
* BAH had not accepted the patient in transfer.
* The ED MD had not certified that the reasons and benefits for the transfer outweighed the patient-specific risks of transfer.
* Medical records were not sent. 
* Patient 20 who had signs of ""fetal distress"" was not transferred using appropriate transportation, equipment and qualified personnel and instead was told to drive to BAH in a private vehicle. 
* It was not evident whether the patient had refused appropriate transportation or whether the use of a private vehicle was offered or encouraged by ED staff. 
* Patient 20 had not been informed of the additional risks of transport via private vehicle with an EMC that had not been ruled out, removed or resolved.

b. An on-line distance calculator reflected that the distance between SCHHC and BAH is approximately 27 miles and drive time of 43 minutes on rural, coastal two-lane highway.   

c.  Further, review of the central log for Patient 20 reflected that he/she presented to the ED for a ""pregnancy concern"" and the disposition from the ED was recorded as ""home."" However, review of the ED record for Patient 20 reflected that the patient was experiencing ""fetal distress"" and he/she was directed by the ED MD to go to another hospital via private vehicle immediately. The log did not accurately reflect that the patient was sent or transferred to another hospital. Refer to Tag C2405 that reflects the central log for Patient 20 was not accurate.  

d. Documentation on SCHHC ""Follow up Communication Center"" notes included the following in relation to Patient 20's ED encounter:
* On 01/18/2019 at 1133 an entry reflected ""Spoke with nurse on duty...[he/she] stated [he/she] was under the impression that [ED MD] had consulted someone at BAH before [the nurse] discharged    the patient...[he/she] assumed [ED MD] had spoken to someone at BAH before we discharged    the pt."" 
* On 01/21/2019 at 1204 an entry reflected ""...we were able to identify that we made an EMTALA violation. [BAH staff] reported that [Patient 20] went in for an immediate C Section. Baby's apagars (sic) we (sic) 3 and 5. The baby stayed for a brief time and was transferred to [SHRB].""
* On 01/21/2019 at 1547 an entry reflected ""[ED RN] states [he/she] 'assumed [ED MD] had consulted someone'...also said, 'I asked [ED MD] if the patient was going to go by ground ambulance? the provider told [ED RN] no the pt is going by private vehicle.'

e. During interview with hospital leadership staff that included the CEO, CNO and R&Q on 01/30/2019 at 1640 it was confirmed that Patient 20 who (MDS) dated [DATE] with complications of pregnancy had not been appropriately transferred, including having been directed by the ED physician to drive him/herself to BAH for obstetric services. They further stated that as soon as they became aware of the violation they initiated an investigation and began to implement corrective actions that included policy development, and medical staff and ED staff training. 

4. a. The ED medical record of Patient 1 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1755 and included the following documentation related to Patient 1's encounter:
* At 1806 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that ""patient states this is [his/her] 4th pregnancy...1 previous miscarriage at 6 weeks of gest,...complaint of vag bleeding and cramping since 1400 [yesterday], reports being 5 weeks pregnant.""
* At 1830 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""Patient with vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain in [his/her] 1st trimester differential diagnosis should include, (sic) abortion, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED], molar pregnancy. H&H within normal limits, serum quantitative HCG pending, vital signs within normal limits, no ultrasound available at this time in this facility. case discussed with the emergency physician from Bay Area Hospital [BAH ED MD] who accepted the patient for transfer. I had an extensive discussion with the patient about need for follow up and indications to return. They agree to this plan and can return if needed.""
* At 1834 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that and IV access was obtained and labs were drawn from that access. 
* At 1918 the MD documented on the ""Patient Transfer Form"" that ""I authorize/order the transfer of [Patient 1] to BAH...I further certify that this patient's emergency medical condition is stabilized and he/she is able to be transferred by non-ambulance transfer...Support/treatment during transfer [none]...Condition: Stable [not checked]...Unstable [not checked]...Physician Certification...Benefit(s) of transfer: ultrasound...Risk(s) of transfer (in addition to deterioration of patient's condition/clinically specific): Accident...Risks of transport: All transfers have the inherent risks of traffic delays, accident during transport...""
* At 1945 the ""Patient Left the Building"" as documented by an RN on the ""Patient Transfer Form."" The RN also documented that the patient had an ""IV access 20[gauge]"" in place; that numerous records were sent with the patient that included ""Xrays/CT Scans."" 
* At 1955 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that ""Disposition: Transferred...Transferred Via: Ambulatory, Private auto; Accompanied by: Patient, Spouse/SO; Reason for Transfer: Patient requires services which are not available at the transferring hospital at time of the patient's transfer...Mode of Transportation: Private Care; Support/Treatment During Transfer: None...Accompanying Documentation sent via: Patient/Responsible Party...Transport team from ___ at bedside to provide transport to receiving hospital for further care. Verbal report given. Transfer Form and accompanying documentation sent with this team for receiving hospital...Pt transferred and self transported to BAH to report to the ED...Pt has IV in place. MD states to leave IV intact. Receiving nurse advised. Pt transported by spouse via private auto."" 

The record contained the following inconsistencies and omissions:

* The disposition documentation by the RN was not clear where it reflected that the patient was transported both by a ""transport team"" and by ""spouse via private auto.""

The documentation reflected that an appropriate transfer had not been affected: 
* It was not clear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capabilities had been provided.
* The ED MD's certification that the reasons and benefits for the transfer outweighed the risks of transfer did not identify the patient-specific, ""clinically specific"" risks of the transfer and identified only ""Accident"" as a risk when that was already identified as a generic risk for all transport.
* Patient 1 was not transferred using appropriate transportation with qualified personnel and instead was told to drive to BAH in a private vehicle with an IV access in place.

c. In addition, review of the central log for Patient 12 reflected that he/she presented to the ED for ""personal (sic) issue"" and the disposition from the ED was recorded as ""home."" However, review of the ED record for Patient 12 reflected that the ED MD consulted the BAH urologist on call and sent the patient to the BAH urologist for further examination and stabilizing treatment. The log did not accurately reflect the reason the patient presented and did not reflect that the patient was sent ""immediately"" to another hospital's on-call physician. Refer to Tag C2405 that reflects the central log for Patient 12 was not accurate.

7. During interview with the R&Q and the NM on 01/31/2019 during review of documents beginning at 1130 they confirmed that the hospital's EMTALA policies and procedures were incomplete and stated that ""draft"" policies and procedures were in progress. 






","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview, review of documentation in 4 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCHHC to another hospital for specialty services not available at SCHHC (Patients 1, 4, 12 and 20) and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved. The following required appropriate transfer elements were not carried out:
* It was unclear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capability had been provided.
* The receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient for further examination and stabilizing treatment within the receiving hospital's capability and capacity.
* There was no physician certification, or the physician certification lacked patient specific and individualized medical benefits vs patient specific risks of transfer.
* Transfers were not affected using appropriate transportation with qualified personnel and necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during transfer. 
* Medical records were not sent to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The hospital's organizational chart dated 01/11/2019 and the hospital's website reflected that the hospital provided medical, surgical, respiratory, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency and swing-bed services. Services provided did not include obstetrical services. 

2. There were no policies and procedures that complied with EMTALA requirements to ensure that all patients for whom an MSE determined required further examination and stabilizing treatment not within the capability or capacity of SCHHC would receive an appropriate transfer to another hospital that had the capability and capacity. Policies and procedures provided were unclear, incomplete and inaccurate. Those policies and procedures were not customized for SCHHC and did not clearly and accurately reflect provisions to ensure the hospital's compliance with its obligations under EMTALA. The only references to appropriate transfers were in the following three documents: 

a. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Obstetric triage of patients"" was dated as revised 02/16/2018 and contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""Having specific procedures for obstetric triage ensures compliance with Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) regulations, which require health care practitioners to examine a patient to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, to provide necessary stabilizing treatment when an emergency medical condition is identified, and to stabilize the patient or, if a practitioner certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, arrange for proper transfer to another facility. In addition, hospitals are prohibited from delaying patient assessment and treatment because of a patient's insurance coverage or ability to pay. Under EMTALA, a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other qualified medical professional (acting within the scope of practice and state law) is required to certify all patient assessments and dispositions."" 

This procedure contained the following reference to transfers that reflected ""If the patient is to be transferred to another facility: Ensure that the patient has been informed of the risks involved and has signed a consent form for transfer. Confirm that permissions has been obtained from both facilities, that the practitioner has certified in writing that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, that the patient's necessary medical records will accompany her, and that any necessary equipment and qualified personnel will be present during transport. Make sure that the reconciled list of the patient's medications has been communicated to the next practitioner who will be caring for the patient...Make sure that handoff communication is provided to the person who will assume responsibility for the patient's care and that it is documented in the patient's medical record."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the 10-page document. 

b. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Patient Transfer"" contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""To provide guidelines for the safe transfer of patients to another facility in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations including but not limited to Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), as well as industry best practices...Patients may be transferred from [SCHHC] for a variety of reasons including patient's condition requiring treatment not available at SCHHC or patient request...Provider makes decision to transfer patient to another facility and determines appropriateness of transfer, in accordance with all federal and state regulations...Provider contacts receiving provide for patient acceptance and gives report to receiving provider. Provider completes appropriate transfer form...Hospital staff arranges for patient transportation via provider designated level of transportation...Nursing staff copies patient's visit information including, as applicable: [all medical record documentation]..."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the document. 

c. The SCHHC ""Medical Staff Rules & Regulations"" dated as approved on 01/12/2016 contained the following reference to EMTALA transfers: 
* ""[SCHHC], in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), along with all members of the Medical Staff, will comply with the policies regarding patient transfers and shall comply with all applicable laws regarding patient transfers."" 

There was no other information related to EMTALA transfers.

3. a. The ED medical record of Patient 20 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 0805 and included the following documentation related to Patient 20's ED encounter:
* At 0825 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that the patient was ""37.3 weeks pregnant, not feeling baby kick x 2 days,"" the patient's BP was 149/94, and ""Dopplered baby HR, started at 80bpm finished at 144bmp (sic).""
* At 0847 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""ER Disposition...Diagnosis: Decreased fetal movement...discharged   ...You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation.""
* At 0850 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that ""Pt concerned with baby not kicking much x2 days, doppler heartrate 80bpm with contraction, 144bpm otherwise. Instructed to go to BAH right away after discharge.""
* At 0855 Patient 20 signed an ""ED Discharge Instructions"" document that reflected ""Discharge Instructions...Diagnosis: Decreased Fetal movement...Disposition: discharged   ; Condition: Stable; Diagnosis Specific Education: Diagnosis related handout given; Medication Risks, Benefits, Alternatives; You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation."" 
* At 0904 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""Patient is 37 weeks pregnant and presents stating that [he/she] has felt decreased fetal movements for the past couple of days and wants to make sure the baby has a heartbeat. Up until this point, there have been no complications with the pregnancy. [He/she] has not had any pain. No vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluids...Limited bedside ultrasound performed to assess fetal viability. Fetus had decreased activity. FHR initially was around 120-140. However, while the probe was still on the abdomen, the HR dropped to around the 80's. The patient stated [he/she] felt like [he/she] may be having a contraction. This is a sign of fetal distress, and I instructed the patient to go directly to Bay Area Hospital for OB eval, likely NST. The patient was here with [his/her] sibling], who will take [Patient 20] directly to Bay Area...Disposition: discharged   , Condition: Stable."" 
* There was no transfer form required by the transfer policy identified under finding 2. b. above.

There was no documentation in the ED medical record, including on the transfer form required by hospital transfer procedures, to reflect that an appropriate transfer had been affected: 
* It was not clear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capabilities had been provided.
* BAH had not accepted the patient in transfer.
* The ED MD had not certified that the reasons and benefits for the transfer outweighed the patient-specific risks of transfer.
* Medical records were not sent. 
* Patient 20 who had signs of ""fetal distress"" was not transferred using appropriate transportation, equipment and qualified personnel and instead was told to drive to BAH in a private vehicle. 
* It was not evident whether the patient had refused appropriate transportation or whether the use of a private vehicle was offered or encouraged by ED staff. 
* Patient 20 had not been informed of the additional risks of transport via private vehicle with an EMC that had not been ruled out, removed or resolved.

b. An on-line distance calculator reflected that the distance between SCHHC and BAH is approximately 27 miles and drive time of 43 minutes on rural, coastal two-lane highway.   

c.  Further, review of the central log for Patient 20 reflected that he/she presented to the ED for a ""pregnancy concern"" and the disposition from the ED was recorded as ""home."" However, review of the ED record for Patient 20 reflected that the patient was experiencing ""fetal distress"" and he/she was directed by the ED MD to go to another hospital via private vehicle immediately. The log did not accurately reflect that the patient was sent or transferred to another hospital. Refer to Tag C2405 that reflects the central log for Patient 20 was not accurate.  

d. Documentation on SCHHC ""Follow up Communication Center"" notes included the following in relation to Patient 20's ED encounter:
* On 01/18/2019 at 1133 an entry reflected ""Spoke with nurse on duty...[he/she] stated [he/she] was under the impression that [ED MD] had consulted someone at BAH before [the nurse] discharged    the patient...[he/she] assumed [ED MD] had spoken to someone at BAH before we discharged    the pt."" 
* On 01/21/2019 at 1204 an entry reflected ""...we were able to identify that we made an EMTALA violation. [BAH staff] reported that [Patient 20] went in for an immediate C Section. Baby's apagars (sic) we (sic) 3 and 5. The baby stayed for a brief time and was transferred to [SHRB].""
* On 01/21/2019 at 1547 an entry reflected ""[ED RN] states [he/she] 'assumed [ED MD] had consulted someone'...also said, 'I asked [ED MD] if the patient was going to go by ground ambulance? the provider told [ED RN] no the pt is going by private vehicle.'

e. During interview with hospital leadership staff that included the CEO, CNO and R&Q on 01/30/2019 at 1640 it was confirmed that Patient 20 who (MDS) dated [DATE] with complications of pregnancy had not been appropriately transferred, including having been directed by the ED physician to drive him/herself to BAH for obstetric services. They further stated that as soon as they became aware of the violation they initiated an investigation and began to implement corrective actions that included policy development, and medical staff and ED staff training. 

4. a. The ED medical record of Patient 1 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1755 and included the following documentation related to Patient 1's encounter:
* At 1806 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that ""patient states this is [his/her] 4th pregnancy...1 previous miscarriage at 6 weeks of gest,...complaint of vag bleeding and cramping since 1400 [yesterday], reports being 5 weeks pregnant.""

The record contained the following inconsistencies and omissions:
* There was no documentation to reflect the details of the MD's ""extensive discussion with the patient.""
* There was no documentation to reflect that ""Xrays/CT Scans"" identified on the transfer form had been obtained during the ED visit.
* The disposition documentation by the RN was not clear where it reflected that the patient was transported both by a ""transport team"" and by ""spouse via private auto.""

The documentation reflected that an appropriate transfer had not been affected:

Based on interview, review of documentation in 6 of 6 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCR to another hospital for services SCR did not have capability to provide at that time (Patients 1, 3, 8, 11, 16, and 17), and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved as the physician certification that the benefits of transfer outweighed the risks of transfer did not reflect that patient specific, individualized risks of transfer had been identified.

Findings include:

1. The hospital policy and procedure titled ""EMTALA Rights and Responsibilities,"" dated ""Effective Date: 06/29/2016"" was reviewed. It reflected ""The purpose of this policy is to describe how St. Charles Health System, Inc. (St. Charles) and its hospitals will comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ... (2) providing necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer to each patient determined to have an EMC ...

Based on interview, review of documentation in 6 of 6 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCR to another hospital for services SCR did not have capability to provide at that time (Patients 1, 3, 8, 11, 16, and 17), and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved as the physician certification that the benefits of transfer outweighed the risks of transfer did not reflect that patient specific, individualized risks of transfer had been identified.

Based on record review, policy review and staff interview the facility failed to ensure staff complied with EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) for failure to provide a Medical Screening Examination (MSE) for 1 of 20 sampled patients (Patient 1) and also failed to include Patient 1 in the Central Log. Findings are:

A.  Review of  facility policy titled ""Emtala Compliance Plan"" effective date 5/1/87 under section titled ""Procedures"" states ""'Upon presentation on LRHC [Lexington Regional Health Center] property, an individual who is not otherwise a patient of LRHC shall be provided an appropriate medical screening examination or treatment for a medical condition."" The policy also states that a ""central log shall be maintained on each individual who comes to the Emergency Department seeking assistance, recording whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, was transferred, was admitted     or treated, was stabilized and transferred or was discharged   .""

B. Review of Patient 1's 11/25/18  medical record showed the patient presented for care at 8:15 AM.    Documentation by obstetrical (OB) nurse B at 12:17 PM, approximately 4 hours after patient # 1 left the ED showed that patient # 1 called staff at Lexington Regional Health Center prior to arrival at 8:15 AM stating that she was planning to present to be checked out because she had been having contractions through the night.  Further documentation showed that the patient arrived and stated she was 33 weeks pregnant. RN B documented the patient stated she had been having contractions all night.  Further documentation by OB RN B indicated she told patient # 1  they would put her on the monitor and evaluate her. Obstetrical (OB) Medical Doctor (MD) ""B"" was on call and would be seeing her. The patient said she did not want to be seen by MD B.  OB RN B informed the patient that if in labor she would deliver at Lexington Regional and that if the baby had any problems, the baby would be transferred for specialized care.  Further concerns were voiced by the parents regarding ability to transfer due to weather (snowing on 11/25/18). OB RN B documented the patient/spouse decided to go to Kearney for special care. The nursing notes indicated the patient decided to ""leave without being seen."" 

RN A witnessed the patient arriving at the hospital and leaving the hospital approximately 5 minutes later but was not present when RN B interacted with patient # 1 and her husband.  RN A and RN B documented on facility form titled ""Refusal of Exam/Treatment Form"" that the patient ""refused to be placed on fetal monitor, refused to see [name of MD B]"" and ""refused all cares."" The nurses documented the patient left without being seen prior to signing the Against Medical Advice form.  

C.  In an interview on 12/4/18 at 11:45 AM,  RN A, Emergency Department Director confirmed she talked with Patient 1 prior to arrival. The patient was a patient of MD C, was 33 weeks and was having contractions all night.  RN A stated she told Patient 1 that she needed to be seen.  RN A stated she recalled telling the patient ""we will have a bed for you.""  RN A recalled seeing the patient walking down the hall with RN B to the OB room.  RN A said she then saw RN B, the patient and her husband come out of the room. The entire interaction was about 5 minutes.  

D.  Interview with OB RN B 12/4/18 at 9:50 AM. RN B stated the OB RN's have special training on conducting a MSE on OB patients The MSE includes putting the patient on the monitor, head to toe assessment, assess fetal heart tones, evaluate monitor strip and notify the OB on call.

On 11/25/18 OB RN B was the OB RN for the day. She recalled RN A reported a 33 week pregnant high risk (for complications) patient was coming  in.  RN B walked with them to the OB patient room. I asked if she doctored here and she said  yes (MD C). She recalled telling the patient that MD B was on call not MD C. The patient said ""I do not see [name of MD B].""

RN B recalled having a conversation with the patient telling her that at 33 weeks they needed to make sure she was safe and needed to stay here. I ""explained state law that you are here in our facility and we have to check her out.""  The patient replied she was 33 weeks and was told she would deliver here and stabilize and move to other facility. If not in labor they could send her by air or ground ambulance with fetal heart monitor and OB nurse. The patient again stated ""I don't see [name of MD B]"".  Her husband then came in the room and asked his wife ""do you want to go to Kearney?"" The patient said ""yes"" and they left. RN B recalled telling them ""you need to stay to check that you are not in labor"". They left the hospital and did not sign consent to treat or Against Medical Advice paperwork. 

RN B stated we did not enter the patient in the Central Log because we did not do a medical screening examination (MSE).

E.  Review of receiving Hospital ""D"" history and physical dated 11/25/18 indicated that patient # 1 ""presents with complaints of contractions at 33 weeks gestational age.  Further documentation showed that the patient sees [Name of MD C] in Lexington for her pregnancy.  Documentation in the medical record indicated the patient stated she presented to the hospital (in Lexington) this morning and spoke to a nurse with complaints of contractions. She was not checked or hooked up to a monitor and was told to drive by a private car to Kearney due to concern for possible preterm delivery and them not having adequate care for preterm infants. Upon presentation here the patient reported she is feeling contractions approximately every 3 minutes.  She was diagnosed    with preterm labor and admitted    . Review of the operative report 11/25/18 noted that shortly after admission patient # 1's membranes ruptured with a large amount of blood loss.  Fetal heart rate dropped and a emergency C-section (surgical opening of the abdomen/uterus to deliver the infant) was needed. The preterm infant was taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU).

F. Telephone interview with Patient 1 on 12/11/18 at 12:00 PM revealed the patient was told by the OB nurse who took her to a room on OB, that ""just so you know, we are not equipped to handle a 34 week baby and if you deliver we would have to call a helicopter and can't guarantee they can fly today"", referring to the weather/snow.  Patient # 1 stated the nurse said that [ MD B] was on call.  Patient # 1 stated she wanted  her doctor [MD C ] called and the nurse told her she could not. Patient 1 also recalled the OB nurse telling her that ""if it was my baby I would go to [Name of Hospital D]."" The nurse told her that if I admit you I need to examine you and if you're in active labor we must keep you. Patient 1 said she was having contractions and ""did not refuse service."" The RN told her they did not need to call [name of Hospital D] but to go straight to the emergency room   .  Patient # 1 stated she arrived at Hospital D 45 minutes to 1 hour later. Patient # 1 stated her contractions were 3 minutes apart and that 30 minutes after she arrived, her water broke.

Based on document review and staff interviews, the administrative staff failed to ensure the critical access hospital's (CAH's) ED staff provided 1 of 1 pregnant women (Patient #1) with an appropriate medical screening examination after presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) by ambulance seeking medical care.  Failure to provide an appropriate medical screening exam at the CAH resulted in EMS staff transporting Patient #1 to Hospital A, which resulted in a delay of Patient #1 receiving an appropriate medical screening exam by more than 30 minutes. The CAH's administrative staff identified an average of 244 patients per month who presented to the CAH's dedicated emergency department and requested emergency medical care.

Findings include:

1. Review of Patient #1's medical record at the CAH revealed RN E retrieved Patient #1's demographics, allergies, and reported home medications from the CAH's electronic medical record system. RN E documented that Patient #1 arrived at the CAH at 9:42 PM on 4/11/21, with a chief compliant of ""OB Complications.""  The medical record did not contain evidence that Patient # 1 received a medical screening examination.  

2. Review of Patient #1's medical record at Hospital A revealed that Paramedic D documented in Patient #1's medical record that the ambulance was dispatched to Patient #1's home for a female ""18 weeks pregnant, in labor."" Patient #1's chief complaint was ""ruptured placenta"" (tearing of the connection between mother and baby in the uterus, a life threatening emergency for the baby).

Paramedic D initiated transport to the CAH, per Patient #1's request. Paramedic D called the CAH's ED and notified them that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and medical condition. During Patient #1's transport to the CAH, Patient #1 experienced ""pressure"" and ""contractions"" in the ambulance.

When the ambulance arrived at the CAH, the CAH staff instructed the EMS staff to divert the ambulance to Hospital A, as the CAH staff had closed the Obstetric (OB) unit. Patient #1 experienced contractions lasting less than 1 minute at 10:05 PM (23 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), 10:07 PM (25 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), and 10:10 PM (28 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

The ambulance containing Patient #1 presented to Hospital A at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 (31 minutes after presenting to the CAH). ED Physician H examined Patient #1 at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 and documented that Patient #1's water broke before 37 weeks of Patient #1's pregnancy (placing Patient #1's baby's life in jeopardy). ED Physician H consulted with ED Physician I at Hospital B, who agreed to accept Patient #1 for continued care. The ED staff at Hospital A transferred Patient #1 to Hospital B via a separate ambulance on 4/12/21 at 12:59 AM (137 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).


3. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 9:10 AM, Paramedic D revealed they went to Patient #1's home in response to a 911 call. Upon the arrival of Paramedic D's ambulance at Patient #1's house, Paramedic D assessed Patient #1. During the assessment, Patient #1 revealed they received their normal care at the CAH. Based on Patient #1 receiving their care at the CAH, Paramedic D instructed the other EMS crew members to transport Patient #1 to the CAH.

Approximately 5 minutes prior to the ambulance arriving at the CAH, Paramedic D called the CAH and notified the CAH ED staff that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and current medical status. The CAH ED staff indicated the ED staff would see Patient #1 when the ambulance arrived at the CAH.

Upon the ambulance's arrival at the ED, Paramedic F (who worked at the CAH) informed the EMS crew that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services and the EMS crew should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A, as Patient #1 had an obstetrical chief complaint. Per Paramedic F's instructions, Paramedic D instructed the EMS crew to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A. During the transport from the CAH to Hospital A, Patient #1 began experiencing increasing contractions.

4. During an interview on 5/12/21 at 1:35 PM, Ambulance Driver A revealed that they picked Patient #1 up at Patient #1's home. Paramedic D informed Ambulance Driver A to transport Patient #1 to the CAH. Upon arrival at the CAH, Paramedic F approached Ambulance Driver A and asked why the ambulance was at the CAH. Paramedic F (who worked for the CAH) informed Ambulance Driver A that the CAH did not have obstetrical services. Ambulance Driver A instructed Paramedic F to speak to Paramedic D about Patient #1. After Paramedic F spoke with Paramedic D, Paramedic D instructed Ambulance Driver A to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A.

5. During an interview on 5/12/21 at 3:00 PM, RN E revealed they received a call from the county sheriff's department that the ambulance was bringing a patient to the CAH who was 18 weeks pregnant and complaining of cramping (an early sign of labor). RN E took down the information for Patient #1 from the sheriff's department staff and registered Patient #1 in the CAH's electronic medical record. RN E informed ED Physician G and Paramedic F that an ambulance was bringing Patient #1 to the CAH and Patient #1 was complaining about cramping while also 18 weeks pregnant. 

During RN E's conversation with Paramedic F, Paramedic F informed RN E that the ambulance staff should not bring Patient #1 to the CAH, as the CAH lacked obstetrical services. RN E informed Paramedic F that the CAH ED staff needed to evaluate Patient #1, as failing to evaluate Patient #1 was possibly an EMTALA violation. 

While RN E prepared the CAH's ED for Patient #1's arrival, Paramedic F informed RN E that Paramedic F went out to the ambulance after it arrived on the CAH's property, informed the ambulance crew that the CAH lacked obstetrical services, and that the ambulance crew needed to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A.

6. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 8:00 AM, Paramedic F (who worked for the CAH) revealed that RN E received a call informing RN E about an ambulance on its way to the CAH with an obstetrical patient. Paramedic F inquired why the ambulance staff chose to bring an obstetrical patient to the CAH, as the CAH lacked obstetrical services. When the ambulance arrived on the CAH's property, Paramedic F went out to meet the ambulance outside the ambulance bay. Paramedic F informed Paramedic D that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services, and Paramedic D should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A (which offered obstetrical services).

7. During an interview on 5/12/21 at 3:30 PM, CAH ED Physician G revealed that RN E informed ED Physician G that an ambulance with an obstetrical patient was on its way to the CAH. ED Physician G indicated they regularly provided obstetrical care to patients, ED Physician G was comfortable providing obstetrical care to Patient #1, and could have provided obstetrical care to Patient #1, including delivering Patient #1's baby if needed. 

ED Physician G asked RN E to print off Patient #1's obstetrical history, so ED Physician G could best provide care to Patient #1 upon their arrival to the ED. ED Physician G indicated that if they knew Patient #1 was on the CAH's property, ED Physician G would have evaluated Patient #1.

Based on document review and staff interviews, the administrative staff failed to ensure the critical access hospital's (CAH's) ED staff provided 1 of 1 pregnant women (Patient #1) with an appropriate medical screening examination after presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) by ambulance seeking medical care.  Failure to provide an appropriate medical screening exam at the CAH resulted in EMS staff transporting Patient #1 to Hospital A, which resulted in a delay of Patient #1 receiving an appropriate medical screening exam by more than 30 minutes. The CAH's administrative staff identified an average of 244 patients per month who presented to the CAH's dedicated emergency department and requested emergency medical care.

Findings include:

1. Review of Patient #1's medical record at the CAH revealed RN E retrieved Patient #1's demographics, allergies, and reported home medications from the CAH's electronic medical record system. RN E documented that Patient #1 arrived at the CAH at 9:42 PM on 4/11/21, with a chief compliant of ""OB Complications.""  The medical record did not contain evidence that Patient # 1 received a medical screening examination.  

2. Review of Patient #1's medical record at Hospital A revealed that Paramedic D documented in Patient #1's medical record that the ambulance was dispatched to Patient #1's home for a female ""18 weeks pregnant, in labor."" Patient #1's chief complaint was ""ruptured placenta"" (tearing of the connection between mother and baby in the uterus, a life threatening emergency for the baby).

Paramedic D initiated transport to the CAH, per Patient #1's request. Paramedic D called the CAH's ED and notified them that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and medical condition. During Patient #1's transport to the CAH, Patient #1 experienced ""pressure"" and ""contractions"" in the ambulance.

When the ambulance arrived at the CAH, the CAH staff instructed the EMS staff to divert the ambulance to Hospital A, as the CAH staff had closed the Obstetric (OB) unit. Patient #1 experienced contractions lasting less than 1 minute at 10:05 PM (23 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), 10:07 PM (25 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), and 10:10 PM (28 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

The ambulance containing Patient #1 presented to Hospital A at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 (31 minutes after presenting to the CAH). ED Physician H examined Patient #1 at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 and documented that Patient #1's water broke before 37 weeks of Patient #1's pregnancy (placing Patient #1's baby's life in jeopardy). ED Physician H consulted with ED Physician I at Hospital B, who agreed to accept Patient #1 for continued care. The ED staff at Hospital A transferred Patient #1 to Hospital B via a separate ambulance on 4/12/21 at 12:59 AM (137 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).


3. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 9:10 AM, Paramedic D revealed they went to Patient #1's home in response to a 911 call. Upon the arrival of Paramedic D's ambulance at Patient #1's house, Paramedic D assessed Patient #1. During the assessment, Patient #1 revealed they received their normal care at the CAH. Based on Patient #1 receiving their care at the CAH, Paramedic D instructed the other EMS crew members to transport Patient #1 to the CAH.

Approximately 5 minutes prior to the ambulance arriving at the CAH, Paramedic D called the CAH and notified the CAH ED staff that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and current medical status. The CAH ED staff indicated the ED staff would see Patient #1 when the ambulance arrived at the CAH.

Upon the ambulance's arrival at the ED, Paramedic F (who worked at the CAH) informed the EMS crew that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services and the EMS crew should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A, as Patient #1 had an obstetrical chief complaint. Per Paramedic F's instructions, Paramedic D instructed the EMS crew to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A. During the transport from the CAH to Hospital A, Patient #1 began experiencing increasing contractions.

4. During an interview on 5/12/21 at 1:35 PM, Ambulance Driver A revealed that they picked Patient #1 up at Patient #1's home. Paramedic D informed Ambulance Driver A to transport Patient #1 to the CAH. Upon arrival at the CAH, Paramedic F approached Ambulance Driver A and asked why the ambulance was at the CAH. Paramedic F (who worked for the CAH) informed Ambulance Driver A that the CAH did not have obstetrical services. Ambulance Driver A instructed Paramedic F to speak to Paramedic D about Patient #1. After Paramedic F spoke with Paramedic D, Paramedic D instructed Ambulance Driver A to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A.

Based on interviews, review of the facility's Labor and Delivery Logbook, medical record review, and review of facility policies, it was determined the facility failed to ensure stabilizing medical treatment was provided for two (2) of twenty (20) sampled patients (Patient #1 and Patient #3) that presented to the facility's Labor and Delivery Department for an Emergency Medical Condition.  Interviews revealed Patient #1 and Patient #3 presented to Labor and Delivery on 06/14/17 with complaints of questionable labor.    

Patient #1 presented at thirty (30) weeks gestation, gravida 6, para 4 (six pregnancies with four live births) with possible rupture of membranes (clear fluid leaking from vaginal area).  Patient #1 was provided a medical screening exam by Registered Nurse (RN) #1 and informed she had ruptured membranes and was dilated one (1) centimeter (cm).  RN #1 contacted the Obstetrician (OB) on call (Physician #1) and informed him of Patient #1's condition.  Physician #1 directed RN #1 to discharge Patient #1 to go to Facility #2 (78 miles away) in a private vehicle because Facility #2 is where Patient #1 was followed on an outpatient basis.  Patient #1 was discharged    at 11:42 PM on 06/14/17.  Patient #1 went by private vehicle to Facility #2 and was admitted on [DATE] at 1:15 AM with  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]#1 to Facility #3 due to Facility #2 only having a Level I Nursery.  Facility #2 transferred Patient #1 on 06/15/17 at 3:16 AM via ambulance to Facility #3.  Facility #3 admitted     Patient #1 on 06/15/17 with a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]#3 was still treating Patient #1 and Baby Boy #1 as of the date of this investigation.

Patient #3 presented to Facility #1 on 06/14/17 at thirty-five (35) weeks gestation, gravida 3, para 2 (three pregnancies with 2 live births).  Patient #3 received a medical screening exam from RN #1 and was informed that she was dilated two to three (2 to 3) cm with effacement of sixty (60) percent.  RN #1 contacted Physician #1 and was given orders to discharge Patient #3 to Facility #2 (78 miles away) in a private vehicle where the patient had been followed on an outpatient basis.  Facility #2 admitted     Patient #3 on 06/15/17 with  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  Facility #2 discharged    Patient #3 on 06/17/17.    

The findings include:

Review of the facility's policy titled ""EMTALA-Stabilization,"" reviewed 10/14/08, revealed the facility was to provide such medical treatment as was necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition was likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer of the individual from the facility; or, with respect to a pregnant woman who was having contractions and who cannot be transferred before delivery without a threat to the health and safety of the woman or unborn child, that the woman has delivered the child and the placenta.    

Review of the facility's policy titled ""EMTALA-Transfer,"" reviewed 10/14/08, revealed the facility provided further medical examination and treatment, including hospitalization  , if necessary, as required to stabilize the medical condition within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital; or to transfer to another more appropriate or specialized facility after provision of treatment necessary to minimize the risks to the health of the individual or, in the case of a pregnant female, to the unborn child.  Further review of the policy revealed any legally responsible person acting on the patient's behalf must first be fully informed of the risks of a transfer, the alternatives to transfer, and of the facility's obligations to provide further examination and treatment sufficient to stabilize the patient's Emergency Medical Condition or by a physician's order with the appropriate physician certification.  The policy stated that to provide an appropriate transfer the following was required:  the transferring facility must within its capability provide treatment to minimize the risks to the health of the individual or unborn child; the receiving facility must have available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual and must have agreed to accept the transfer and provide appropriate treatment; and the transferring facility must send copies of all available medical records pertaining to the individual's emergency condition to the facility where the patient is being transferred.

Review of the credentialing file for Physician #1 on 06/26/17 at 2:00 PM revealed Physician #1 was appointed privileges on 11/02/76 and reappointed on 11/01/16; however, there was no documented evidence the facility oriented/educated Physician #1 on their EMTALA policies.    

Review of the Labor and Delivery Logbook revealed Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 11:00 PM with a chief complaint of questionable rupture of membranes (her water broke).  Continued review of the logbook revealed Patient #1 was discharged    on [DATE] at 11:55 PM with a disposition of ""home to go to [Facility #2].""  Further review of the Labor and Delivery logbook revealed Patient #3 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:55 PM with a chief complaint of questionable labor.  Patient #3 was discharged    at 12:00 AM on 06/15/17 with a disposition of ""home to go to [Facility #2].""

1.  Review of Patient #1's medical record revealed the facility received Patient #1 on 06/14/17 with a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  RN #1 documented Patient #1 had ruptured membranes (clear fluid seen leaking from vagina), with no bleeding, dilation of one (1) centimeter (cm), effacement"" thick,"" and station -2.  Continued review of the record revealed RN #1 had documented at 11:30 PM a phone call to Physician #1.  RN #1 documented that she informed Physician #1 that Patient #1 had been on the monitor for fifteen (15) minutes and that the patient was at 30.5 weeks gestation, gravida 6, para 4.  RN #1 stated that she had performed a medical screening exam and that the patient had a clear fluid observed trickling from her vagina with a nitrozine level of 7.5.    

Further review of Patient #1's medical record revealed RN #1 documented that Physician #1 stated, ""I think the best thing to do is discharge [Patient #1] and tell her to go on to [Facility #2] where she had planned to deliver to her regular doctor.""  RN #1 then documented that she asked Physician #1, ""Do you want to transfer her to [Facility #2]?""  Physician #1 stated, ""No, [Patient #1] is not having contractions and she is only dilated to one (1) centimeter.  It will be faster to discharge her and instruct her to go on her own.""  Again RN #1 stated, ""[Patient #1's] water is broke, do you want to transfer her?  We can try to get an ambulance if you call and get an accepting doctor.""  RN #1 documented that Physician #1 stated, ""No, tell her to go on over there now, we don't have a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] here and we can't keep a 30-week baby; it will be better to just go on down there where her regular doctor is.""  RN #1 then documented that she stated to Physician #1, ""I want to clarify with you that you know [Patient #1] is at 30 weeks and her water is broke and that you told me to discharge her and instruct her to go to [Facility #2]?""  Physician #1 stated, ""Yes, she is not contracting, discharge her now and tell her to go to her regular doctor and hospital.""  Facility #1 discharged    Patient #1 at 11:55 PM.

Interview with RN #1 on 06/26/17 at 3:30 PM revealed that she was working in Labor and Delivery on 06/14/17 and conducted the medical screening exam on Patient #1.  RN #1 stated she checked Patient #1 when she first arrived and the patient was dilated to one (1) centimeter at that time.  RN #1 stated that Patient #1 came in with a ""towel between her legs and clear fluid leaking from her vagina.""  RN #1 stated that Patient #1 had ruptured membranes and she was very concerned because Patient #1 was only at 30 weeks gestation.  RN #1 stated, ""We always transfer patients like her, we never discharge them.""  RN #1 stated that when she contacted Physician #1, she expected to receive a transfer order and when she did not, she stated she questioned Physician #1 for ""several minutes.""  RN #1 stated once she hung up with Physician #1, she contacted the House Supervisor because she did not agree with Physician #1's order for Patient #1.  RN #1 stated the House Supervisor instructed her to contact the OB Manager.  Continued interview with RN #1 revealed that the OB Manager instructed her to follow Physician #1's orders.  RN #1 stated she then discharged    Patient #1 from the facility.    

Interview with the OB Manager on 06/26/17 at 12:00 PM revealed that she was contacted by RN #1 on 06/14/17 regarding Patient #1.  The OB Manager stated that she did instruct RN #1 to follow Physician #1's orders.  Continued interview with the OB Manager revealed that she stated she thought about the situation for a few minutes and then contacted the House Supervisor so she could contact the Administrator on Call for direction.  The OB Manager stated she then contacted RN #1 but by that time, Patient #1 had been discharged    from the facility.  The OB Manager stated that a patient with those circumstances should never be discharged   , they should be monitored and transferred.    

Interview with Physician #1 on 06/26/17 at 1:21 PM revealed he was the on-call OB on 06/14/17 for Facility #1.  Physician #1 stated that he did speak with RN #1 regarding Patient #1.  Physician #1 stated that Facility #1 did not have the capability to care for a 30-week newborn and that he was ""saving"" time when he gave the order to discharge rather than to transfer.  Physician #1 stated that sometimes it takes hours to have an ambulance respond to a request to transport a patient to another facility and he did not want to take the chance of the baby being delivered at Facility #1.  Further interview with Physician #1 revealed that he thought Facility #2 had a Level II NICU nursery to provide care for the newborn baby.  Physician #1 stated that because Patient #1 was only dilated to 1 centimeter and not contracting, he felt it was safe to discharge her by private vehicle and go on her own to Facility #2.    

Interview with Physician #2 on 06/26/17 at 5:00 PM revealed he was the Medical Director for the OB unit at Facility #1.  Physician #2 stated that given the set of circumstances surrounding Patient #1, he professionally would not have discharged    the patient.  He stated that he would have transferred her via ambulance to another facility.  Further interview with Physician #2 revealed that had the Administrator on Call contacted him regarding this situation, he would have instructed RN #1 to follow Physician #1's orders because Physician #1 was his partner and it was difficult to go against his medical opinion.    

Review of Patient #1's medical record from Facility #2 revealed the facility admitted     Patient #1 on 06/15/17 at 1:15 AM with  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]#1 to Facility #3 due to Facility #2 only having a Level I Nursery.  Facility #2 transferred Patient #1 on 06/15/17 at 3:16 AM via ambulance to Facility #3.    

Facility #3 admitted     Patient #1 on 06/15/17 with a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]#3 was still treating Patient #1 and Baby Boy #1 as of the date of the investigation.  Patient #1's baby boy was diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]'s response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs), Feeding problems of a newborn, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] status post surfactant (a syndrome in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs; it can also be a consequence of neonatal infection), and Hypotension (low blood pressure).    

2.  Review of the medical record for Patient #3 revealed Facility #1 admitted     the patient on 06/14/17 at 10:55 PM with a chief complaint of questionable labor.

Interview with Physician #1 on 06/26/17 at 1:21 PM revealed he was the on-call OB on 06/14/17 for Facility #1.  Physician #1 stated that he did speak with RN #1 regarding Patient #3.  Physician #1 stated that he recalled that Patient #3 was a term pregnancy and the baby was in a breech position.  Physician #1 stated that from the information that RN #1 told him he was unsure if Patient #3 was in labor and he gave orders to discharge Patient #3 to home and for her to go to Facility #2 where her OB delivered babies and for her to follow up with them.  Physician #1 stated that he felt like he gave orders that were in the best interest of the baby.    

Interview with the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) and the Risk Manager on 06/26/17 at 3:30 PM revealed that they became aware of the incident on 06/15/17 when they were contacted by Facility #2.  The Risk Manager stated that Physician #1 should have transferred Patient #1 and Patient #3 rather than discharging them.  The CNO and the Risk Manager stated that on 06/19/17 all OB staff was re-educated on EMTALA policies and on 06/21/17 all Providers were re-educated on EMTALA policies and procedures.  Physician #1 and Physician #2 were educated separately on 06/26/17 and Facility #1 held a Medical Staff Meeting on 06/26/17 where the Chief Executive Officer, the CNO, and the Risk Manager spoke regarding EMTALA policies and procedures to the entire medical staff.

Again RN #1 stated, ""[Patient #1's] water is broke, do you want to transfer her?  We can try to get an ambulance if you call and get an accepting doctor.""  RN #1 documented that Physician #1 stated, ""No, tell her to go on over there now, we don't have a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] here and we can't keep a 30-week baby; it will be better to just go on down there where her regular doctor is.""  RN #1 then documented that she stated to Physician #1, ""I want to clarify with you that you know [Patient #1] is at 30 weeks and her water is broke and that you told me to discharge her and instruct her to go to [Facility #2]?""

I usually do ask that, but I didn't this time.  [He/she] [pt's. spouse] did all the talking and said their doctor had sent them in to be checked and that they were 'going to have a baby today'.  [He/she] [Patient #61] didn't appear in any distress and didn't have a suitcase.

Employee #8 stated that multiple OB staff were off-site attending a mandatory education session and that the department was on divert for ""most of the weekend"".  

Based on information obtained during these interviews this divert mechanism was unique to the OB department and was utilized ""if we don't have enough nursing staff"".  Employee #8 stated during this interview, ""Any OB patient who presents to the hospital, even if we're on divert, would be evaluated and treated as needed"".  Both employees stated ""We just make it work"".  Employee #8 stated, ""We have to take whoever comes through the door.  We just have to figure out how to take care of them"".

During an interview with Employee #3 on 5/13/2015 at 8:30 AM he/she stated that he/she received a call from Registration personnel on 5/4/2015 informing him/her that there was an OB patient in their office ""who looks like she's wanting to check-in.  [He/she] [Patient #61]looks like [he/she] might be in labor and [he/she] doesn't speak any English. I told them I needed to talk to the CRN and would call them back.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to demonstrate adequate MSE's by qualified RN's for 9 of 53 sampled patients (Patients 1, 3, 5, 16, 18, 20).  The MSE is an ongoing process initiated in the facility's ED by the MSE qualified RN to determine if a medical emergency exists and to assign the patient to the appropriate ESI level.  An inadequate MSE performed by the qualified RN may result in an ESI level that does not accurately reflect the immediate needs of the patient.   

Findings:

1.  On 11/03/14 at 3:27 AM, Patient-1 walked into the ED with a chief complaint of 10/10 right knee pain.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE by RN-10 showed the following :  ""Subjective: chronic right knee pain and has appt (appointment)today but wants to see ER  MD for pain..., Objective: speaking in clear full sentences, ambulatory with steady gait with cane..., Pain: patient complains of pain described as, on a scale 0-10 rates pain as 10, Location right knee..., Medical History: Past medical history is not significant..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI of 4.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 9:46 AM,  RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments that would indicate whether the right knee had swelling or redness and she would palpate the knee as well as compare the affected extremity with the left knee.  She would also assess for numbness or tingling.  Additionally, she would ask the patient if he took medications to alleviate the pain.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed.  

Video record review on 4/02/15 at 10:38 AM showed the patient calmly stayed in the ED waiting area for approximately 30 minutes waiting his turn to see the physician when RN-9 requested the Deputy Sheriff to remove Patient-1 from the ED without consulting with the patient first.   RN-10 documented on 11/03/14 at 4:24 AM, ""Pt (patient)abusive to RN and reg (regular)staff.  Verbal altercation w (with)IP (Institutional Police)results in arrest"".  The patient was removed from the ED without further evaluation from a physician. 
 
During an interview on 4/02/15 at 11:54 AM, the ED Director stated with patients with ESI levels of 4 or 5, the MSE qualified RN may refer patients to the outpatient clinics.  The ED Director stated RN-9 and RN-10 should have reassessed and included the patient in the decision making process with the change of care and plan rather than deciding on their own to have the patient removed by the Deputy Sheriff.  

The facility's policy titled, ""Medical Screening - Emergency Department Medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"", date last reviewed 7/13, date last revised 10/09, defined ESI Level 4 and 5 as the following:  ""Individuals who are ESI Level 4 and 5 may have the following dispositions: i. After an MSE, the patient may be referred to a health clinic or urgent care center if an emergency medical condition does not exist, ii. Or the patient may remain in the ED for physical evaluation, treatment, and disposition..."".

2.  On 11/30/14  at 5:17 AM, Patient -3 had a chief complaint of 8/10 left kidney pain.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE showed the following: ""Subjective: Per pt(patient), she has had pain in her left kidney since last night.  Woke up this AM and had burning during urination..., Objective: crying, cooperative, steady gait, MAE (moves all extremities), ABD (abdomen)non tender..., Pertinent negatives: trauma, hematuria, N/V (nausea/vomiting), ABD (abdominal)pain..., Pain: Patient complains of pain described as, burning, on a scale 0-10 patient rates pain as 8, Location L (left)flank lower back, pain is constant..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI level of 3.  The medical record showed the RN referred the patient to the urgent care clinic at 8:04 AM and was not evaluated by the ED MD.  The patient was not assigned an ESI level of 4 or 5 so referring the patient to the urgent care contradicts the referral policy since the patient had an ESI level of 3.  

The facility's policy, ""Medical Screening - Department medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"", date last reviewed 7/13, date last revised 10/09, defined ESI level 3 as follows: ""...Triage- ESI Level 3 is a time order given to patients that may have an emergency medical condition that requires two or more resources in order for a patient disposition to be made.  Resources may include hospital services, tests, procedures, consults, and interventions...,  Individuals who are ESI Level 1, ESI Level 2, and ESI Level 3 will remain in the ED for physician evaluation, treatment, stabilization, and disposition..."".

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:00 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments such as a back exam, labs such as a urinalysis and pregnancy test.  She would also have considered starting an IV.  RN-8  agreed that the patient should not have been referred out with an ESI level of 3 and that it was not standardized procedure.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed.

3. On 12/03/14 at 11:38 PM, Patient-5 walked into the ED with a chief complaint of 5/10 right side abdominal pain for one day and was 21 weeks pregnant.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE showed the following: ""Subjective: Right sided abdominal pain x1 day.  21 weeks pregnant..., Objective: alert, conscious, oriented x3. Skin pwd (pink, warm, dry).  Ambulates with steady gait.  Respirations even and unlabored, speaking in full and complete sentences..., Pain: No complaints of pain..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI level of 3 and was referred to the L&D.

During an interview on 4/08/15 at 11:38 AM, the Nurse Manager reviewed the chart and stated he would expect the RN to clarify if there was a change in the pain status since the documentation showed ""no complaints of pain"" for this patient who had a presenting pain level of 5/10.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:16 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments regarding contractions and vaginal bleeding.

The medical record showed Patient-5 returned to the ED on 12/06/14 at 7:55 AM with a chief complaint of bilateral leg swelling and 6/10 right knee pain for 13 days.  Record review of the RN MSE did not show an objective assessment on the legs and knee.  The patient was assigned an ESI level of 3 and was referred to the L&D unit.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:00 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have assessed the patient's legs and knee for swelling, redness and range of motion.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed. 

The facility's policy titled, ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)"", administrative policy number 5.02, revised date 9/13, documented the following: ""... A medical screening examination is the process required to reach, within reasonable confidence, whether an emergency medical condition does or does not exist.  The scope and location of the examination must be tailored to the presenting complaint and medical history of the patient.  The process may range from a simple examination (such as a brief history and/or physical) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests..."".  

The facility's policy titled, ""Appendix B to 5.2 EMTALA, Medical Screening Examination"" (undated), showed the following:  ""Protocol: Medical Screening Examination, A. Definition: This protocol covers the medical screening examination (MSE) performed in the Emergency Department (ED). The MSE is an examination performed by the physicians, or qualified registered Nurse, on all patients who present to the ED seeking care.  The examination, viewed as an ongoing process, may range from a brief to a detailed examination involving all the laboratory, x-ray, and consultative resources available with SFGHMC's range of services, so that it is possible to reasonably determine whether an emergency medical condition exists or not, B. Data Base: 1. Subjective data: Statement of chief complaint, Patient history, and signs and symptoms relevant to disease process/injury and organ systems affected, Pain assessment to include and intensity (1-10 scale), Pertinent past medical history, medications, and allergies, Current immunization status for children and adults with surface trauma, Any treatments used to arrival, 2. Objective Data: Limited physical exam appropriate to disease process/injury, Level of consciousness (may use Glasgow Coma Scale), Vital signs, Skin signs, Emotional state, Physical appearance, size and location of injuries, with assessment of distal circulation, movement and sensation, as appropriate, Ability to ambulate and assessment of gait, as appropriate, Assessment of symptoms of pregnancy or possible labor, including term of gestation, as appropriate, Disease and age appropriate and radiological studies..."".

The medical screening class outline for the ED RN's dated 6/10 documented the following: ""The triage nurse has the purpose to determine whether patients have an emergency medical condition, and if one exists to assign the patient to the appropriate triage category..., Perform the MSE by obtaining specific subjective and objective data from the patient or patient representative..., Objective data include a limited physical exam appropriate to the disease or injury..."".



 

4. Patient 16 - During record review on 4/8/15 at 11:30 AM, it was noted that Patient 16 came to the ED on 10/7/14 and was assigned an ESI (Emergency Severity Index) score of  Level 3. 

The hospital's policy and procedure titled ""Medical Screening - Emergency Department Medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"" dated 7/13, stated ""Individuals who are ESI Level 1, ESI Level 2, and ESI Level 3 will remain in the ED for physician evaluation, treatment, stabilization, and disposition.""

Review of RN 4's notes indicated she had written ""Medical screening exam completed"" at 9:34 PM on 10/7/15.  There were no notes written by the ED physician.

Review of the MSE nurse's Notes (RN 4)  indicated that after she did the MSE RN 4 made arrangements for Patient 16 to go to a Sobering Center.  Patient 16 agreed to this plan, and RN 4 released Patient 16 to the care of the local police to transport him to the Sobering Center at 10:42 PM on 10/7/15..

On 4/8/15 at 11:40 AM, RN 1 confirmed that Patient 16 was an ESI Level 3 and should not have been released from the ED without being seen by the ED physician to complete the MSE.

During a group interview on 4/9/15 at 2:20 PM, the ED Nurse Manager (NM) stated  that it was a mistake to enter  the statement ""Medical screening exam completed"" in any electronic medical record (EMR)  where a physician had not seen ESI Level 1, 2 or 3 patients.  The NM explained that the MSE was a process and until the ED physician examined patients with ESI Levels of 1, 2, and 3, and examined those patients with ESI Levels of 4 and 5 who chose to wait for the physician examination, then the MSE process was not completed. 

5. Patient 18 - Record review indicated Patient 18 was admitted on [DATE] at 1:03 AM after a fall down five steps.  Patient 18 was triaged as an ESI Level 3.  The Registered Nurse (RN 5) charted ""Medical Screening Exam Completed"" at 1:05 AM on 10/11/14, even though the ED physician did not begin his examination of Patient 18 until 4:05 AM.

","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to demonstrate adequate MSE's by qualified RN's for 9 of 53 sampled patients (Patients 1, 3, 5, 16, 18, 20).  The MSE is an ongoing process initiated in the facility's ED by the MSE qualified RN to determine if a medical emergency exists and to assign the patient to the appropriate ESI level.  An inadequate MSE performed by the qualified RN may result in an ESI level that does not accurately reflect the immediate needs of the patient.   

Findings:

1.  On 11/03/14 at 3:27 AM, Patient-1 walked into the ED with a chief complaint of 10/10 right knee pain.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE by RN-10 showed the following :  ""Subjective: chronic right knee pain and has appt (appointment)today but wants to see ER  MD for pain..., Objective: speaking in clear full sentences, ambulatory with steady gait with cane..., Pain: patient complains of pain described as, on a scale 0-10 rates pain as 10, Location right knee..., Medical History: Past medical history is not significant..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI of 4.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 9:46 AM,  RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments that would indicate whether the right knee had swelling or redness and she would palpate the knee as well as compare the affected extremity with the left knee.  She would also assess for numbness or tingling.  Additionally, she would ask the patient if he took medications to alleviate the pain.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed.  

Video record review on 4/02/15 at 10:38 AM showed the patient calmly stayed in the ED waiting area for approximately 30 minutes waiting his turn to see the physician when RN-9 requested the Deputy Sheriff to remove Patient-1 from the ED without consulting with the patient first.   RN-10 documented on 11/03/14 at 4:24 AM, ""Pt (patient)abusive to RN and reg (regular)staff.  Verbal altercation w (with)IP (Institutional Police)results in arrest"".  The patient was removed from the ED without further evaluation from a physician. 
 
During an interview on 4/02/15 at 11:54 AM, the ED Director stated with patients with ESI levels of 4 or 5, the MSE qualified RN may refer patients to the outpatient clinics.  The ED Director stated RN-9 and RN-10 should have reassessed and included the patient in the decision making process with the change of care and plan rather than deciding on their own to have the patient removed by the Deputy Sheriff.  

The facility's policy titled, ""Medical Screening - Emergency Department Medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"", date last reviewed 7/13, date last revised 10/09, defined ESI Level 4 and 5 as the following:  ""Individuals who are ESI Level 4 and 5 may have the following dispositions: i. After an MSE, the patient may be referred to a health clinic or urgent care center if an emergency medical condition does not exist, ii. Or the patient may remain in the ED for physical evaluation, treatment, and disposition..."".

2.  On 11/30/14  at 5:17 AM, Patient -3 had a chief complaint of 8/10 left kidney pain.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE showed the following: ""Subjective: Per pt(patient), she has had pain in her left kidney since last night.  Woke up this AM and had burning during urination..., Objective: crying, cooperative, steady gait, MAE (moves all extremities), ABD (abdomen)non tender..., Pertinent negatives: trauma, hematuria, N/V (nausea/vomiting), ABD (abdominal)pain..., Pain: Patient complains of pain described as, burning, on a scale 0-10 patient rates pain as 8, Location L (left)flank lower back, pain is constant..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI level of 3.  The medical record showed the RN referred the patient to the urgent care clinic at 8:04 AM and was not evaluated by the ED MD.  The patient was not assigned an ESI level of 4 or 5 so referring the patient to the urgent care contradicts the referral policy since the patient had an ESI level of 3.  

The facility's policy, ""Medical Screening - Department medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"", date last reviewed 7/13, date last revised 10/09, defined ESI level 3 as follows: ""...Triage- ESI Level 3 is a time order given to patients that may have an emergency medical condition that requires two or more resources in order for a patient disposition to be made.  Resources may include hospital services, tests, procedures, consults, and interventions...,  Individuals who are ESI Level 1, ESI Level 2, and ESI Level 3 will remain in the ED for physician evaluation, treatment, stabilization, and disposition..."".

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:00 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments such as a back exam, labs such as a urinalysis and .  She would also have considered starting an IV.  RN-8  agreed that the patient should not have been referred out with an ESI level of 3 and that it was not standardized procedure.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed.

3. On 12/03/14 at 11:38 PM, Patient-5 walked into the ED with a chief complaint of 5/10 right side abdominal pain for one day and was 21 weeks pregnant.  Pertaining to the chief complaint, the RN MSE showed the following: ""Subjective: Right sided abdominal pain x1 day.  21 weeks pregnant..., Objective: alert, conscious, oriented x3. Skin pwd (pink, warm, dry).  Ambulates with steady gait.  Respirations even and unlabored, speaking in full and complete sentences..., Pain: No complaints of pain..."".  The RN assigned the patient an ESI level of 3 and was referred to the L&D.

During an interview on 4/08/15 at 11:38 AM, the Nurse Manager reviewed the chart and stated he would expect the RN to clarify if there was a change in the pain status since the documentation showed ""no complaints of pain"" for this patient who had a presenting pain level of 5/10.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:16 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have considered additional assessments regarding contractions and vaginal bleeding.

The medical record showed Patient-5 returned to the ED on 12/06/14 at 7:55 AM with a chief complaint of bilateral leg swelling and 6/10 right knee pain for 13 days.  Record review of the RN MSE did not show an objective assessment on the legs and knee.  The patient was assigned an ESI level of 3 and was referred to the L&D unit.

During an interview on 4/10/15 at 10:00 AM, RN-8 who is an MSE qualified RN, reviewed the chart and stated she would have assessed the patient's legs and knee for swelling, redness and range of motion.  The Nurse Manager who was present during the chart review acknowledged that additional information was also needed. 

The facility's policy titled, ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)"", administrative policy number 5.02, revised date 9/13, documented the following: ""... A medical screening examination is the process required to reach, within reasonable confidence, whether an emergency medical condition does or does not exist.  The scope and location of the examination must be tailored to the presenting complaint and medical history of the patient.  The process may range from a simple examination (such as a brief history and/or physical) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests..."".  

The facility's policy titled, ""Appendix B to 5.2 EMTALA, Medical Screening Examination"" (undated), showed the following:  ""Protocol: Medical Screening Examination, A. Definition: This protocol covers the medical screening examination (MSE) performed in the Emergency Department (ED). The MSE is an examination performed by the physicians, or qualified registered Nurse, on all patients who present to the ED seeking care.  The examination, viewed as an ongoing process, may range from a brief to a detailed examination involving all the laboratory, x-ray, and consultative resources available with SFGHMC's range of services, so that it is possible to reasonably determine whether an emergency medical condition exists or not, B. Data Base: 1. Subjective data: Statement of chief complaint, Patient history, and signs and symptoms relevant to disease process/injury and organ systems affected, Pain assessment to include and intensity (1-10 scale), Pertinent past medical history, medications, and allergies, Current immunization status for children and adults with surface trauma, Any treatments used to arrival, 2.

The medical screening class outline for the ED RN's dated 6/10 documented the following: ""The triage nurse has the purpose to determine whether patients have an emergency medical condition, and if one exists to assign the patient to the appropriate triage category..., Perform the MSE by obtaining specific subjective and objective data from the patient or patient representative..., Objective data include a limited physical exam appropriate to the disease or injury..."".



 

4. Patient 16 - During record review on 4/8/15 at 11:30 AM, it was noted that Patient 16 came to the ED on 10/7/14 and was assigned an ESI (Emergency Severity Index) score of  Level 3. 

The hospital's policy and procedure titled ""Medical Screening - Emergency Department Medical Screening and Triage Guidelines"" dated 7/13, stated ""Individuals who are ESI Level 1, ESI Level 2, and ESI Level 3 will remain in the ED for physician evaluation, treatment, stabilization, and disposition.""

Review of RN 4's notes indicated she had written ""Medical screening exam completed"" at 9:34 PM on 10/7/15.  There were no notes written by the ED physician.

Review of the MSE nurse's Notes (RN 4)  indicated that after she did the MSE RN 4 made arrangements for Patient 16 to go to a Sobering Center.  Patient 16 agreed to this plan, and RN 4 released Patient 16 to the care of the local police to transport him to the Sobering Center at 10:42 PM on 10/7/15..

On 4/8/15 at 11:40 AM, RN 1 confirmed that Patient 16 was an ESI Level 3 and should not have been released from the ED without being seen by the ED physician to complete the MSE.

During a group interview on 4/9/15 at 2:20 PM, the ED Nurse Manager (NM) stated  that it was a mistake to enter  the statement ""Medical screening exam completed"" in any electronic medical record (EMR)  where a physician had not seen ESI Level 1, 2 or 3 patients.  The NM explained that the MSE was a process and until the ED physician examined patients with ESI Levels of 1, 2, and 3, and examined those patients with ESI Levels of 4 and 5 who chose to wait for the physician examination, then the MSE process was not completed. 

5. Patient 18 - Record review indicated Patient 18 was admitted on [DATE] at 1:03 AM after a fall down five steps.  Patient 18 was triaged as an ESI Level 3.

Based on interview, record review, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24 Special Responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases for two (2) of twenty-one (21) patients that presented to the facility extension Emergency Department (ED), Patients #1 and #20.  The facility extension failed to ensure a medical screening examination (MSE) was provided for Patient #1 on 01/12/13 after he/she was brought to their ambulance bay for treatment of a possible emergency medical condition. The facility extension failed to ensure an appropriate transfer was accomplished on 07/30/12 for Patient #20 when he/she was transferred to an external psychiatric facility. 

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who will investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.  Additionally, the policy revealed patients transferred to an external psychiatric facility must have a transfer form completed by the Physician, Social Worker (if applicable), and Nurse.  The policy further revealed the patient must be medically and psychiatrically stable before being transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  It stated the attending Physician, in consultation with the Psychiatrist would prepare a referral with the signature of the consulting Psychiatrist, and if the patient was seen on an emergent basis, the ED records would be copied and  transferred with the patient.  It further revealed the Physician would determine the appropriate mode of transport, the supervision required, and the patient's medical condition, and in the ED, the nursing staff would arrange for the transport.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting,"" policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

1. Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Observation of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.  

2.  Review of Patient #20's ED record revealed he/she arrived at the facility extension ED on 07/30/12 at 2:51 AM with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made and was escorted by law enforcement.  The Physician ED note listed unremarkable vital signs and negative/noncontributory review of systems.  It also listed a Psychiatric consult was done, a urine drug screen was presumptively positive, and the patient had an appropriate mood and behavior.  Patient #20 was transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  There was no documentation the receiving psychiatric facility had agreed to accept the transfer, had been sent the required hospital records, or that the patient had been transported appropriately and safely to the receiving psychiatric facility. The record revealed there was no facility transfer form.

Interview with the Enterprise ED Director and the facility RN ED Manager, on 01/31/13 at 4:25 PM, revealed both stated the facility extension ED had not been completing transfer forms that had required information for ED patients transferred to an external facility since 2010 when personnel were told they did not have to complete the transfer forms for an intra-facility transfer, (transfer from the facility to the facility extension.)  They both stated, at this point, the staff stopped completing any transfer forms for any patients, no matter where they were being transferred.  They further revealed the problem was discovered during an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Validation Survey conducted 01/14/13 through 01/18/13 and since the problem was identified, the facility had started completing transfer forms (one to go with patient and one to stay in ED record)  for patients transferred outside the facility system.

Confirmation of the facility extension completing a transfer form was accomplished by review of a closed ED record, Patient #9, which revealed he/she was seen in the facility extension ED on 01/27/13 with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made.  The record revealed this patient was transferred on 01/27/13 to an external psychiatric facility.  The record also revealed it contained a ""Transfer Agreement"" that listed the medical condition of the patient, the reason for transfer, the approval of the receiving facility for transfer, the Physician accepting transfer, who received the patient report at the receiving facility, the transfer method, and treatment information.  This form must be signed by the Discharging Nurse.  This form also has a section for transfer of unstable patients with the required Physician completion and signature.







","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview, record review, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24 Special Responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases for two (2) of twenty-one (21) patients that presented to the facility extension Emergency Department (ED), Patients #1 and #20.  The facility extension failed to ensure a medical screening examination (MSE) was provided for Patient #1 on 01/12/13 after he/she was brought to their ambulance bay for treatment of a possible emergency medical condition. The facility extension failed to ensure an appropriate transfer was accomplished on 07/30/12 for Patient #20 when he/she was transferred to an external psychiatric facility. 

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who will investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.  Additionally, the policy revealed patients transferred to an external psychiatric facility must have a transfer form completed by the Physician, Social Worker (if applicable), and Nurse.  The policy further revealed the patient must be medically and psychiatrically stable before being transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  It stated the attending Physician, in consultation with the Psychiatrist would prepare a referral with the signature of the consulting Psychiatrist, and if the patient was seen on an emergent basis, the ED records would be copied and  transferred with the patient.  It further revealed the Physician would determine the appropriate mode of transport, the supervision required, and the patient's medical condition, and in the ED, the nursing staff would arrange for the transport.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting,"" policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

1. Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.

Observation of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.

Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.  

2.  Review of Patient #20's ED record revealed he/she arrived at the facility extension ED on 07/30/12 at 2:51 AM with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made and was escorted by law enforcement.  The Physician ED note listed unremarkable vital signs and negative/noncontributory review of systems.  It also listed a Psychiatric consult was done, a urine drug screen was presumptively positive, and the patient had an appropriate mood and behavior.  Patient #20 was transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  There was no documentation the receiving psychiatric facility had agreed to accept the transfer, had been sent the required hospital records, or that the patient had been transported appropriately and safely to the receiving psychiatric facility. The record revealed there was no facility transfer form.

Interview with the Enterprise ED Director and the facility RN ED Manager, on 01/31/13 at 4:25 PM, revealed both stated the facility extension ED had not been completing transfer forms that had required information for ED patients transferred to an external facility since 2010 when personnel were told they did not have to complete the transfer forms for an intra-facility transfer, (transfer from the facility to the facility extension.)  They both stated, at this point, the staff stopped completing any transfer forms for any patients, no matter where they were being transferred.  They further revealed the problem was discovered during an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Validation Survey conducted 01/14/13 through 01/18/13 and since the problem was identified, the facility had started completing transfer forms (one to go with patient and one to stay in ED record)  for patients transferred outside the facility system.

Confirmation of the facility extension completing a transfer form was accomplished by review of a closed ED record, Patient #9, which revealed he/she was seen in the facility extension ED on 01/27/13 with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made.  The record revealed this patient was transferred on 01/27/13 to an external psychiatric facility.  The record also revealed it contained a ""Transfer Agreement"" that listed the medical condition of the patient, the reason for transfer, the approval of the receiving facility for transfer, the Physician accepting transfer, who received the patient report at the receiving facility, the transfer method, and treatment information.  This form must be signed by the Discharging Nurse.  This form also has a section for transfer of unstable patients with the required Physician completion and signature.

Based on medical record reviews, interviews, review of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor) Policies and Procedures, emergency room    Policies and Procedures, Wiregrass Medical Center, Hospital # 1, failed to provide a medical screening examination for Patient Identifier (PI) # 1, a patient who presented to the ED (emergency department) with complaints of ""Cramping, Bleeding, Pregnant,"" on 6/12/17.  Furthermore, the ER  RN (emergency room    Registered Nurse) told the patient (PI # 1) no obstetrical services were available at Hospital # 1 before offering a thorough triage assessment to PI # 1.  The RN also advised PI # 1 to go to Enterprise(the name of the city where Hospital # 2) is located.  These comments / ""suggestions"" by the RN contributed to the decision of PI # 1 to leave the ER  at Hospital # 1 without being thoroughly triaged or receiving a medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.   

This deficient practice effected PI #1, one of 32 ED sampled patients and had the potential to negatively impact other patients who present to Hospital #1's Emergency Department with similar obstetrical symptoms. 

Finding include:

I. Hospital # 1's ER  Log dated 6/12/17 documented:

There was no documentation of a Medical Screening Examination in PI # 1's ER  medical record.     

III. Interviews

Interview with EI # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1 on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58:

During an interview on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58,  Employee Identifier (EI) # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) / ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1, verified she was on duty on 6/12/17 from 18:00-06:00.  EI # 1 confirmed she was responsible for the triage/interview with PI # 1 in the ED lobby. 

EI # 1 reported events of the ED activities related to Patient Identifier (PI # 1) which included registration with an Admission Clerk.  The clerk took PI # 1's chart to the ED nurse's station.  EI # 1, staff ED RN was told by the Admission Clerk a 27 week pregnant lady was in the ED lobby, with complaints of cramping and bleeding (vaginal). When the staff RN opened the ED lobby door, FI # 1, (Family Identifier), the grandmother who accompanied the patient, was screaming this into a cell phone, ""I'm just gonna take her to Enterprise.""  EI # 1 confirmed no other patients were present in the ED lobby.

During the ED lobby encounter with PI # 1, the staff RN (EI # 1) reported asking the patient (PI # 1),  ""How bad are you bleeding?""  PI # 1 response, ""pretty bad.""  

EI # 1 then reported to the surveyors, ""I told PI # 1 like I tell all patients.  We'll be glad to see you, have the doctor assess you and listen to the heart beat of the baby, but Wiregrass (Hospital # 1) does not have OB/GYN services.""  EI # 1 reported asking PI # 1 where her OB physician was located?  PI # 1 reported Enterprise (name of the city where her obstetrician practices). 

EI # 1 reported PI # 1 was crying.  A family member was on the phone screaming, ""I'm just going to take her to Enterprise."" 

EI # 1 reported telling the patient ""to sit still, I'm going to get the other nurse to help.""  EI # 1 reported the patient's response as she ""shook her head (in affirmation).""
EI # 1 reported then exiting the lobby to the nurses' desk where another Staff ED RN, EI # 2 was working. 

EI # 2 reported to EI # 1, ""I guess they were going to leave,"" as EI # 2 observed the patient and another female via a computer monitor in the ED exit the ED lobby.  

EI # 1 (Staff RN, ED, responsible for triage of PI # 1) confirmed EI # 2 did not hear the conversation in the lobby with PI # 1. EI # 2 only observed the patient and family exit the ED lobby to a private vehicle in the parking lot.

EI # 1 reported the process when a patient comes to the ER.  The patient ""registers, then the ward clerk tells the RN the patient presented with chest pain or shortness of breath, one of us (RN's) physically goes out to the lobby gets the patient, brings them to a bed and triage is completed in an exam room...""  

EI # 1 reported she had planned to put PI # 1 in a wheelchair after she retrieved the chair and transfer the patient to an exam room bed where PI # 1 would be triaged and bypass the traditional triage room.

EI # 1 verbalized there was no interaction between the patient and family member and / or the nurse and family member during the initial lobby encounter. The family member, on the phone continued to scream, ""I'm just going to Enterprise.""  EI # 1 reported PI # 1 was tearing and crying like she was hurting. 

EI # 1 reported she did not visualize any blood. EI # 1 denied patient reports of  problems other than cramping and vaginal bleeding which required 1 pad change every hour. 

EI # 1 acknowledged the potential for the patient's water to break (membrane rupture).

EI # 1 reported she documented in the medical record that PI # 1 left without being seen. 

EI # 1 notified EI # 4, ED Physician at Hospital # 1, who was present in the ED when PI # 1 arrived on 6/12/17.  According to the ED Staff RN, EI # 4 responded, ""We would be more than glad to see them."" 

EI # 1 reported she had no knowledge who PI # 1's physician was, only that the physician was in Enterprise.  EI # 1 verbalized if PI # 1 had come to the back (triage), if something was wrong, she would have called the clinic, looked up PI # 1's medical history, got a release signed, faxed the paper work and could have reviewed PI # 1's obstetrical history.   

EI # 1 confirmed the triage and medical screening was not completed for PI # 1. There was no documentation an AMA (against medical advice) was obtained. There was no documentation of a conversation regarding completion of an AMA form with PI # 1 and the family member.

EI # 1 reported a written statement of the events of 6/12/17 of PI # 1's ER  visit was completed on 6/19/17 at the request of the Director Of Nurses, EI # 7.  EI # 1 confirmed the following  events were documented on the written statement:

On June 12, 2017 around 5 AM, this nurse went to check on a patient in the lobby that had registered to be seen. The patient told the ward clerk that she was 27 weeks pregnant, cramping  and bleeding. I (the nurse) went to check on the patient, and bring her back to be seen by our doctor. As I opened the door, her grandmother was on her cell phone screaming "" I'm just going to take her to Enterprise"".  I (the nurse) looked at the patient who was crying, and ""ask her who her OB GYN was?"" The patient stated ""he is in Enterprise.""  This whole time the grandmother was still on her cell phone screaming ""I'm just going to take her to Enterprise,"" the grandmother never once took the cell phone down from her ear. I (the nurse) told the patient we would be glad to have her see our doctor, examine her, and we could listen to the babies heart beat.""  I (the nurse) told the patient ""not to get up, that the nurse was going to get the other RN and a wheelchair."" I (the nurse) went back to the ER, and as I (the nurse) approached the desk, the other RN (named staff) saw them get up and leave on the video camera. He stated to the nurse (myself) ""the patient had just walked out of the hospital.""

According to FI# 1, the patient, PI # 1, told the ""receptionist"" she was bleeding and cramping and had a previous delivery at 27 weeks.  PI # 1 was crying.  

A nurse came out to the lobby and said there was nothing the hospital could do, but ""monitor FHT's (Fetal Heart Tones).  We (Hospital # 1) don't have OB."" (Obstetrical services).  FI # 1 asked the nurse if she would monitor FHT's?  According to FI # 1, the nurse replied, ""If I was ya'll, I wouldn't waste anymore time.""  We (PI # 1 and FI # 1) decided to go to Hospital # 2.  


Interview with Patient Identifier (PI # 1) on 6/28/17 at 13:50:

According to PI # 1, she arrived at Hospital # 1's ER  on 6/12/17 at 04:30.  ""I told the receptionist  I was bleeding, cramping and had a previous pregnancy at 27 weeks.  I am a high risk pregnancy.  I need to get to the back and see somebody.""  

""I was scared.  I was trying to get to the back (ED treatment area).""  A nurse (EI # 1) came out to the lobby and said the only thing she could do was check Fetal Heart Tones.  She said there was no OB/GYN (Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician) at the hospital (Hospital # 1).  She said it was best for me to go to Enterprise."" (name of city where Hospital # 2 is located).

VII. History and Physical for Baby (PI # 33 ) at Hospital # 2: 

admitted  : 6/12/17

Admission and Transfer Summary: 

Chief Complaint: Extreme prematurity at 27 weeks.

History of Present Illness: ""I was called to a C- Section this morning...for a 27 week estimated gestational age delivery.  Mom (PI # 1) had a previous C-Section (cecesarian section) - came in dilated with a bulging bag. Baby was delivered by C-Section breech presentation.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  Rupture of membranes at delivery.   The baby was limp and not breathing, had a heart rate of less than 100, but above 60.  PPV (Positive pressure ventilation: The provision of air under pressure by a mechanical respirator, a machine designed to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere, medicinenet.com) was initiated for three minutes in the C-section room with 100% oxygen.  APGARS (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) were one at one minute, 2 APGARS at 2 minutes and 7 APGARS at 5 minutes (APGAR: a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score reveals how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb, medlineplus.gov).""

""Baby was brought to the nursery...and weighed 870 grams.  The initial oxygen saturation was 85% on room air.  Blow-by was initiated and oxygen saturations improved to 95 - 100%....(blow-by: an imprecise method of oxygen delivery in which an oxygen source discharges oxygen in front of the nostrils or mouth of the patient. Used primarily to supply supplemental oxygen to  neonates, who may not tolerate wearing other oxygen delivery systems, Medical Dictionary, © 2009 Farlex and Partners).""  

""Due to the baby's prematurity we elected to intubate the baby...Oxygen saturations rose to 100%...The baby was then placed on the ventilator at the pressure of 20/4 with a rate of 40 on 30% (oxygen).  Oxygen saturations had been 95% to 100%.  (ventilator: a machine designed to move breathable air into and out of the lungs, to provide breathing for a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently,wikipedia.org)."" 

""Blood sugar ...was 50 (normal level when babies are 1 hour to 2 hours old is just under 2 mmol/L millimoles per liter; the presence of high levels of glucose (sugar) in blood occurs due to the lack of sufficient levels of insulin in the body, dovemed.com).""

""...Heart rates in the 150's. Respiratory rates in the 40's to 60's.  We will obtain a CBC (Complete Blood Count) and a blood culture.  Arterial blood gases (ABG's) showed a pH of 7.61 with a PCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) of 20.  PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood) at that time was 51.  Bicarb was 20. We decreased the rate to 30. (ABG's measure the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well the lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood, webmd.com).""

""Chest x-ray showed mild interstitial lung disease, but the Endotracheal Tube placement was good.  (interstitial lung disease is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue between and supporting the air sacs. Associated scarring may cause progressive lung stiffness, eventually affecting the ability to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream, mayoclinic.org).""

""Transport has been arranged with Hospital # 3 and they are en route.  We (Hospital # 2's staff) are going to obtain an IV (intravenous access), start D10W ( Dextrose 10 % In Water Intravenous Solution, webmd.com)...We will also give a Normal Saline bolus... (administration of a discrete amount of medication in order to raise its concentration in the blood to an effective level, wikipedia.org) and then will start Ampicillin and Gentamycin (antibiotics) after blood cultures are drawn...We will repeat ABG's in about thirty minutes. It is now 8 o'clock.  I will discuss this with the patient (Patient Identifier # 1) who is currently recovering from the operation and consent will be obtained for transport.""

IX. Interview with Employee Identifier, EI # 3, Obstetrician at Hospital # 2 on 6/29/17 at 13:25.    

According to EI # 3, the patient (PI # 1) and her grandmother (FI # 1) presented to the ED at Hospital # 1.  A nurse came out to the lobby and told PI # 1 ""there was nothing the hospital could do.""  The patient and her grandmother left the ED and drove to Hospital # 2.  The surveyor asked the physician to explain the risk(s) related to the patient (PI #1) not being evaluated at Hospital # 1's ER.  He replied, ""An unattended preterm delivery in a vehicle.""  EI # 3 said, ""An implication from staff about not offering services or suggesting a patient go to another hospital is inappropriate based on EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) regulations.""  The patient (PI # 1) and her grandmother told the story to me separately. ""I tend to believe them.""

ER Admissions/Patient Transfers
I. Introduction
...Wiregrass Medical Center is committed to full compliance with all state and federal laws regarding transfers of patients from one medical facility to another. Transfers of patients from...and to...may implicate the provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act...the ""anti-dumping law"".

EMTALA generally requires that all hospitals with an emergency department:
Provides all patients who come to the emergency department seeking evaluation or treatment for a medical condition with an appropriate medical screening examination to determine where or not an emergency medical condition exists and, if such condition exists either (a) stabilize the patient or (b) appropriately transfer the patient to another hospital.

An ""emergency medical condition"" is one with symptoms severe enough such that the absence of immediate medical treatment could reaso","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on medical record reviews, interviews, review of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor) Policies and Procedures, emergency room    Policies and Procedures, Wiregrass Medical Center, Hospital # 1, failed to provide a medical screening examination for Patient Identifier (PI) # 1, a patient who presented to the ED (emergency department) with complaints of ""Cramping, Bleeding, Pregnant,"" on 6/12/17.  Furthermore, the ER  RN (emergency room    Registered Nurse) told the patient (PI # 1) no obstetrical services were available at Hospital # 1 before offering a thorough triage assessment to PI # 1.  The RN also advised PI # 1 to go to Enterprise(the name of the city where Hospital # 2) is located.  These comments / ""suggestions"" by the RN contributed to the decision of PI # 1 to leave the ER  at Hospital # 1 without being thoroughly triaged or receiving a medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.   

This deficient practice effected PI #1, one of 32 ED sampled patients and had the potential to negatively impact other patients who present to Hospital #1's Emergency Department with similar obstetrical symptoms. 

Finding include:

I. Hospital # 1's ER  Log dated 6/12/17 documented:

Patient Identifier (PI) # 1's Name. 
Age: 28 years. 
Sex: F. 
Attending Physician: name of EI (Employee Identifier) # 4 / ED Physician.   
Stay Type: ER.
admitted  /time: 6/12/2017  04:39.
Admit Code: Emergency. 
discharge date   /Time: 6/12/2017  04:40.
Mode of arrival: Ambulatory. 
Triage Level: Patient left.
Disposition: AMA (Against Medical Advise).
Discharge Condition: Unknown.  
Chief Complaint: Cramping, Bleeding, Pregnant.    

II. ER  Triage / Physician Order Form: 
No vital signs were documented.  The RN's (Registered Nurse) Employee Identifier (EI # 1's )  name was documented on the form.  
PI # 1's disposition was documented as LWBS (Left Without Being Seen).   
Date: 6/12/17
Time: 04:40 

04:40: ""Patient (PI # 1) left without being seen. She decided to go on to Enterprise(name of town where Hospital # 2 is located) and see her OB-GYN"" (obstetrical and gynecological (physician).  Documented by EI # 1.    

There was no documentation of a Medical Screening Examination in PI # 1's ER  medical record.     

III. Interviews

Interview with EI # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1 on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58:

During an interview on 6/26/17 from 17:33 to 17:58,  Employee Identifier (EI) # 1, RN (Registered Nurse) / ED (Emergency Department) at Hospital # 1, verified she was on duty on 6/12/17 from 18:00-06:00.  EI # 1 confirmed she was responsible for the triage/interview with PI # 1 in the ED lobby. 

EI # 1 reported events of the ED activities related to Patient Identifier (PI # 1) which included registration with an Admission Clerk.  The clerk took PI # 1's chart to the ED nurse's station.  EI # 1, staff ED RN was told by the Admission Clerk a 27 week pregnant lady was in the ED lobby, with complaints of cramping and bleeding (vaginal). When the staff RN opened the ED lobby door, FI # 1, (Family Identifier), the grandmother who accompanied the patient, was screaming this into a cell phone, ""I'm just gonna take her to Enterprise.""  EI # 1 confirmed no other patients were present in the ED lobby.

During the ED lobby encounter with PI # 1, the staff RN (EI # 1) reported asking the patient (PI # 1),  ""How bad are you bleeding?""  PI # 1 response, ""pretty bad.""  

EI # 1 then reported to the surveyors, ""I told PI # 1 like I tell all patients.  We'll be glad to see you, have the doctor assess you and listen to the heart beat of the baby, but Wiregrass (Hospital # 1) does not have OB/GYN services.""  EI # 1 reported asking PI # 1 where her OB physician was located?  PI # 1 reported Enterprise (name of the city where her obstetrician practices). 

EI # 1 reported PI # 1 was crying.  A family member was on the phone screaming, ""I'm just going to take her to Enterprise."" 

EI # 1 reported telling the patient ""to sit still, I'm going to get the other nurse to help.""  EI # 1 reported the patient's response as she ""shook her head (in affirmation).""
EI # 1 reported then exiting the lobby to the nurses' desk where another Staff ED RN, EI # 2 was working. 

EI # 2 reported to EI # 1, ""I guess they were going to leave,"" as EI # 2 observed the patient and another female via a computer monitor in the ED exit the ED lobby.  

EI # 1 (Staff RN, ED, responsible for triage of PI # 1) confirmed EI # 2 did not hear the conversation in the lobby with PI # 1. EI # 2 only observed the patient and family exit the ED lobby to a private vehicle in the parking lot.

EI # 1 reported the process when a patient comes to the ER.  The patient ""registers, then the ward clerk tells the RN the patient presented with chest pain or shortness of breath, one of us (RN's) physically goes out to the lobby gets the patient, brings them to a bed and triage is completed in an exam room...""  

EI # 1 reported she had planned to put PI # 1 in a wheelchair after she retrieved the chair and transfer the patient to an exam room bed where PI # 1 would be triaged and bypass the traditional triage room.

EI # 1 verbalized there was no interaction between the patient and family member and / or the nurse and family member during the initial lobby encounter. The family member, on the phone continued to scream, ""I'm just going to Enterprise.""  EI # 1 reported PI # 1 was tearing and crying like she was hurting. 

EI # 1 reported she did not visualize any blood. EI # 1 denied patient reports of  problems other than cramping and vaginal bleeding which required 1 pad change every hour. 

EI # 1 acknowledged the potential for the patient's water to break (membrane rupture).

EI # 1 reported she documented in the medical record that PI # 1 left without being seen. 

EI # 1 notified EI # 4, ED Physician at Hospital # 1, who was present in the ED when PI # 1 arrived on 6/12/17.  According to the ED Staff RN, EI # 4 responded, ""We would be more than glad to see them."" 

EI # 1 reported she had no knowledge who PI # 1's physician was, only that the physician was in Enterprise.  EI # 1 verbalized if PI # 1 had come to the back (triage), if something was wrong, she would have called the clinic, looked up PI # 1's medical history, got a release signed, faxed the paper work and could have reviewed PI # 1's obstetrical history.   

EI # 1 confirmed the triage and medical screening was not completed for PI # 1. There was no documentation an AMA (against medical advice) was obtained. There was no documentation of a conversation regarding completion of an AMA form with PI # 1 and the family member.

EI # 1 reported a written statement of the events of 6/12/17 of PI # 1's ER  visit was completed on 6/19/17 at the request of the Director Of Nurses, EI # 7.  EI # 1 confirmed the following  events were documented on the written statement:

On June 12, 2017 around 5 AM, this nurse went to check on a patient in the lobby that had registered to be seen. The patient told the ward clerk that she was 27 weeks pregnant, cramping  and bleeding. I (the nurse) went to check on the patient, and bring her back to be seen by our doctor. As I opened the door, her grandmother was on her cell phone screaming "" I'm just going to take her to Enterprise"".  I (the nurse) looked at the patient who was crying, and ""ask her who her OB GYN was?"" The patient stated ""he is in Enterprise.""  This whole time the grandmother was still on her cell phone screaming ""I'm just going to take her to Enterprise,"" the grandmother never once took the cell phone down from her ear. I (the nurse) told the patient we would be glad to have her see our doctor, examine her, and we could listen to the babies heart beat.""  I (the nurse) told the patient ""not to get up, that the nurse was going to get the other RN and a wheelchair."" I (the nurse) went back to the ER, and as I (the nurse) approached the desk, the other RN (named staff) saw them get up and leave on the video camera.

VII. History and Physical for Baby (PI # 33 ) at Hospital # 2: 

admitted  : 6/12/17

Admission and Transfer Summary: 

Chief Complaint: Extreme prematurity at 27 weeks.

History of Present Illness: ""I was called to a C- Section this morning...for a 27 week estimated gestational age delivery.  Mom (PI # 1) had a previous C-Section (cecesarian section) - came in dilated with a bulging bag. Baby was delivered by C-Section breech presentation.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  Rupture of membranes at delivery.   The baby was limp and not breathing, had a heart rate of less than 100, but above 60.  PPV (Positive pressure ventilation: The provision of air under pressure by a mechanical respirator, a machine designed to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere, medicinenet.com) was initiated for three minutes in the C-section room with 100% oxygen.  APGARS (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) were one at one minute, 2 APGARS at 2 minutes and 7 APGARS at 5 minutes (APGAR: a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score reveals how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb, medlineplus.gov).""

""Baby was brought to the nursery...and weighed 870 grams.  The initial oxygen saturation was 85% on room air.  Blow-by was initiated and oxygen saturations improved to 95 - 100%....(blow-by: an imprecise method of oxygen delivery in which an oxygen source discharges oxygen in front of the nostrils or mouth of the patient. Used primarily to supply supplemental oxygen to  neonates, who may not tolerate wearing other oxygen delivery systems, Medical Dictionary, © 2009 Farlex and Partners).""  

""Due to the baby's prematurity we elected to intubate the baby...Oxygen saturations rose to 100%...The baby was then placed on the ventilator at the pressure of 20/4 with a rate of 40 on 30% (oxygen).  Oxygen saturations had been 95% to 100%.  (ventilator: a machine designed to move breathable air into and out of the lungs, to provide breathing for a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently,wikipedia.org)."" 

""Blood sugar ...was 50 (normal level when babies are 1 hour to 2 hours old is just under 2 mmol/L millimoles per liter; the presence of high levels of glucose (sugar) in blood occurs due to the lack of sufficient levels of insulin in the body, dovemed.com).""

""...Heart rates in the 150's. Respiratory rates in the 40's to 60's.  We will obtain a CBC (Complete Blood Count) and a blood culture.  Arterial blood gases (ABG's) showed a pH of 7.61 with a PCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) of 20.  PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood) at that time was 51.  Bicarb was 20. We decreased the rate to 30. (ABG's measure the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well the lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood, webmd.com).""

""Chest x-ray showed mild interstitial lung disease, but the Endotracheal Tube placement was good.  (interstitial lung disease is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue between and supporting the air sacs. Associated scarring may cause progressive lung stiffness, eventually affecting the ability to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream, mayoclinic.org).""

""Transport has been arranged with Hospital # 3 and they are en route.  We (Hospital # 2's staff) are going to obtain an IV (intravenous access), start D10W ( Dextrose 10 % In Water Intravenous Solution, webmd.com)...We will also give a Normal Saline bolus... (administration of a discrete amount of medication in order to raise its concentration in the blood to an effective level, wikipedia.org) and then will start Ampicillin and Gentamycin (antibiotics) after blood cultures are drawn...We will repeat ABG's in about thirty minutes. It is now 8 o'clock.  I will discuss this with the patient (Patient Identifier # 1) who is currently recovering from the operation and consent will be obtained for transport.""

According to EI # 3, the patient (PI # 1) and her grandmother (FI # 1) presented to the ED at Hospital # 1.  A nurse came out to the lobby and told PI # 1 ""there was nothing the hospital could do.""  The patient and her grandmother left the ED and drove to Hospital # 2.  The surveyor asked the physician to explain the risk(s) related to the patient (PI #1) not being evaluated at Hospital # 1's ER.  He replied, ""An unattended preterm delivery in a vehicle.""  EI # 3 said, ""An implication from staff about not offering services or suggesting a patient go to another hospital is inappropriate based on EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) regulations.""

Based on documentation and interviews, the hospital failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department received an appropriate medical screening examination without delay, in one of twenty-two patients reviewed (patient #1). Patient #1's   medical screening examination, which included a pelvic exam and corresponding treatment related to her pregnancy, was not provided to patient #1 for two and one half hours after her arrival at the ED. Findings include:

Patient #1's emergency department (ED) record was reviewed and revealed that patient #1, who was thirteen weeks pregnant with her first child, presented to the ED's triage area on 9/28/12 at 11:28 p.m. with complaints of bilateral, cramping, abdominal pain that radiated to her lower back. Patient #1 reported that she had been having ongoing vaginal spotting for the duration of the pregnancy and that the bleeding increased yesterday. The patient told triage nurse (E) that the vaginal bleeding was bright red today, and the amount of bleeding increased at 10:00 p.m. this evening while she was at home. The patient described her pain level at 5/10 with the pain increasing to 10 plus at intervals. 

The ED record revealed that following her arrival at the ED, patient #1 was told to wait in the waiting room until further treatment could be provided. Patient #1 waited for forty minutes in the waiting room. Within the next one hour and thirty minutes, patient #1 was moved to two different exam rooms, and she continued to wait to be seen by the provider, nurse practitioner (G). Patient #1 did not receive any pain medication for one hour and forty minutes after her arrival at the ED. A pelvic exam and further treatment was not provided to patient #1 for two and one half hours after her arrival at the ED. Following the pelvic exam  patient #1 was taken to the Operating Room at  approximately 4:00 a.m. on 9/29/12, and  physician (F) performed a D & C on patient #1. 

Patient #1 was interviewed by phone on 10/25/12, and she stated she arrived at the ED at approximately 11:00 p.m. on 9/28/12. She was thirteen weeks pregnant with her first child and her water broke at 9:00 p.m. that evening.  She was having severe abdominal pain (she stated the contractions were every ten minutes) and bleeding when she arrived at the ED. She stated she was crying when she was explaining her symptoms to triage nurse (E). Nurse (E) told patient #1 that he had checked with another staff person and was told that there was not an exam room available for patient #1. Nurse (E) told patient #1 to wait in the waiting room. Patient #1 stated it was extremely difficult to sit in the chair in the waiting room because she was having contractions and was shaking and felt like she was going to faint. She went to the bathroom a couple of times while she was in the waiting room and noted that the bleeding continued to be very heavy. She stated she waited for approximately one hour in the waiting room and was moved to a small exam room where she waited for another hour and then was moved to a large exam room. She stated she was screaming while she was in the large exam room. Nurse practitioner (G) entered the room following an additional fifteen minute wait, and patient #1 received two doses of pain medication via an IV. Patient #1 stated nurse practitioner (G) performed a pelvic exam on her about two and one half hours after patient #1 arrived at the ED, and nurse practitioner (G) removed blood clots and the fetus during the exam. Patient #1 stated there was a delay in providing treatment to her when she arrived at the ED. She stated having a miscarriage was a very traumatic experience, and the delay in treating her ""made it even more awful.""  She stated she wondered why she even bothered to go to the ED. 

Nurse (E) was interviewed by phone on 11/1/12, and he stated he was working as the triage nurse on the evening of 9/28/12. The ED was very busy that evening. Patient #1 was bleeding and in a lot of pain when she arrived at the ED that evening. Due to patient #1's symptoms, patient #1 should have been promptly seen following her arrival at the ED, but patient #1 had to wait because there was not an available exam room. Nurse (E) stated patients in the ED that evening probably could have been transferred to other areas/rooms in order to free up an exam room for patient #1 following her arrival at the ED.

Nurse (C) was interviewed in person on 10/30/12 and by phone on 11/1/12. He stated he reviewed the incident, and he determined that considering patient #1's condition on 9/28/12 and 9/29/12, her wait time in the ED was too long, and she should have received care more promptly. He stated he plans to provide education to staff related to the incident and the specific needs of the obstetrical patient in the ED.

Nurse Practitioner (G) was unavailable for an interview during the investigation.

Based on observation, record review, document review, and interview, the facility failed to ensure a medical screening exam was conducted for 2 of 33 patients (Patients #25, #33).

Findings include:

Patient #33

Patient #33 was a [AGE] year old female who presented to the emergency room    (ER) on 4/27/11 at approximately 3:00 AM with complaints of abdominal pain and bleeding. Patient #33 indicated she was 25 weeks pregnant.

There was no medical record created by the facility for Patient #33's ER  encounter. The information was obtained from interviews with the patient's husband and several staff members.

On 5/24/11 at 11:30 AM, Patient #33's husband was interviewed to obtain details of the patient's ER  encounter on 4/27/11. 

Patient #33's husband stated he and his wife (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 3:00 AM. He informed the person at the front desk that his wife was 25 weeks pregnant and was having abdominal pain every 3-5 minutes. She was also having green discharge. The husband indicated he completed a form with his wife's name and gave that to the person at the desk. He waited approximately 10 minutes. His wife was not seen by a nurse or physician.

A staff member then called the Women's Center and indicated his wife would be seen there. Patient #33 and  her husband proceeded to walk to the Women's Center, escorted by a staff member. While they were walking to the Women's Center, Patient #33 started to have a  ""bad""  contraction and slumped over in pain. At that time, the patient's husband asked for a wheelchair for his wife, as he saw a couple of wheelchairs in the hallway. The staff member attempted to take one of the wheelchairs, however, the wheelchairs were chained together and could not be used. Patient #33 proceeded to walk the remainder of the way to the Women's Center. 

Arriving at the Women's Center, the staff member from the ER  informed the staff in the Labor & Delivery (L&D)  area that Patient #33  was there. The ER  staff informed the patient to sit in the L&D waiting area and someone would be with them soon. The ER  staff escort then left Patient #33 and her husband in the L&D waiting area alone.

Patient #33 and her husband sat in the waiting area for around 10 minutes. They observed a couple of staff members entering the unit but no one addressed them. After 10 minutes, the husband started banging on the locked door to the OB unit. An OB staff member informed him that they had 2 C-Sections and they would have to ""wait a bit."" A man opened the door and informed him that they didn't have room for his wife. All beds were full.

After waiting several minutes longer without being seen, Patient #33 and her husband walked back to the ER. At this point he was very mad and started to yell at the staff in the ER. He asked if there were a nurse or doctor available to see his wife. When the husband and the Patient #33 returned to the waiting room, he observed only one person was waiting there.

Patient #33's husband asked where the closest hospital was. The staff member who had escorted them stated - she couldn't believe they had not seen Patient #33 in the L&D area. She then indicated she would contact the house supervisor. At this point, the patient's husband just wanted to leave the hospital and go to a different hospital. The ER  staff then gave him directions to a nearby hospital. 

The couple left the facility and were able to find the nearby facility. Patient #33 was seen immediately, admitted    , and the baby was born within 45 minutes, and required a ventilator.

Patient #33 was not screened by a qualified medical professional in the ER  or in the Labor and Delivery Department.

Interviews with staff members

On 5/25/11 at 7:30 AM, Employee #4, the ER  Triage Nurse, was interviewed. Employee #4 verbalized on the day of the incident at approximately 3:00 AM, the employee was in the ER  Department in the back. She was beeped and informed there was a maternity case.  She came out to the registration desk. Employee #4 asked the patient questions including the patient's due date; how many weeks pregnant - ""25 weeks""; if she was having abdominal pain - ""yes""; the name of her doctor - ""(Dr. Name), Ca.""; indicated this was the first pregnancy; any bleeding - ""No.""

The Triage Nurse added Patient #33 appeared to be in obvious pain.

The Triage Nurse then called Labor and Delivery (L&D) so the patient could be evaluated there. The Triage Nurse indicated the cutoff for patients to be seen in the ER  vs L&D was 20 weeks. If a patient did not know she was pregnant or the gestational age, the patient would be seen in the ER  first to determine the gestational age. If the pregnancy was confirmed and the patient was greater than 20 weeks, the patient would then be sent to L&D.

The Triage Nurse indicated Patient #33's husband had not filled out a registration card in the ER. However, the Triage Nurse added when a patient completed the registration card in the ER, and then was sent to L&D, the registration card was destroyed. The information was not entered into the ER  computer system.

The Triage Nurse called to have a technician (tech) escort Patient #33 to L&D, but the tech was not available. The Triage Nurse asked the patient if she could walk to the L&D area and Patient #33 stated she could. 

At approximately 3:20 AM, the Triage Nurse escorted Patient #33 to the L&D area, which was all the way on the opposite side of the facility. About half way there, the patient bent over in pain. The Triage Nurse asked the patient if she wanted a wheelchair. The employee tried to obtain a wheelchair but the wheelchairs were locked. They proceeded to walk the rest of the way.

Both Patient #33 and her husband appeared to be very nervous. When they arrived at L&D, the Triage Nurse buzzed herself in and the husband and wife entered into the OB (Obstetrical Unit). They were standing in the doorway for a couple of minutes and no one was there. At that time, a staff member was observed pushing a patient, and the female staff member instructed the Triage Nurse to have  Patient #33 and her husband wait in the waiting area. The Triage Nurse brought them out to the waiting area and told them to wait there. The Triage Nurse then left the couple alone in the waiting area and walked back down to the ER.

When the Triage Nurse returned to the ER, she informed the Charge Nurse of the ER  about leaving Patient #33 and her husband alone in the L&D waiting area, and indicated she felt bad about leaving them.

At approximately 3:45 or 3:50 AM, the Triage Nurse was in the triage area and heard a man yelling stating - ""Tell me where a real hospital is, where they can take care of my wife."" She went out to the desk and saw a man but did not recognize him right away. Patient #33 was not visible.

The man continued to yell. There were patients in the lobby. The Triage Nurse followed the man outside and then saw Patient #33. The employee asked ""what happened?"" Patient #33's husband stated - ""There was not a doctor or a nurse who would take care of my wife."" The employee responded, ""You can't say that, that's not true.""

The Charge Nurse then walked out and asked what was going on. Patient #33's husband asked where was another hospital. The Charge Nurse asked Patient #33 to come back inside stating, ""we could help you."" Patient #33's husband was very upset and refused to bring his wife back inside. The Charge Nurse then gave them the name of several hospitals. 

The Triage Nurse was not sure if the security guards had come out to the ER  waiting area during this time. She added the whole incident was about 45 minutes from the time the couple entered the ER  until the time they left.

The employee indicated that no staff member told Patient #33 to leave the hospital. She confirmed Patient #33 was not screened by a nurse or physician prior to leaving the facility. 

On 5/25/11 at 9:00 AM, interviews with the staff working in the L&D area on the night of this incident, the RN Supervisor and the Surgical Technician, confirmed Patient #33 was not screened by a nurse or physician in the L&D area. The staff added there were no beds available due to a high volume of cases. 

The facility policy titled Assessment of Pregnant Patients in OB/Emergency Department dated 12/2010 documented:

- ""A. Patients less than 20-weeks gestation will be initially assessed in the Emergency Department. If an obstetrician is needed, the obstetrician on-call or the patient's own physician will complete the assessment in the Emergency Department.
- ""B. Patients greater than 20-weeks arriving with pregnancy related problems, or symptoms (i.e., cramps, low back pain), will be assessed by the L&D staff in labor and delivery and appropriate obstetrician, as necessary..."" 
 
During the tour of the facility on 5/24/11, the distance between the ER  and the L&D unit was noted to be very long, approximately 800 feet, each unit was at the opposite side of the facility. Also noted in the front of the main lobby behind the volunteer's registration desk, were 2 wheelchairs chained together. One volunteer indicated the wheelchairs were located there so they could be used by the volunteers during the day as needed. The chairs remained locked up at night so they would not be used and would be available for the next day.

On 5/24/11 in the morning, the Chief of Security was interviewed to determine if there was videotape of the incident available. There were two additional security guards, as well as a ""trainee"" present at the time of the interview. None of these security guards were present the night of the incident.  The Chief of Security explained there were cameras located throughout the facility and in the ER  waiting area. The ER  camera captured people at the ER  Registration Desk, as well as the ER  Waiting area.  The videotapes were taped over every 7 days, so no videotape was available for the night of the incident. A security guard added the guards did not sit at the desk monitoring the cameras at all times. They made rounds throughout the facility and responded when they heard a disturbance or were called by staff members.

On 5/24/11 in the morning, the Risk Manager indicated the facility did not pull the tape for the night of this incident, so no videotape was available.

Patient # 25 was a [AGE] year old female who (MDS) dated [DATE] at 16:04 (4:04 PM)  with a chief complaint of abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding, which started 3 hours prior to admission. 

Additional documentation on the Emergency Nursing Record by the triage nurse indicated Patient #25's LMP (Last Menstrual Period) was on December 4, and the patient was pregnant. The patient's current pain level at the time of triage (4:06 PM), was documented as 10/10.

The triage nurse listed the patient's acuity level as a III.

The triage nurse's additional notes indicated ""1615 (4:15 PM) No exam room available. Charge nurse aware. Will protocol. 16:20 (4:20 PM) Unable to start IV (Intravenous) or draw blood. Called lab."" ""1800 (6:00 PM) Patient no longer in lobby.""

The Emergency Department Standing Orders form included in Patient #25's medical record circled the section for vaginal bleeding orders which included:
- ""CBC, (Complete Blood Count), BMP (Basic Metabolic Panel), Serum Preg (Pregnancy), Quant HCG (Quantatative human chorionic gonadotropin), (if pregnant), Cath (Catheterized) UA (urinalysis), RH (Blood type test)
- Collect all vaginal products for examination in a sterile container and label
- Obtain physician order for Pelvic Ultrasound: R/O (Rule out) Ectopic Pregnancy (if pregnant)"" (This order for the Pelvic Ultrasound was crossed out which indicated this was not a valid order for this patient)

An additional notation in this section included ""In lobby"" which indicated the Patient #25 was waiting in the ER  lobby.

There was no documented evidence any blood work was drawn on Patient #25.

 The facility's policy titled Triage - Emergency Department, dated 8/04 documented:
""A. Triage: Defined as the means by which persons seeking emergency medical care are prioritized according to urgency of illness or injury.""

The urgency category indicated :
- ""Category II; Acuity - Urgent; Examples - Open fracture, severe pain, minor burn, acute abdomen, sickle cell crisis. Patients in this category have a potential threat to life or limb or are suffering extreme pain. Generally they will deteriorate if not being treated quickly...""
- ""Category III; Acuity - Nonurgent; Examples - Closed fracture, laceration/contusions, sprains, noncardiac chest pain. Patients in this category must be seen within 1 hour, if possible, because their pain, severe symptoms, or risk profiles indicate the probability of deterioration without intervention...""

On 5/24/11 at 11:00 AM, the R.N. (Registered Nurse) Triage Nurse (Employee #2)  was interviewed. She did not remember Patient #25 but provided general information regarding all patients triaged in the ER. The R.N. indicated when she triaged a patient in the ER, she performed a visual  assessment and then made the determination regarding acuity. Even though a patient indicated the pain level was 10/10, if the R.N.'s visual examine did not confirm that pain level, the patient could wait in the ER  Lobby. The R.N. indicated she checked on the patients waiting in the lobby at least every 2 hours, usually hourly. However, she did not routinely document the hourly checks. The R.N. also revealed when a patient had to wait in the lobby prior to being seen, the patient was instructed to notify the staff if he/she felt there was a change in their condition.

The R.N. explained when there was not a bed available for a patient in the ER, the protocol was to obtain the standing orders and initiate them, such as blood work. Then, when a bed became available, the lab results would be available to the physician, which would prevent any further delays in teatment.

On 2/24/11 at 2122 (9:22 PM), Patient #25 returned to the ER  with the chief complaint of abdominal pain, and was assigned an acuity level III. Documentation by the triage nurse indicated the patient had left AMA (Against Medical Advice) earlier that day. There was no documented evidence in the ER  record from the earlier ER  encounter that the patient left AMA. The documentation on the ER  log indicated the patient left after triage.

Patient #25 was seen by the physician at 2215 (10:15PM). Blood work was drawn and an abdominal ultrasound performed which showed a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Patient #25 was taken to the Operating Room on 2/25/11 at 4:15 AM for an exploratory laparotomy for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Based on observation, record review, document review, and interview, the facility failed to ensure a medical screening exam was conducted for 2 of 33 patients (Patients #25, #33).

Findings include:

Patient #33

Patient #33 was a [AGE] year old female who presented to the emergency room    (ER) on 4/27/11 at approximately 3:00 AM with complaints of abdominal pain and bleeding. Patient #33 indicated she was 25 weeks pregnant.

There was no medical record created by the facility for Patient #33's ER  encounter. The information was obtained from interviews with the patient's husband and several staff members.

On 5/24/11 at 11:30 AM, Patient #33's husband was interviewed to obtain details of the patient's ER  encounter on 4/27/11. 

Patient #33's husband stated he and his wife (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 3:00 AM. He informed the person at the front desk that his wife was 25 weeks pregnant and was having abdominal pain every 3-5 minutes. She was also having green discharge. The husband indicated he completed a form with his wife's name and gave that to the person at the desk. He waited approximately 10 minutes. His wife was not seen by a nurse or physician.

A staff member then called the Women's Center and indicated his wife would be seen there. Patient #33 and  her husband proceeded to walk to the Women's Center, escorted by a staff member. While they were walking to the Women's Center, Patient #33 started to have a  ""bad""  contraction and slumped over in pain. At that time, the patient's husband asked for a wheelchair for his wife, as he saw a couple of wheelchairs in the hallway. The staff member attempted to take one of the wheelchairs, however, the wheelchairs were chained together and could not be used. Patient #33 proceeded to walk the remainder of the way to the Women's Center. 

Arriving at the Women's Center, the staff member from the ER  informed the staff in the Labor & Delivery (L&D)  area that Patient #33  was there. The ER  staff informed the patient to sit in the L&D waiting area and someone would be with them soon. The ER  staff escort then left Patient #33 and her husband in the L&D waiting area alone.

Patient #33 and her husband sat in the waiting area for around 10 minutes. They observed a couple of staff members entering the unit but no one addressed them. After 10 minutes, the husband started banging on the locked door to the OB unit. An OB staff member informed him that they had 2 C-Sections and they would have to ""wait a bit."" A man opened the door and informed him that they didn't have room for his wife. All beds were full.

After waiting several minutes longer without being seen, Patient #33 and her husband walked back to the ER. At this point he was very mad and started to yell at the staff in the ER. He asked if there were a nurse or doctor available to see his wife. When the husband and the Patient #33 returned to the waiting room, he observed only one person was waiting there.

Patient #33's husband asked where the closest hospital was. The staff member who had escorted them stated - she couldn't believe they had not seen Patient #33 in the L&D area. She then indicated she would contact the house supervisor. At this point, the patient's husband just wanted to leave the hospital and go to a different hospital. The ER  staff then gave him directions to a nearby hospital. 

The couple left the facility and were able to find the nearby facility. Patient #33 was seen immediately, admitted    , and the baby was born within 45 minutes, and required a ventilator.

Patient #33 was not screened by a qualified medical professional in the ER  or in the Labor and Delivery Department.

Interviews with staff members

On 5/25/11 at 7:30 AM, Employee #4, the ER  Triage Nurse, was interviewed. Employee #4 verbalized on the day of the incident at approximately 3:00 AM, the employee was in the ER  Department in the back. She was beeped and informed there was a maternity case.  She came out to the registration desk. Employee #4 asked the patient questions including the patient's due date; how many weeks pregnant - ""25 weeks""; if she was having abdominal pain - ""yes""; the name of her doctor - ""(Dr. Name), Ca.""; indicated this was the first pregnancy; any bleeding - ""No.""

The Triage Nurse added Patient #33 appeared to be in obvious pain.

The Triage Nurse then called Labor and Delivery (L&D) so the patient could be evaluated there. The Triage Nurse indicated the cutoff for patients to be seen in the ER  vs L&D was 20 weeks. If a patient did not know she was pregnant or the gestational age, the patient would be seen in the ER  first to determine the gestational age. If the pregnancy was confirmed and the patient was greater than 20 weeks, the patient would then be sent to L&D.

The Triage Nurse indicated Patient #33's husband had not filled out a registration card in the ER. However, the Triage Nurse added when a patient completed the registration card in the ER, and then was sent to L&D, the registration card was destroyed. The information was not entered into the ER  computer system.

The Triage Nurse called to have a technician (tech) escort Patient #33 to L&D, but the tech was not available. The Triage Nurse asked the patient if she could walk to the L&D area and Patient #33 stated she could. 

At approximately 3:20 AM, the Triage Nurse escorted Patient #33 to the L&D area, which was all the way on the opposite side of the facility. About half way there, the patient bent over in pain. The Triage Nurse asked the patient if she wanted a wheelchair. The employee tried to obtain a wheelchair but the wheelchairs were locked. They proceeded to walk the rest of the way.

Both Patient #33 and her husband appeared to be very nervous. When they arrived at L&D, the Triage Nurse buzzed herself in and the husband and wife entered into the OB (Obstetrical Unit). They were standing in the doorway for a couple of minutes and no one was there. At that time, a staff member was observed pushing a patient, and the female staff member instructed the Triage Nurse to have  Patient #33 and her husband wait in the waiting area. The Triage Nurse brought them out to the waiting area and told them to wait there. The Triage Nurse then left the couple alone in the waiting area and walked back down to the ER.

When the Triage Nurse returned to the ER, she informed the Charge Nurse of the ER  about leaving Patient #33 and her husband alone in the L&D waiting area, and indicated she felt bad about leaving them.

At approximately 3:45 or 3:50 AM, the Triage Nurse was in the triage area and heard a man yelling stating - ""Tell me where a real hospital is, where they can take care of my wife."" She went out to the desk and saw a man but did not recognize him right away. Patient #33 was not visible.

The man continued to yell. There were patients in the lobby. The Triage Nurse followed the man outside and then saw Patient #33. The employee asked ""what happened?"" Patient #33's husband stated - ""There was not a doctor or a nurse who would take care of my wife."" The employee responded, ""You can't say that, that's not true.""

The Charge Nurse then walked out and asked what was going on. Patient #33's husband asked where was another hospital. The Charge Nurse asked Patient #33 to come back inside stating, ""we could help you."" Patient #33's husband was very upset and refused to bring his wife back inside. The Charge Nurse then gave them the name of several hospitals. 

The Triage Nurse was not sure if the security guards had come out to the ER  waiting area during this time. She added the whole incident was about 45 minutes from the time the couple entered the ER  until the time they left.

The employee indicated that no staff member told Patient #33 to leave the hospital. She confirmed Patient #33 was not screened by a nurse or physician prior to leaving the facility. 

On 5/25/11 at 9:00 AM, interviews with the staff working in the L&D area on the night of this incident, the RN Supervisor and the Surgical Technician, confirmed Patient #33 was not screened by a nurse or physician in the L&D area. The staff added there were no beds available due to a high volume of cases. 

The facility policy titled Assessment of Pregnant Patients in OB/Emergency Department dated 12/2010 documented:

- ""A. Patients less than 20-weeks gestation will be initially assessed in the Emergency Department. If an obstetrician is needed, the obstetrician on-call or the patient's own physician will complete the assessment in the Emergency Department.
- ""B. Patients greater than 20-weeks arriving with pregnancy related problems, or symptoms (i.e., cramps, low back pain), will be assessed by the L&D staff in labor and delivery and appropriate obstetrician, as necessary..."" 
 
During the tour of the facility on 5/24/11, the distance between the ER  and the L&D unit was noted to be very long, approximately 800 feet, each unit was at the opposite side of the facility. Also noted in the front of the main lobby behind the volunteer's registration desk, were 2 wheelchairs chained together. One volunteer indicated the wheelchairs were located there so they could be used by the volunteers during the day as needed. The chairs remained locked up at night so they would not be used and would be available for the next day.

On 5/24/11 in the morning, the Chief of Security was interviewed to determine if there was videotape of the incident available. There were two additional security guards, as well as a ""trainee"" present at the time of the interview. None of these security guards were present the night of the incident.  The Chief of Security explained there were cameras located throughout the facility and in the ER  waiting area. The ER  camera captured people at the ER  Registration Desk, as well as the ER  Waiting area.  The videotapes were taped over every 7 days, so no videotape was available for the night of the incident. A security guard added the guards did not sit at the desk monitoring the cameras at all times. They made rounds throughout the facility and responded when they heard a disturbance or were called by staff members.

On 5/24/11 in the morning, the Risk Manager indicated the facility did not pull the tape for the night of this incident, so no videotape was available.

Based on observation, interview and record review, in accordance with hospital policies and/or medical staff bylaws, the emergency department (ED) at [Hospital] had the capability and capacity of providing medical screening examination (MSE) and continuous monitoring for two of 26 patients, a woman in labor (Patient 1) and a newborn infant (Patient 2), when:  

1. After the emergency department nurse practitioner (EDNP 2) determined that Patient 2 required emergency medical care, the emergency department physician, (EDMD 1) did not provide a complete MSE and provide continuous monitoring that was needed to direct and provide the appropriate stabilizing medical treatment.
2. The ED did not have the required equipment to provide an MSE and continuous monitoring of Patient 2.
3. The ED staff were not prepared to provide the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (emergency procedure that can help with breathing, circulation, and survival of patients) on Patient 2.
4. EDMD1 did not complete a MSE on Patient 1's arrival to the ED
5. Patient 1 had a MSE about one and half hours after arrival and minutes before her 
transfer. 
6. The ED staff were not prepared for resuscitation of a patient in the third stage of labor, and delivery of the placenta.

The failure to provide a timely MSE contributed to a delay in care and stabilization of Patient 1 which contributed to the negative impact on Patient 1's health. The failure of the [Hospital] to provide an MSE and continuous monitoring affected and delayed Patient 2's medical care and healthcare outcomes. 

Findings:

The chart of newborn premature infant, Patient 2, indicated the following timeline of events on 08/23/2020: 

At 1:55 p.m., the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Arrest sheet indicated Patient 2 arrived at ambulance bay entrance (ED doors where ambulances arrive and depart) and was assigned ESI 1 (Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a tool for use in emergency department to rank patients into five groups, from level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent)). 

The documentation by EDNP 2 indicated Patient 2 was between mom's legs, not breathing, cyanotic, (blue color due to lack of oxygen), pulseless and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was started. Patient 2, still connected to the mother, (Patient 1) via the umbilical cord (a cord with veins and artery connecting baby to the mother's placenta which allows the baby to receive blood oxygen and nutrients) was brought into the ED for further evaluation.  

At 2:00 p.m., the CPR Arrest sheet indicated CPR was in progress for Patient 2. The CPR Arrest sheet indicated that ""all medications [for Patient 2 were] based off of Broselow tape.

The Team stated that the ED has a pediatric resuscitation cart (a cart ready to use containing emergency equipment for delivering oxygen, suctioning, starting IV, intubating and monitoring). The Team produced a Broselow tape stored in the cart and indicated the drawers were color-coded and reflected the color coding on the Broselow Tape. The Team stated, the ED used the Broselow tape to determine the dose of medication and equipment needed during infant and pediatric CPR. The Team stated the ""grey"" color was used for newborn patients weighing 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 8.8 pounds). The Team stated the ED did not have a guide for patient's that were 0.45 kg (one pound) and 30.5 cm (12 inches). The Team were unable to find resuscitation equipment necessary to support a newborn or premature infant in distress on the pediatric resuscitation cart. The Team explained there was no resuscitation equipment for infants below 3 to 5 Kg in the cart and indicated the equipment was on the ""Panda warmer [a warming bed for newborn infants]"". The Team located the Panda warmer about 1 minute away from the pediatric resuscitation cart in an ED hallway.The Team searched the Panda warmer drawers for newborn and premature infant equipment for over 25 minutes, but was unable to locate resuscitation equipment like different sizes to intubation tubes and blades (items needed to place a breathing tube to support respirations and provide oxygen delivery), different sizes of oxygen masks and suction catheters, IV access tools, and monitoring tools. The drawers were observed to be unlabeled and unorganized. The Team stated the equipment was not available. The Team stated if resuscitation equipment was not available during CPR, they would call central supply. The Team stated they did not know how long it would take to obtain the needed equipment. The Team acknowledged they did not know the medications or process for neonatal (newborn) resuscitation and CPR. The Team indicated they had not participated in educational program or training for newborn term or premature infants. The Team indicated ""these are planned"". 

The DoC was asked for policy and procedures for emergency procedures, ACLS and PALS, and neonatal resuscitation. DoC stated the Hospital did not have any.

During a concurrent interview and record review, on 4/21/2022 at 4:02 p.m. with EDNP 2, EDNP 2 stated, ""I was the only one at the car"" when Patient 2 arrived. EDNP 2 stated, Patient 1 was ""delivering the baby or delivered baby"". EDNP stated Patient 2 was still attached to mom via the umbilical cord, was ""cyanotic"" and ""not breathing"". EDNP 2 stated she started CPR. EDNP 2 stated there was no ""oxygen at the car"". EDNP stated that she was the ""most capable"" to care for Patient 2 because her eight years of experience as a NICU nurse. EDNP 2 stated MD 1 ""was not at the car"". EDNP 2 stated in the ED, EDMD 1 was at the head of Patient 2's bed and in charge of Patient 2's care. EDNP 2 acknowledged it took 26 minutes to intubate Patient 2 because intubation equipment was not available. EDNP acknowledged it took 35 minutes to obtain IV access for Patient 2. EDNP stated that she could not recall what steps were taken to acquire the necessary items intubate and gain IV access. EDNP stated she could not recall what care was provided to Patient 2 while waiting for resuscitation equipment. EDNP 2 stated that if the necessary equipment was not available and help was needed to care for Patient 2, she would have called anesthesia team to help intubate and obtain IV access. EDNP 2 indicated anesthesia was not called to help. EDNP 2 acknowledged she charted after Patient 2's death. EDNP 2 stated, that her ""world disappeared"" and she ""could not see the monitors"". EDNP 2 acknowledged that Patient 2's record did not indicate documented ongoing CPR or continuous monitoring of HR, heart rhythm, RR, pulses present or absent, oxygen delivery, oxygen saturation, EtC02, temperature or fluid administered. EDNP 2 acknowledged she documented that Patient 2 was in ""serve respiratory distress ...Respiratory effort labored ...severe distress"". EDNP 2 acknowledged she charted that Patient 2's temperature ""improved 30.5 to 35.7 and skin color improved"". EDNP acknowledged that EDMD 1 charted, Patient 2 ""did become pink and remained pink"" after intubation. EDNP 2 stated that this indicated Patient 2 had "" better perfusion (blood flow and oxygen to the body)"". EDNP 2 stated, she could not recall why medication were given, the doses of medications given or the response to the medications. EDNP 2 stated, EDMD 1 ordered the medications and acknowledged ""all medications were based off Broselow"". EDNP 2 reviewed the Broselow tape and acknowledged the grey area was for infants above 3kg (6.6 pounds). NP stated the use of the Broselow tape for medications was based on weight and not appropriated for Patient 2 who weighed 0.45 Kg (one pound). EDNP 2 acknowledged the medication doses given to Patient 2 were greater than three times the recommended doses. EDNP 2 stated that ""too much atropine can be toxic"". 

During an interview on 4/21/2022 at 12:14 p.m., with the on-call anesthesiologists (physicians trained in resuscitation, CPR, intubation and IV access) who were at [Hospital] during Patient 1 and 2's stay, the on-call anesthesiologists (OCA) 1 and 2 stated that the anesthesia team was available to help care for Patient 1 and Patient 2 in the ED; but neither were called. OCA 1 stated that the anesthesia team is called about once a month to help in the ED with intubations and IV access.

During a concurrent interview and record review, on 4/21/2022 at 4:02 p.m. with Emergency Department Nursing Supervisor, (EDNS), EDNS stated that she was not present for the resuscitation of Patient 2. EDNS stated when a patient arrives at the ED, the staff start care. EDNS acknowledged the chart indicated Patient 2 was an ESI 1. EDNS stated, an ESI 1 signals the need for ""immediate attention"" and ""most critical"" patients. EDNS, stated the ""typical process"", for patient classified as ESI 1, is to place the patient on a ""cardiac monitor"" and obtain vitals (BP, HR, RR, pulse, O2 Sat, temperature), and obtain IV access, EKG and labs. EDNS stated the goal is to ""keep the patient alive"". EDNS acknowledged during review of Patient 2's chart, the [Hospital] was unable to locate nursing documentation of continuous monitoring, vitals sign or laboratory values. EDNS stated that she could not locate documentation of Patient 2's response to treatment or medications.
 
During review of Patient 2's records, EDNS acknowledged the record indicated ""respiratory effort labored"", ""heart rate"", and after intubation became ""pink"". EDNS stated, an infant with a heart rate and breathing is ""living"". EDNS indicated after intubation and Patient 2 turning ""pink"" indicated ""circulation (delivery of blood and oxygen in the body)"". EDNS stated, that if the necessary tools for resuscitation, CPR and emergency stabilization are not available, the nurses would obtain the ""equipment from central supply"". EDNS was unable to state how much time this would take. 

During a phone interview on 4/21/2022 at 1:05 p.m. with EDNP 1, EDNP 1 stated that he did not have Patient 2's record in front of him, but could ""recall exactly"" the events that occurred on 8/23/2022 in the ""main ED"".

EDMD 1 stated that he had ""not been exposed"" to the Panda warmer. EDMD 1 stated it took ""90 seconds"" to get resuscitation equipment and, after arrival, to obtain equipment took another ""90 seconds"" to intubate Patient 2. EDMD 1 stated Patient 1 ""pinked-up after intubation ...and CPR was effective"". EDMD 1 stated that he intubated Patient 2 ""within 90 seconds"" after equipment was available. EDMD 1 stated the Broselow tape was a ""mechanical mechanism to measure and weigh a child..and gives the doses for all medications"". EDMD 1 stated that EDNP 1 called the NICU and IMD. EDMD 1 stated that he had EMTALA training ""two months ago"". EDMD 1 stated EMTALA ""has to do with transferring patients and prevent dumping of patients"". EDMD 1 stated that he was board ceritified in emergency medicine and it was not required to have certifications on pediatric and neonatal CPR and resuscitation.

LDMD stated an infant born at ""26 weeks is viable [can survive]"". LDMD stated a premature infant with a heart rate and respiratory rate would be ""considered still alive and would resuscitate [perform CPR]"". LDMD stated that an infant that turns pink after intubation indicates ""good oxygenation ...perfusion [blood flow and oxygen to the body] is good"". LDMD stated the Broselow ""grey colored zone"" was ""not for a 26 week"" premature infant.

The policy indicated [Hospital] ""will comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ... Capability: The physical space, equipment, staff, supplies and services (e.g., surgery, intensive care, pediatrics, obstetrics and psychiatry) ... To stabilize: With respect to emergency condition, to either provide such medical treatment of the condition ...Stable for Transfer... the treating physician has determined, with reasonable clinical confidence that an individual i.e., expected to leave the Hospital and be received at the second Hospital, with no material deterioration of his/her medical condition..."" 

Review of the [Hospital] policy titled, ""Acceptance/interhospital Transfer Procedure"", effective 5/5/2016, approved 5/5/2016, next review 5/17/2017. indicated the ""physician's responsibilities ...""provide an examination and necessary stabilizing treatment"". Review of national guidelines, according to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the nation's leading group of physicians that provides guidelines and the standard of care, indicate ""stillborn infant has been defined as a child of at least 20 weeks gestation or at least 400 gm weight at delivery which has not breathed after delivery. The criterion of life is the presence of a heartbeat after complete expulsion or extraction of the child from its mother. The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics defines fetal death as the delivery of a fetus showing no signs of life as indicated by the absence of breathing, heartbeats, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movements of voluntary muscles."" https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/obstetric-care consensus/articles/2020/03/management-of-stillbirth. Accessed 04/20/2022.

Review of national guidelines, according to Part 5: Neonatal Resuscitation 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary (CPR). The guidelines indicated the Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care for Newborn resuscitation: 1. Most newly born infants do not require immediate cord clamping or resuscitation. 2. Inflation and ventilation of the lungs are the priority in newly born infants who need support after birth. 3. Heart rate is assessed initially by auscultation and/or palpation. 4 Assessment of Heart Rate. 5. Electrocardiography is an important adjuncts in babies requiring resuscitation. 6. Pulse oximetry is used to guide oxygen therapy and meet oxygen saturation goals. 7. PPV remains the primary method for providing support for newborns who are apneic, bradycardic, or demonstrate inadequate respiratory effort. Most babies will respond to this intervention. PPV may be initiated with air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies, and up to 30% oxygen in preterm babies. 8. Chest compressions are provided if there is a poor heart rate response to ventilation after appropriate ventilation corrective steps, which preferably include endotracheal intubation. 9. The heart rate response to chest compressions and medications should be monitored electrocardiographically. 10. If the response to chest compressions is poor, it may be reasonable to provide epinephrine, preferably via the intravenous route. 11. Failure to respond to epinephrine in a newborn with history or examination consistent with blood loss may require volume expansion. 12. When vascular access is required in the newly born, the umbilical venous route is preferred. When intravenous access is not feasible, the intraosseous route may be considered. 13. Medications, if the heart rate remains less than 60/min despite 60 seconds of chest compressions and adequate PPV, epinephrine should be administered, ideally via the intravenous route. Atropine is not indicated in the guidelines. 14. If all these steps of resuscitation are effectively completed and there is no heart rate response by 20 minutes, redirection of care should be discussed with the team and family.

The chart of Patient 1 indicated the following timeline of events before and after the interhospital transfer on 08/23/2020: 

At 1:55 p.m., the patient record indicated Patient 1 arrived at [Hospital] ambulance bay (ED entrance for ambulances).The documentation by emergency department nurse practitioner (EDNP) 2, indicated Patient 1 delivered an infant. The chart indicated Patient 2 who was still attached to Patient 1 via the umbilical cord. The chart indicated Patient 1 and 2 were brought into the emergency department (ED) and placed in the same room. EDNP 2's documentation occurred after Patient 1's departure from [Hospital]. The documentation by emergency department registered nurse (EDRN) 1 indicated Patient 1 was ""in distress due to pain, patient in labor ...patient presented to ED by private car in active labor with neonate delivered ...rate 100 ' s, heart rhythm, sinus tachycardia ...placenta not delivered on time of arrival."" EDRN 1's documentation occurred after Patient 1's departure from [Hospital].

At 2:00 p.m., the patient record indicated Patient 1 was placed on non-invasive blood pressure monitor and continuous pulse oximetry. The chart did not indicate Patient 1 had an evaluation by an EDNP or phy","




 

Based on observation, interview and record review, in accordance with hospital policies and/or medical staff bylaws, the emergency department (ED) at [Hospital] had the capability and capacity of providing medical screening examination (MSE) and continuous monitoring for two of 26 patients, a woman in labor (Patient 1) and a newborn infant (Patient 2), when:  

1. After the emergency department nurse practitioner (EDNP 2) determined that Patient 2 required emergency medical care, the emergency department physician, (EDMD 1) did not provide a complete MSE and provide continuous monitoring that was needed to direct and provide the appropriate stabilizing medical treatment.
2. The ED did not have the required equipment to provide an MSE and continuous monitoring of Patient 2.
3. The ED staff were not prepared to provide the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (emergency procedure that can help with breathing, circulation, and survival of patients) on Patient 2.
4. EDMD1 did not complete a MSE on Patient 1's arrival to the ED
5. Patient 1 had a MSE about one and half hours after arrival and minutes before her 
transfer. 
6. The ED staff were not prepared for resuscitation of a patient in the third stage of labor, and delivery of the placenta.

The failure to provide a timely MSE contributed to a delay in care and stabilization of Patient 1 which contributed to the negative impact on Patient 1's health. The failure of the [Hospital] to provide an MSE and continuous monitoring affected and delayed Patient 2's medical care and healthcare outcomes. 

Findings:

The chart of newborn premature infant, Patient 2, indicated the following timeline of events on 08/23/2020: 

At 1:55 p.m., the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Arrest sheet indicated Patient 2 arrived at ambulance bay entrance (ED doors where ambulances arrive and depart) and was assigned ESI 1 (Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a tool for use in emergency department to rank patients into five groups, from level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent)). 

The documentation by EDNP 2 indicated Patient 2 was between mom's legs, not breathing, cyanotic, (blue color due to lack of oxygen), pulseless and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was started.

The chart indicated, EDUC informed emergency room    nurse practitioner (EDNP) 1, an ambulance was coming to pick-up Patient 2 for transfer to [Hospital].

At 3:29 p.m., the CPR Arrest sheet indicated narrow QRS asystole for one minute, pause narrow complex, and sinus bradycardia and heart rate of 46. CPR Arrest sheet did not indicate continuous monitoring of RR, pulses present or absent, oxygen delivery, oxygen saturation, end title carbon dioxide (EtC02), temperature or fluid administered.

At 3:34 p.m., the CPR Arrest sheet indicated Patient 2 was in asystole (no heart rhythm). The documentation by EDMD 1 indicated Patient 2 had a bradycardia (low heart rate) in the 10's to 20's, and CPR was continued for another 10 minutes. EDMD 1's documentation occurred at 6:25 p.m., after Patient 2's death.

At 3:45 p.m., the patient record indicated the death of Patient 2 was pronounced by EDMD 1.

At 6:14 p.m., the chart indicated EDNP 2 called NICU physician at transferring [Facility], NMD and updated NMD about Patient 2's status. 

During a concurrent interview, observation, and document review in the ED on 4/20/2022 at 1:19 p.m. with [Hospital] leadership team (Team) which included the Patient Care Executive (PCE), Emergency Department Nurse Director (EDND), Director of Quality (DoC), Emergency Department Nurse Supervisor (EDNS). The Team stated that the ED has a pediatric resuscitation cart (a cart ready to use containing emergency equipment for delivering oxygen, suctioning, starting IV, intubating and monitoring). The Team produced a Broselow tape stored in the cart and indicated the drawers were color-coded and reflected the color coding on the Broselow Tape. The Team stated, the ED used the Broselow tape to determine the dose of medication and equipment needed during infant and pediatric CPR. The Team stated the ""grey"" color was used for newborn patients weighing 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 8.8 pounds). The Team stated the ED did not have a guide for patient's that were 0.45 kg (one pound) and 30.5 cm (12 inches). The Team were unable to find resuscitation equipment necessary to support a newborn or premature infant in distress on the pediatric resuscitation cart. The Team explained there was no resuscitation equipment for infants below 3 to 5 Kg in the cart and indicated the equipment was on the ""Panda warmer [a warming bed for newborn infants]"". The Team located the Panda warmer about 1 minute away from the pediatric resuscitation cart in an ED hallway.The Team searched the Panda warmer drawers for newborn and premature infant equipment for over 25 minutes, but was unable to locate resuscitation equipment like different sizes to intubation tubes and blades (items needed to place a breathing tube to support respirations and provide oxygen delivery), different sizes of oxygen masks and suction catheters, IV access tools, and monitoring tools. The drawers were observed to be unlabeled and unorganized. The Team stated the equipment was not available. The Team stated if resuscitation equipment was not available during CPR, they would call central supply. The Team stated they did not know how long it would take to obtain the needed equipment. The Team acknowledged they did not know the medications or process for neonatal (newborn) resuscitation and CPR. The Team indicated they had not participated in educational program or training for newborn term or premature infants. The Team indicated ""these are planned"". 

The DoC was asked for policy and procedures for emergency procedures, ACLS and PALS, and neonatal resuscitation. DoC stated the Hospital did not have any.

During a concurrent interview and record review, on 4/21/2022 at 4:02 p.m. with EDNP 2, EDNP 2 stated, ""I was the only one at the car"" when Patient 2 arrived. EDNP 2 stated, Patient 1 was ""delivering the baby or delivered baby"". EDNP stated Patient 2 was still attached to mom via the umbilical cord, was ""cyanotic"" and ""not breathing"". EDNP 2 stated she started CPR. EDNP 2 stated there was no ""oxygen at the car"". EDNP stated that she was the ""most capable"" to care for Patient 2 because her eight years of experience as a NICU nurse. EDNP 2 stated MD 1 ""was not at the car"". EDNP 2 stated in the ED, EDMD 1 was at the head of Patient 2's bed and in charge of Patient 2's care. EDNP 2 acknowledged it took 26 minutes to intubate Patient 2 because intubation equipment was not available. EDNP acknowledged it took 35 minutes to obtain IV access for Patient 2. EDNP stated that she could not recall what steps were taken to acquire the necessary items intubate and gain IV access. EDNP stated she could not recall what care was provided to Patient 2 while waiting for resuscitation equipment. EDNP 2 stated that if the necessary equipment was not available and help was needed to care for Patient 2, she would have called anesthesia team to help intubate and obtain IV access. EDNP 2 indicated anesthesia was not called to help. EDNP 2 acknowledged she charted after Patient 2's death. EDNP 2 stated, that her ""world disappeared"" and she ""could not see the monitors"". EDNP 2 acknowledged that Patient 2's record did not indicate documented ongoing CPR or continuous monitoring of HR, heart rhythm, RR, pulses present or absent, oxygen delivery, oxygen saturation, EtC02, temperature or fluid administered. EDNP 2 acknowledged she documented that Patient 2 was in ""serve respiratory distress ...Respiratory effort labored ...severe distress"". EDNP 2 acknowledged she charted that Patient 2's temperature ""improved 30.5 to 35.7 and skin color improved"". EDNP acknowledged that EDMD 1 charted, Patient 2 ""did become pink and remained pink"" after intubation. EDNP 2 stated that this indicated Patient 2 had "" better perfusion (blood flow and oxygen to the body)"". EDNP 2 stated, she could not recall why medication were given, the doses of medications given or the response to the medications. EDNP 2 stated, EDMD 1 ordered the medications and acknowledged ""all medications were based off Broselow"". EDNP 2 reviewed the Broselow tape and acknowledged the grey area was for infants above 3kg (6.6 pounds). NP stated the use of the Broselow tape for medications was based on weight and not appropriated for Patient 2 who weighed 0.45 Kg (one pound). EDNP 2 acknowledged the medication doses given to Patient 2 were greater than three times the recommended doses. EDNP 2 stated that ""too much atropine can be toxic"". 

During an interview on 4/21/2022 at 12:14 p.m., with the on-call anesthesiologists (physicians trained in resuscitation, CPR, intubation and IV access) who were at [Hospital] during Patient 1 and 2's stay, the on-call anesthesiologists (OCA) 1 and 2 stated that the anesthesia team was available to help care for Patient 1 and Patient 2 in the ED; but neither were called. OCA 1 stated that the anesthesia team is called about once a month to help in the ED with intubations and IV access. 

During a concurrent interview and record review, on 4/21/2022 at 11:38 a.m. with EDRN 1, EDRN 1 stated he went to the car located at the ambulance bay, and helped EDNP 1 with the care of Patient 1 and 2. EDRN 1 stated that EDMD 1 was not at the car. EDRN 1 stated Patient 2 was covered in blood and attached to Patient 1 via the umbilical cord.

EDRN 1 stated, EDMD 1 was in the emergency room    and ""in-charge"" of Patients 1 and 2. EDRN 1 stated, Patient 2 was surrounded by ED staff and he could not see Patient 2 or the monitors. EDRN 1 stated that as directed by EDMD 1, he gave medications to Patient 2. EDRN 1 indicated EDMD 1 used the Broselow grey colored-coded area for a 3 to 5 Kg (6.6 to 8.8 pounds) baby for medication doses. EDRN 1 stated that he was unaware of Patient 2's weight. EDRN 1 stated repeated doses of atropine and epinephrine were given to Patient 2. EDRN 1 stated with each dose of atropine Patient 2's heart rate got slower. EDRN 1 acknowledged he did not record Patient 2's HR, RR, temperature, heart rhythm, oxygen delivery, O2 saturation, EtCO2, pulse, reason for medications or response to medications. EDRN 1 acknowledged that he did not know the appropriate medication doses, resuscitation or CPR requirements for a premature or newborn infant. EDRN 1 stated the ED did not have a guide for patient's that weighed 0.45 kg (1 pound). EDRN 1 stated the hospital has not provided an educational program or training for neonatal codes. 

During a concurrent interview and record review, on 4/21/2022 at 4:02 p.m. with Emergency Department Nursing Supervisor, (EDNS), EDNS stated that she was not present for the resuscitation of Patient 2. EDNS stated when a patient arrives at the ED, the staff start care. EDNS acknowledged the chart indicated Patient 2 was an ESI 1. EDNS stated, an ESI 1 signals the need for ""immediate attention"" and ""most critical"" patients. EDNS, stated the ""typical process"", for patient classified as ESI 1, is to place the patient on a ""cardiac monitor"" and obtain vitals (BP, HR, RR, pulse, O2 Sat, temperature), and obtain IV access, EKG and labs. EDNS stated the goal is to ""keep the patient alive"". EDNS acknowledged during review of Patient 2's chart, the [Hospital] was unable to locate nursing documentation of continuous monitoring, vitals sign or laboratory values. EDNS stated that she could not locate documentation of Patient 2's response to treatment or medications.
 
During review of Patient 2's records, EDNS acknowledged the record indicated ""respiratory effort labored"", ""heart rate"", and after intubation became ""pink"". EDNS stated, an infant with a heart rate and breathing is ""living"". EDNS indicated after intubation and Patient 2 turning ""pink"" indicated ""circulation (delivery of blood and oxygen in the body)"". EDNS stated, that if the necessary tools for resuscitation, CPR and emergency stabilization are not available, the nurses would obtain the ""equipment from central supply"". EDNS was unable to state how much time this would take. 

During a phone interview on 4/21/2022 at 1:05 p.m. with EDNP 1, EDNP 1 stated that he did not have Patient 2's record in front of him, but could ""recall exactly"" the events that occurred on 8/23/2022 in the ""main ED"". EDNP 1 stated the events were ""crazy ...everyone ...chaos"". EDNP 1 stated that he did not provide care for Patient 2.

EDNP 1 stated, that he was acting as the ""scribe"" for EDMD 1 whom he had received information from. EDNP 1 stated that if there was a change in Patient 2's status, EDMD 1 should have notified NMD. EDNP 1 stated that under EMTALA, ED patients ""immediately"" receive a medical screening exam and are ""stabilized"". EDNP 1 stated that if a patient is transferred, the provider needs to speak with the receiving facility to accept transfer and provide documentation. EDNP 1 indicated that if the equipment required for CPR or resuscitation was not available, he would ask the charge nurse for help. EDNP 1 indicated he was not familiar with the Broselow tape, or the location of the emergency resuscitation carts and Panda warmer. EDNP 1 stated he had not participated in a [Hospital] educational program or training for CPR or neonatal resuscitation.

EDMD 1 stated that he had ""not been exposed"" to the Panda warmer. EDMD 1 stated it took ""90 seconds"" to get resuscitation equipment and, after arrival, to obtain equipment took another ""90 seconds"" to intubate Patient 2. EDMD 1 stated Patient 1 ""pinked-up after intubation ...and CPR was effective"". EDMD 1 stated that he intubated Patient 2 ""within 90 seconds"" after equipment was available. EDMD 1 stated the Broselow tape was a ""mechanical mechanism to measure and weigh a child..and gives the doses for all medications"". EDMD 1 stated that EDNP 1 called the NICU and IMD. EDMD 1 stated that he had EMTALA training ""two months ago"". EDMD 1 stated EMTALA ""has to do with transferring patients and prevent dumping of patients"". EDMD 1 stated that he was board ceritified in emergency medicine and it was not required to have certifications on pediatric and neonatal CPR and resuscitation.

LDMD stated an infant born at ""26 weeks is viable [can survive]"". LDMD stated a premature infant with a heart rate and respiratory rate would be ""considered still alive and would resuscitate [perform CPR]"". LDMD stated that an infant that turns pink after intubation indicates ""good oxygenation ...perfusion [blood flow and oxygen to the body] is good"". LDMD stated the Broselow ""grey colored zone"" was ""not for a 26 week"" premature infant. LDMD stated that she was ""not familiar with atropine being in the ""neonatal resuscitation algorithm [standard of care of CPR on a newborn]"". LDMD stated that a 26 week ""baby could be saved"" and it appeared the [Hospital] ""panicked"". 

Review of ""Medical Staff Rules and Regulations"", last revision 9/20/2011, indicated [Hospital] medical staff will follow Regulations Policy and Procedures outlined in the COBRA/EMTALA Regulations, section Medical Screening Exam: ""The process required to reach within a reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether an emergency medical condition exists or a woman is in labor. The Medical Screening Exam is an ongoing process, including monitoring of the individual, until the individual is stabilized or transferred"".

Review of the [Hospital] policy titled, ""Transfer of individual with or without an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) EMTALA"", effective 10/10/2018, approved 10/18/2018, next review 10/10/2019. The policy indicated [Hospital] ""will comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ... Capability: The physical space, equipment, staff, supplies and services (e.g., surgery, intensive care, pediatrics, obstetrics and psychiatry) ... To stabilize: With respect to emergency condition, to either provide such medical treatment of the condition ...Stable for Transfer... the treating physician has determined, with reasonable clinical confidence that an individual i.e., expected to leave the Hospital and be received at the second Hospital, with no material deterioration of his/her medical condition..."" 

Review of the [Hospital] policy titled, ""Acceptance/interhospital Transfer Procedure"", effective 5/5/2016, approved 5/5/2016, next review 5/17/2017. indicated the ""physician's responsibilities ...""provide an examination and necessary stabilizing treatment"". Review of national guidelines, according to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the nation's leading group of physicians that provides guidelines and the standard of care, indicate ""stillborn infant has been defined as a child of at least 20 weeks gestation or at least 400 gm weight at delivery which has not breathed after delivery. The criterion of life is the presence of a heartbeat after complete expulsion or extraction of the child from its mother. The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics defines fetal death as the delivery of a fetus showing no signs of life as indicated by the absence of breathing, heartbeats, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movements of voluntary muscles."" https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/obstetric-care consensus/articles/2020/03/management-of-stillbirth. Accessed 04/20/2022.

Review of national guidelines, according to Part 5: Neonatal Resuscitation 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary (CPR). The guidelines indicated the Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care for Newborn resuscitation: 1. Most newly born infants do not require immediate cord clamping or resuscitation. 2. Inflation and ventilation of the lungs are the priority in newly born infants who need support after birth. 3. Heart rate is assessed initially by auscultation and/or palpation. 4 Assessment of Heart Rate. 5. Electrocardiography is an important adjuncts in babies requiring resuscitation. 6. Pulse oximetry is used to guide oxygen therapy and meet oxygen saturation goals. 7. PPV remains the primary method for providing support for newborns who are apneic, bradycardic, or demonstrate inadequate respiratory effort. Most babies will respond to this intervention. PPV may be initiated with air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies, and up to 30% oxygen in preterm babies. 8. Chest compressions are provided if there is a poor heart rate response to ventilation after appropriate ventilation corrective steps, which preferably include endotracheal intubation. 9. The heart rate response to chest compressions and medications should be monitored electrocardiographically. 10. If the response to chest compressions is poor, it may be reasonable to provide epinephrine, preferably via the intravenous route. 11. Failure to respond to epinephrine in a newborn with history or examination consistent with blood loss may require volume expansion. 12. When vascular access is required in the newly born, the umbilical venous route is preferred. When intravenous access is not feasible, the intraosseous route may be considered. 13. Medications, if the heart rate remains less than 60/min despite 60 seconds of chest compressions and adequate PPV, epinephrine should be administered, ideally via the intravenous route. Atropine is not indicated in the guidelines. 14. If all these steps of resuscitation are effectively completed and there is no heart rate response by 20 minutes, redirection of care should be discussed with the team and family.

Review of peer review article Journal of Anesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology, the article indicated that if an atropine dose of 0.02 mg/kg was given to an1 kg neonate, the neonate would receive a 5-fold over-dose of atropine. The article also indicated -very low doses of atropine (3.6 µg/kg or less) might cause slowing of the heart rate and paradoxical bradycardia.

Based on interview and record review the facility failed to ensure:
A. accurate information was provided to a receiving hospital about an emergency transfer involving a unstable pregnant female in imminent delivery. 
B. ensure the physician certification contained a summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.
This deficient practice was found in 1 of 1 patients (Patient #12) and had the likelihood to cause harm in all pregnant patients presenting to the emergency room   .

Findings include:

Review of the emergency room    nurses notes revealed Patient #12 was a [AGE] year old female who (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:29 a.m. with presenting problems of pelvic pain and pregnant.
Review of the nurse's triage notes timed 9:30 a.m., revealed the following documentation about Patient #12:
""Pt brought via wheelchair back to restroom. Pt of normal stature with swollen abdomen, and complaints of severe left groin pain and abdominal pain overnight and more severe this AM. Pt denies pregnancy and states she took a morning after pill in October and has not had a full period since that time. Pt states she has spotted several times and mother confirms negative home pregnancy test in December.""
At 9:37 a.m., underneath the physician's physical exam the following was documented:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  ... ""Patient appears in pain, in moderate pain distress."" ...
ABDOMEN FEMALE: ""Abdominal exam included findings of abdomen tender, to the left lower quadrant, moderate intensity,"" ... ""Peritoneal signs present, guarding present, Rovsing's sign absent.""
PELVIC: ""Bimanual exam abnormal, Cervix dilated greater than 6 cm, No cervical motion tenderness, No adrenal mass, Uterus above umbilicus, can palpate head at cervix, Urethral exam normal. Bladder exam normal, no tenderness, Escorted by RN, ...., no mass, head at 0 station, cervix is effaced.. Not crowning.""

At 9:50 a.m., nurses documented ""Dr. #5 remains at bedside FHT completed at 156, he completed a visual on US and heart beat appears strong and baby appears to be in correct position. Pt cervix checked by Dr. #5 pt fully dilated, pt denies need to push .c/o constant pain with periods of increased pain. Contractions are 2-3 minutes apart. Family at bedside update on POC. Pt tolerating well states took 2 hydrocodone prior to arrival, respirations easy unlabored and no distress noted.""
At 10:07 a.m., nurse notes showed documentation of ""MD #5 assessment, pt's cervix complete and fetal head is balottable.""
At 10:08 a.m. ... ""EMS was present in room to transport.""
At 10:12 a.m., underneath doctor notes there was documentation of ""Crowning at cervix; fully dilated. Blood at the introitus.""
At 10:12 a.m.,""Dr. #5 discussed with Dr. #7 to accept pt even though she is in active labor.
At 10:15 a.m., ""Pt moved to a larger room. Pt having small amount of blood discharge. Dr. #5 at bedside and completed FHT at 167 and again checked the pt with no change in labor status. Pts contractions remain at 2-3 mins apart. Pt tolerating well, respirations easy unlabored and family at side. Receiving hospital Dr. #7 has spoke to Dr. #5 and accepted, pt awaiting Admin approval and EMS.""
At 10:18 a.m., ""Pt left with... EMS.""
At 10:18 a.m., ""EMS at bedside and Admin approved transfer because pt is not delivering at this time. No crowning noted and baby still remains high up, contractions are 2 mins apart ....
At 10:19 a.m., underneath doctor notes the following was documented ""pt at near term pregnancy with no PNC, not in labor. Ctxns were 4-5 mins apart but no progress in station of baby. Receiving hospital accepted and pt enroute now. Pt re-examined prior to transfer and no further movement of child, still feels to be at 0 station, fht at 148.""
Review of Memorandum of Transfer revealed the physician signed the ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" section, but failed to check the reason in the area for Summary of Risks and Benefits"".
According to documentation there were discrepancies in the assessments on if the baby was crowning and how far Patient #12 had dilated. There was no assessment of how long the contractions were lasting and no documentation of an evaluation of the membranes being intact or not. The physician failed to complete the certification on Patient #12.

""In compliance with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (""the Act""), every patient who comes to the Emergency Department is entitled to an appropriate medical screening examination to determine whether the patient suffers from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor (i.e., pregnancy with contractions present). If either condition is present, qualified medical personnel will provide treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition regardless of the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. The emergency needs of the patient will be met according to acceptable standards of medical practice. A medical screening examination sufficient to detect the presence of an emergency medical condition or active labor will be performed by qualified medical personnel, which will be the attending ER  physician. The attending physician is ultimately responsible for screening examinations. If, after the screening examination, in the best medical judgement of the provider, the patient is not in active labor and no emergency condition is present, the patient will be treated, referred or transferred according to the internal Emergency Department or Ambulatory Services procedures and appropriate standards of medical practice.

Based on interview and record review the facility failed to ensure:
A. accurate information was provided to a receiving hospital about an emergency transfer involving a unstable pregnant female in imminent delivery. 
B. ensure the physician certification contained a summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.
This deficient practice was found in 1 of 1 patients (Patient #12) and had the likelihood to cause harm in all pregnant patients presenting to the emergency room   .

Findings include:

Review of the emergency room    nurses notes revealed Patient #12 was a [AGE] year old female who (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:29 a.m. with presenting problems of pelvic pain and pregnant.
Review of the nurse's triage notes timed 9:30 a.m., revealed the following documentation about Patient #12:
""Pt brought via wheelchair back to restroom. Pt of normal stature with swollen abdomen, and complaints of severe left groin pain and abdominal pain overnight and more severe this AM. Pt denies pregnancy and states she took a morning after pill in October and has not had a full period since that time. Pt states she has spotted several times and mother confirms negative home  in December.""
At 9:37 a.m., underneath the physician's physical exam the following was documented:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  ... ""Patient appears in pain, in moderate pain distress."" ...
ABDOMEN FEMALE: ""Abdominal exam included findings of abdomen tender, to the left lower quadrant, moderate intensity,"" ... ""Peritoneal signs present, guarding present, Rovsing's sign absent.""
PELVIC: ""Bimanual exam abnormal, Cervix dilated greater than 6 cm, No cervical motion tenderness, No adrenal mass, Uterus above umbilicus, can palpate head at cervix, Urethral exam normal. Bladder exam normal, no tenderness, Escorted by RN, ...., no mass, head at 0 station, cervix is effaced.. Not crowning.""

At 9:50 a.m., nurses documented ""Dr. #5 remains at bedside FHT completed at 156, he completed a visual on US and heart beat appears strong and baby appears to be in correct position. Pt cervix checked by Dr. #5 pt fully dilated, pt denies need to push .c/o constant pain with periods of increased pain. Contractions are 2-3 minutes apart. Family at bedside update on POC. Pt tolerating well states took 2 hydrocodone prior to arrival, respirations easy unlabored and no distress noted.""
At 10:07 a.m., nurse notes showed documentation of ""MD #5 assessment, pt's cervix complete and fetal head is balottable.""
At 10:08 a.m. ... ""EMS was present in room to transport.""
At 10:12 a.m., underneath doctor notes there was documentation of ""Crowning at cervix; fully dilated. Blood at the introitus.""
At 10:12 a.m.,""Dr. #5 discussed with Dr. #7 to accept pt even though she is in active labor.
At 10:15 a.m., ""Pt moved to a larger room. Pt having small amount of blood discharge. Dr. #5 at bedside and completed FHT at 167 and again checked the pt with no change in labor status. Pts contractions remain at 2-3 mins apart. Pt tolerating well, respirations easy unlabored and family at side.

At 10:18 a.m., ""Pt left with... EMS.""
At 10:18 a.m., ""EMS at bedside and Admin approved transfer because pt is not delivering at this time. No crowning noted and baby still remains high up, contractions are 2 mins apart ....
At 10:19 a.m., underneath doctor notes the following was documented ""pt at near term pregnancy with no PNC, not in labor. Ctxns were 4-5 mins apart but no progress in station of baby. Receiving hospital accepted and pt enroute now. Pt re-examined prior to transfer and no further movement of child, still feels to be at 0 station, fht at 148.""
Review of Memorandum of Transfer revealed the physician signed the ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" section, but failed to check the reason in the area for Summary of Risks and Benefits"".
According to documentation there were discrepancies in the assessments on if the baby was crowning and how far Patient #12 had dilated. There was no assessment of how long the contractions were lasting and no documentation of an evaluation of the membranes being intact or not. The physician failed to complete the certification on Patient #12.
