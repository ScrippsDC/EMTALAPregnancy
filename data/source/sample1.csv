Based on documentation and interviews, the hospital failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department received an appropriate medical screening examination without delay, in one of twenty-two patients reviewed (patient #1). Patient #1's   medical screening examination, which included a pelvic exam and corresponding treatment related to her pregnancy, was not provided to patient #1 for two and one half hours after her arrival at the ED. Findings include:

Patient #1's emergency department (ED) record was reviewed and revealed that patient #1, who was thirteen weeks pregnant with her first child, presented to the ED's triage area on 9/28/12 at 11:28 p.m. with complaints of bilateral, cramping, abdominal pain that radiated to her lower back. Patient #1 reported that she had been having ongoing vaginal spotting for the duration of the pregnancy and that the bleeding increased yesterday. The patient told triage nurse (E) that the vaginal bleeding was bright red today, and the amount of bleeding increased at 10:00 p.m. this evening while she was at home. The patient described her pain level at 5/10 with the pain increasing to 10 plus at intervals. 

The ED record revealed that following her arrival at the ED, patient #1 was told to wait in the waiting room until further treatment could be provided. Patient #1 waited for forty minutes in the waiting room. Within the next one hour and thirty minutes, patient #1 was moved to two different exam rooms, and she continued to wait to be seen by the provider, nurse practitioner (G). Patient #1 did not receive any pain medication for one hour and forty minutes after her arrival at the ED. A pelvic exam and further treatment was not provided to patient #1 for two and one half hours after her arrival at the ED. Following the pelvic exam  patient #1 was taken to the Operating Room at  approximately 4:00 a.m. on 9/29/12, and  physician (F) performed a D & C on patient #1. 

Patient #1 was interviewed by phone on 10/25/12, and she stated she arrived at the ED at approximately 11:00 p.m. on 9/28/12. She was thirteen weeks pregnant with her first child and her water broke at 9:00 p.m. that evening.  She was having severe abdominal pain (she stated the contractions were every ten minutes) and bleeding when she arrived at the ED. She stated she was crying when she was explaining her symptoms to triage nurse (E). Nurse (E) told patient #1 that he had checked with another staff person and was told that there was not an exam room available for patient #1. Nurse (E) told patient #1 to wait in the waiting room. Patient #1 stated it was extremely difficult to sit in the chair in the waiting room because she was having contractions and was shaking and felt like she was going to faint. She went to the bathroom a couple of times while she was in the waiting room and noted that the bleeding continued to be very heavy. She stated she waited for approximately one hour in the waiting room and was moved to a small exam room where she waited for another hour and then was moved to a large exam room. She stated she was screaming while she was in the large exam room. Nurse practitioner (G) entered the room following an additional fifteen minute wait, and patient #1 received two doses of pain medication via an IV. Patient #1 stated nurse practitioner (G) performed a pelvic exam on her about two and one half hours after patient #1 arrived at the ED, and nurse practitioner (G) removed blood clots and the fetus during the exam. Patient #1 stated there was a delay in providing treatment to her when she arrived at the ED. She stated having a miscarriage was a very traumatic experience, and the delay in treating her ""made it even more awful.""  She stated she wondered why she even bothered to go to the ED. 

Nurse (E) was interviewed by phone on 11/1/12, and he stated he was working as the triage nurse on the evening of 9/28/12. The ED was very busy that evening. Patient #1 was bleeding and in a lot of pain when she arrived at the ED that evening. Due to patient #1's symptoms, patient #1 should have been promptly seen following her arrival at the ED, but patient #1 had to wait because there was not an available exam room. Nurse (E) stated patients in the ED that evening probably could have been transferred to other areas/rooms in order to free up an exam room for patient #1 following her arrival at the ED.

Nurse (C) was interviewed in person on 10/30/12 and by phone on 11/1/12. He stated he reviewed the incident, and he determined that considering patient #1's condition on 9/28/12 and 9/29/12, her wait time in the ED was too long, and she should have received care more promptly. He stated he plans to provide education to staff related to the incident and the specific needs of the obstetrical patient in the ED.

Nurse Practitioner (G) was unavailable for an interview during the investigation.

She was thirteen weeks pregnant with her first child and her water broke at 9:00 p.m. that evening.  She was having severe abdominal pain (she stated the contractions were every ten minutes) and bleeding when she arrived at the ED. She stated she was crying when she was explaining her symptoms to triage nurse (E). Nurse (E) told patient #1 that he had checked with another staff person and was told that there was not an exam room available for patient #1. Nurse (E) told patient #1 to wait in the waiting room. Patient #1 stated it was extremely difficult to sit in the chair in the waiting room because she was having contractions and was shaking and felt like she was going to faint. She went to the bathroom a couple of times while she was in the waiting room and noted that the bleeding continued to be very heavy. She stated she waited for approximately one hour in the waiting room and was moved to a small exam room where she waited for another hour and then was moved to a large exam room. She stated she was screaming while she was in the large exam room. Nurse practitioner (G) entered the room following an additional fifteen minute wait, and patient #1 received two doses of pain medication via an IV. Patient #1 stated nurse practitioner (G) performed a pelvic exam on her about two and one half hours after patient #1 arrived at the ED, and nurse practitioner (G) removed blood clots and the fetus during the exam. Patient #1 stated there was a delay in providing treatment to her when she arrived at the ED. She stated having a miscarriage was a very traumatic experience, and the delay in treating her ""made it even more awful.""  She stated she wondered why she even bothered to go to the ED. 

Nurse (E) was interviewed by phone on 11/1/12, and he stated he was working as the triage nurse on the evening of 9/28/12. The ED was very busy that evening. Patient #1 was bleeding and in a lot of pain when she arrived at the ED that evening. Due to patient #1's symptoms, patient #1 should have been promptly seen following her arrival at the ED, but patient #1 had to wait because there was not an available exam room. Nurse (E) stated patients in the ED that evening probably could have been transferred to other areas/rooms in order to free up an exam room for patient #1 following her arrival at the ED.

Nurse (C) was interviewed in person on 10/30/12 and by phone on 11/1/12. He stated he reviewed the incident, and he determined that considering patient #1's condition on 9/28/12 and 9/29/12, her wait time in the ED was too long, and she should have received care more promptly. He stated he plans to provide education to staff related to the incident and the specific needs of the obstetrical patient in the ED.

Nurse Practitioner (G) was unavailable for an interview during the investigation.

Based upon record review and interview, the facility failed to ensure 1 (#1) of 30 patients' medical records reviewed had received an appropriate medical screening examination in the Emergency Department and failed to follow the facility policy. 

Findings at Health Facility A on 09/04/2013:

Review of policy titled, ""Medical Screening Exam and Referral in the Emergency Department; Reference #1202 a: DATE Effective: 10/2011"" revealed: 

""Purpose: The purpose of the medical screening examination (MSE) is to determine with reasonable clinical confidence and within the capability of the Emergency Department (and the ancillary services routinely available to the Emergency Department) whether or not an individual who comes to the Emergency Department has an emergency medical condition. The MSE will be performed in a non-discriminatory manner, by qualified medical personnel as detailed below.

Policy Statement: All individuals presenting to be seen in the Emergency Department will be provided an appropriate MSE by Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP). A QMP includes physicians and nurses who are members of the medical staff who practice within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors, Medical Staff, Texas Medical Board, and Texas Board of Nursing. This includes but is not limited to the scope of licensure, certification, education and experience of the QMP. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or Emergency Department registered nurses who have received specialized training, demonstrated appropriate competence for performing appropriate MSE's will function under standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.

Based on whether the patient meets any exclusion criteria and the results of this MSE, the patient may either be directed to the Rural Health Clinic or Emergency Department for further medical examination and treatment. If an emergency medical condition is determined to exist, the hospital will provide any necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer.

The MSE must be the same MSE that would be performed on any individual coming to the Emergency Department, regardless of the individual's ability to pay. No information regarding the patients' payer status, HMO/PPO membership, or insurance shall be asked prior to the completion of the MSE.

After patients presenting to the ED will have a MSE completed by a QMP. This screening examination may be performed in the Emergency Department by a registered nurse who has been determined by the Chief Nursing Office and Emergency Department Nurse Manager to be qualified and experienced in emergency nursing and who is required to follow standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.  In the event the registered nurse performing the screening examination is uncertain about the nature of the patient's condition or the existence of an emergency, the patient will be referred to the Emergency Department physician for further screening.

The nature of the MSE will depend on the patient's presenting symptoms, and may only a brief history and physical examination.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Triage Log"" from 03/01/2013 thru 08/31/2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the triage log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Elopement Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the elopement log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Transfer Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the transfer log.

A review of twenty-nine medical records at Health Facility A revealed no medical record for patient #1. 

Findings at Health Facility B on 09/05/2013 at 8:30 AM:

A review of patient #1's medical record at Health Facility B revealed patient was admitted on [DATE] at 9:50 PM. Nurses notes revealed ""After triage, this patient informed me that she had presented to triage at Health Facility A, and was told that  ""we can't help you here."" States she was told they did not do OB (obstetrics), and could not do ultrasounds and that they were too busy to see her at all for several hours and that she should go to Mount Pleasant. She also states that as they were passing through Pittsburg, they called ahead to Pittsburg, and were told by the ER  (emergency room   ) there that they too did not ""do babies"" and that she should go on to Mount Pleasant.""  

According to the labor and delivery admission assessment for patient #1, the assessment stated, ""pt (patient) admitted     to ldr1 (labor room #1) with c/o (complaints) of contractions, states receives prenatal care in Longview. Pt crying and restless with contractions, strong contractions palpated, sve (sterile vaginal examination) reveals bulging membranes and almost completely dilated. Patient's boyfriend and his mother arrived with pt. They are visibly upset and crying about inevitable, nonviable delivery and being ""turned away from Gilmer."" Mother states they stopped at Health Facility A (ER) first and were turned away. When questioned further the mother states that when they signed in to the ER  they were told that the hospital does not delivery babies and that the ER  was very busy trying ""to save someone's life"" and it would be ""hours and hours"" before the patient would be able to be seen. The patient was advised to go to either Longview or Mount Pleasant hospital to be seen by a hospital that delivers babies. The patient, her boyfriend and his mother then left and started on their way to Mount Pleasant. En route to Mount Pleasant the mother called Pittsburg ER  via mobile phone and inquired about whether they should stop there. They were told the best place would be Mount Pleasant since they were already on their way and Mount Pleasant delivered babies. Due to patient's condition, this information was obtained by the paternal grandmother of the fetus to which the patient agrees.""  

Patient delivered spontaneous vaginal delivery 20 week fetal demise on August 19, 2013 at 6:17 AM. Patient discharged    home from Health Facility B on 08/21/2013 at 9:41 AM.   

A phone interview with family member #16 on 09/05/2013 at 10:30 AM stated, ""My son called and said we are on our way to the emergency room    in Gilmer my girlfriend is having bad cramps. I told him I was on my way, and when I drove up to the emergency room    in Gilmer, my son and his girlfriend were coming out the door of the emergency room   . They told me this emergency room    doesn't deliver babies and we would have to go to Longview or Mount Pleasant. I chose Mount Pleasant because it's a better road and it's a straight shot. On the way I called Pittsburg emergency room    because it's on the way to Mount Pleasant and my son's girlfriend was hurting so bad.  They informed me they don't deliver babies either and I need to go on to Mount Pleasant. So we went to Mount Pleasant Hospital.""

A phone interview with patient #1 on 09/05/2013 at 11:10 AM stated, ""I went to the Gilmer emergency room    on   Sunday August 18th around 8:00 PM with my boyfriend. I was having bad cramping. I sat down where you register for an emergency room    visit. I signed a piece of paper. The clerk told me ""I didn't tell you this, but it will be hours before someone sees you because the emergency room    is busy and they are trying ""to save someone's life."" We don't take care of babies here."" The clerk told me Mount Pleasant or Longview is the closest place. My boyfriend and I left. My boyfriend's mother drove us to Mount Pleasant. Patient #1 was questioned did you see a nurse or physician before you left? She stated, ""No.""

On a return visit back to Health Facility A on 09/05/2013 at 12:00 PM requested the emergency room    clerk schedule. Staff member #17 was the admitting clerk working the evening of August 18th, date in question.

A phone interview with staff #17 on 09/05/2013 at 12:10 PM stated, ""I remember patient #1 because she left her social security card that night. It is in the top drawer where I sit in the second registration desk area. Staff member #17 was questioned did patient #1 sign into the emergency room   . Staff #17 stated, she signed the piece of paper that asks for name, date of birth, social security#, and reason for visit. I remember there was patient behind her saying why are you checking into this hospital they don't deliver babies. I had to leave the area and take papers to the nurses in the emergency room   . When I came back the patient asked me if this hospital delivers babies? I am not supposed to give out any information, but when patient asks a direct question I can answer. So I told her, ""no we don't deliver babies here, the closest places are Longview and Mount Pleasant."" They got up and left. Staff member #17 was questioned as to what happened to the piece of paper the patient signed? She stated, ""I put it in the shred box when they left."" Staff #17 was questioned as to whether patient saw a nurse or a physician? She stated, ""No.""

An interview with the Director of the Emergency Department on 09/05/2013 at 12:30 PM confirmed, if any patient had presented to the emergency room    the patient would have been registered by the clerk and the patient would have signed the paper that request name, date of birth, social security #, and reason for visit. 

On 09/05/2013 at 12:35 PM the emergency room    Manager and I went to the emergency room    registration area. We found the patient's original social security card in the top drawer of the second registration desk, where staff member #17 told me she had placed it.

An interview with the Administrator, Chief Nursing Officer, and the emergency room    Manager, confirmed the patient #1 original social security card was left at the registration desk. Patient #1 had not received a medical screening, nor was the patient on the triage log, elopement log, and transfer log. Also the facility policy for medical screening examinations had not been followed.

Based on interview, review of documentation in 4 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCHHC to another hospital for specialty services not available at SCHHC (Patients 1, 4, 12 and 20) and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved. The following required appropriate transfer elements were not carried out:
* It was unclear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capability had been provided.
* The receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient for further examination and stabilizing treatment within the receiving hospital's capability and capacity.
* There was no physician certification, or the physician certification lacked patient specific and individualized medical benefits vs patient specific risks of transfer.
* Transfers were not affected using appropriate transportation with qualified personnel and necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during transfer. 
* Medical records were not sent to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The hospital's organizational chart dated 01/11/2019 and the hospital's website reflected that the hospital provided medical, surgical, respiratory, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency and swing-bed services. Services provided did not include obstetrical services. 

2. There were no policies and procedures that complied with EMTALA requirements to ensure that all patients for whom an MSE determined required further examination and stabilizing treatment not within the capability or capacity of SCHHC would receive an appropriate transfer to another hospital that had the capability and capacity. Policies and procedures provided were unclear, incomplete and inaccurate. Those policies and procedures were not customized for SCHHC and did not clearly and accurately reflect provisions to ensure the hospital's compliance with its obligations under EMTALA. The only references to appropriate transfers were in the following three documents: 

a. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Obstetric triage of patients"" was dated as revised 02/16/2018 and contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""Having specific procedures for obstetric triage ensures compliance with Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) regulations, which require health care practitioners to examine a patient to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, to provide necessary stabilizing treatment when an emergency medical condition is identified, and to stabilize the patient or, if a practitioner certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, arrange for proper transfer to another facility. In addition, hospitals are prohibited from delaying patient assessment and treatment because of a patient's insurance coverage or ability to pay. Under EMTALA, a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other qualified medical professional (acting within the scope of practice and state law) is required to certify all patient assessments and dispositions."" 

This procedure contained the following reference to transfers that reflected ""If the patient is to be transferred to another facility: Ensure that the patient has been informed of the risks involved and has signed a consent form for transfer. Confirm that permissions has been obtained from both facilities, that the practitioner has certified in writing that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, that the patient's necessary medical records will accompany her, and that any necessary equipment and qualified personnel will be present during transport. Make sure that the reconciled list of the patient's medications has been communicated to the next practitioner who will be caring for the patient...Make sure that handoff communication is provided to the person who will assume responsibility for the patient's care and that it is documented in the patient's medical record."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the 10-page document. 

b. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Patient Transfer"" contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""To provide guidelines for the safe transfer of patients to another facility in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations including but not limited to Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), as well as industry best practices...Patients may be transferred from [SCHHC] for a variety of reasons including patient's condition requiring treatment not available at SCHHC or patient request...Provider makes decision to transfer patient to another facility and determines appropriateness of transfer, in accordance with all federal and state regulations...Provider contacts receiving provide for patient acceptance and gives report to receiving provider. Provider completes appropriate transfer form...Hospital staff arranges for patient transportation via provider designated level of transportation...Nursing staff copies patient's visit information including, as applicable: [all medical record documentation]..."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the document. 

c. The SCHHC ""Medical Staff Rules & Regulations"" dated as approved on 01/12/2016 contained the following reference to EMTALA transfers: 
* ""[SCHHC], in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), along with all members of the Medical Staff, will comply with the policies regarding patient transfers and shall comply with all applicable laws regarding patient transfers."" 

There was no other information related to EMTALA transfers.

3. a. The ED medical record of Patient 20 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 0805 and included the following documentation related to Patient 20's ED encounter:
* At 0825 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that the patient was ""37.3 weeks pregnant, not feeling baby kick x 2 days,"" the patient's BP was 149/94, and ""Dopplered baby HR, started at 80bpm finished at 144bmp (sic).""
* At 0847 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""ER Disposition...Diagnosis: Decreased fetal movement...discharged   ...You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation.""
* At 0850 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that ""Pt concerned with baby not kicking much x2 days, doppler heartrate 80bpm with contraction, 144bpm otherwise. Instructed to go to BAH right away after discharge.""
* At 0855 Patient 20 signed an ""ED Discharge Instructions"" document that reflected ""Discharge Instructions...Diagnosis: Decreased Fetal movement...Disposition: discharged   ; Condition: Stable; Diagnosis Specific Education: Diagnosis related handout given; Medication Risks, Benefits, Alternatives; You should go directly to Bay Area Hospital for further evaluation."" 
* At 0904 an MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""Patient is 37 weeks pregnant and presents stating that [he/she] has felt decreased fetal movements for the past couple of days and wants to make sure the baby has a heartbeat. Up until this point, there have been no complications with the pregnancy. [He/she] has not had any pain. No vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluids...Limited bedside ultrasound performed to assess fetal viability. Fetus had decreased activity. FHR initially was around 120-140. However, while the probe was still on the abdomen, the HR dropped to around the 80's. The patient stated [he/she] felt like [he/she] may be having a contraction. This is a sign of fetal distress, and I instructed the patient to go directly to Bay Area Hospital for OB eval, likely NST. The patient was here with [his/her] sibling], who will take [Patient 20] directly to Bay Area...Disposition: discharged   , Condition: Stable."" 
* There was no transfer form required by the transfer policy identified under finding 2. b. above.

There was no documentation in the ED medical record, including on the transfer form required by hospital transfer procedures, to reflect that an appropriate transfer had been affected:

d. According to an article on the NCBI NHI website dated September 2014: ""Penile fracture is an uncommon urological trauma,,,It is defined as a rupture of the tunica albuginea due to trauma or abrupt lateral bending of the penis in an erect state...Classic features include the patient reporting an audible 'popping' sound, rapid detumescence, pain, penile swelling and deviation of the penis often to the side opposite the injury secondary to mass effect of the hematoma at the injury site. Following injury, if Buck's fascia remains intact, the hematoma develops and results in the characteristic 'eggplant deformity.' The defect at the fracture site is often palpable and has been described as the 'rolling sign.' This represents a firm, mobile, tender mass, where the penile skin can be rolled over the blood clot. An ultrasound has a limited role in penile fractures, but useful in penile penetrating injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging has been highly accurate to demonstrate corpus cavernosum lesions. Urinalysis was done in all cases of penile fracture patients to exclude urethral injury that was then confirmed by ascending urethrography/urethroscopy. This is in accordance with the international recommendation on urethral injury with a fracture penis. The incidence of urethral injury is between 20% to 38%. Treatment is immediate surgical repair because the complication rate of conservative management is 25% to 53%....early surgical management in penile fracture cases provides better results than delayed and conservatively managed cases.""

6. The ED medical record of Patient 4 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1125 and included the following documentation related to Patient 4's encounter:

","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  

Based on interview, review of documentation in 4 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from SCHHC to another hospital for specialty services not available at SCHHC (Patients 1, 4, 12 and 20) and review of hospital policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved. The following required appropriate transfer elements were not carried out:
* It was unclear whether stabilizing treatment within the hospital's capability had been provided.
* The receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient for further examination and stabilizing treatment within the receiving hospital's capability and capacity.
* There was no physician certification, or the physician certification lacked patient specific and individualized medical benefits vs patient specific risks of transfer.
* Transfers were not affected using appropriate transportation with qualified personnel and necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during transfer. 
* Medical records were not sent to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The hospital's organizational chart dated 01/11/2019 and the hospital's website reflected that the hospital provided medical, surgical, respiratory, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency and swing-bed services. Services provided did not include obstetrical services. 

2. There were no policies and procedures that complied with EMTALA requirements to ensure that all patients for whom an MSE determined required further examination and stabilizing treatment not within the capability or capacity of SCHHC would receive an appropriate transfer to another hospital that had the capability and capacity. Policies and procedures provided were unclear, incomplete and inaccurate. Those policies and procedures were not customized for SCHHC and did not clearly and accurately reflect provisions to ensure the hospital's compliance with its obligations under EMTALA. The only references to appropriate transfers were in the following three documents: 

a. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Obstetric triage of patients"" was dated as revised 02/16/2018 and contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""Having specific procedures for obstetric triage ensures compliance with Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) regulations, which require health care practitioners to examine a patient to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, to provide necessary stabilizing treatment when an emergency medical condition is identified, and to stabilize the patient or, if a practitioner certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, arrange for proper transfer to another facility. In addition, hospitals are prohibited from delaying patient assessment and treatment because of a patient's insurance coverage or ability to pay. Under EMTALA, a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other qualified medical professional (acting within the scope of practice and state law) is required to certify all patient assessments and dispositions."" 

This procedure contained the following reference to transfers that reflected ""If the patient is to be transferred to another facility: Ensure that the patient has been informed of the risks involved and has signed a consent form for transfer. Confirm that permissions has been obtained from both facilities, that the practitioner has certified in writing that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, that the patient's necessary medical records will accompany her, and that any necessary equipment and qualified personnel will be present during transport. Make sure that the reconciled list of the patient's medications has been communicated to the next practitioner who will be caring for the patient...Make sure that handoff communication is provided to the person who will assume responsibility for the patient's care and that it is documented in the patient's medical record."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the 10-page document. 

b. An undated ""Lippincott Procedure"" titled ""Patient Transfer"" contained the following reference to EMTALA: ""To provide guidelines for the safe transfer of patients to another facility in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations including but not limited to Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), as well as industry best practices...Patients may be transferred from [SCHHC] for a variety of reasons including patient's condition requiring treatment not available at SCHHC or patient request...Provider makes decision to transfer patient to another facility and determines appropriateness of transfer, in accordance with all federal and state regulations...Provider contacts receiving provide for patient acceptance and gives report to receiving provider. Provider completes appropriate transfer form...Hospital staff arranges for patient transportation via provider designated level of transportation...Nursing staff copies patient's visit information including, as applicable: [all medical record documentation]..."" There were were no other references to EMTALA appropriate transfer requirements in the document. 

c. The SCHHC ""Medical Staff Rules & Regulations"" dated as approved on 01/12/2016 contained the following reference to EMTALA transfers: 
* ""[SCHHC], in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), along with all members of the Medical Staff, will comply with the policies regarding patient transfers and shall comply with all applicable laws regarding patient transfers."" 

There was no other information related to EMTALA transfers.

However, review of the ED record for Patient 12 reflected that the ED MD consulted the BAH urologist on call and sent the patient to the BAH urologist for further examination and stabilizing treatment. The log did not accurately reflect the reason the patient presented and did not reflect that the patient was sent ""immediately"" to another hospital's on-call physician. Refer to Tag C2405 that reflects the central log for Patient 12 was not accurate.  

d. According to an article on the NCBI NHI website dated September 2014: ""Penile fracture is an uncommon urological trauma,,,It is defined as a rupture of the tunica albuginea due to trauma or abrupt lateral bending of the penis in an erect state...Classic features include the patient reporting an audible 'popping' sound, rapid detumescence, pain, penile swelling and deviation of the penis often to the side opposite the injury secondary to mass effect of the hematoma at the injury site. Following injury, if Buck's fascia remains intact, the hematoma develops and results in the characteristic 'eggplant deformity.' The defect at the fracture site is often palpable and has been described as the 'rolling sign.' This represents a firm, mobile, tender mass, where the penile skin can be rolled over the blood clot. An ultrasound has a limited role in penile fractures, but useful in penile penetrating injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging has been highly accurate to demonstrate corpus cavernosum lesions. Urinalysis was done in all cases of penile fracture patients to exclude urethral injury that was then confirmed by ascending urethrography/urethroscopy. This is in accordance with the international recommendation on urethral injury with a fracture penis. The incidence of urethral injury is between 20% to 38%. Treatment is immediate surgical repair because the complication rate of conservative management is 25% to 53%....early surgical management in penile fracture cases provides better results than delayed and conservatively managed cases.""

6. The ED medical record of Patient 4 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1125 and included the following documentation related to Patient 4's encounter:
* At 1138 an RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Triage"" note that ""Pt states was assaulted last noc...Pt c/o HA, neck pain, low back pain; Feels stiff all over; Pt states [he/she] think [he/she] was unconscious for a second secondary to being choked. Pt noted to have black eye left side; Back tender to palpation upper and lower; Neck tender to palpation; no obvious deformities noted..Pt states [he/she] has many psychological problems.""
* At 2018 the RN documented on an ""ED Nursing Documentation"" note that Patient 4 had ""Suicidal ideation, Flight of ideas.""
* At 0037 on 09/07/2018 an RN documented that the patient had ""Suicidal ideation, before falling asleep patient mentioned that [he/she] has attempted suicide in the past by cutting and trying to hang [him/herself].""
* At 0839 on 09/07/2018 the ED MD documented on an ""ED Provider Note"" that ""Patient with prolonged stay in the ED due to lack of psych beds. [He/she] continues suicidal and homicidal...1040 Patient evaluated by mental health, they consider patient is at risk for suicide and [he/she] should be admitted     to a psychiatric unit. care discussed with [psychiatrist] from Good Samaritan Hospital in Corvallis, [psychiatrist] accepted the patient for transfer.""
* At 1800 on 09/07/2018 the MD documented on the ""Patient Transfer Form"" that ""Benefit(s) of transfer: psych evaluation/treatment...Risk(s) of transfer (in addition to deterioration of patient's condition/clinically specific): Accident...Risks of transport: All transfers have the inherent risks of traffic delays, accident during transport..."" 

The documentation reflected that an appropriate transfer had not been affected as the ED MD's certification that the reasons and benefits for the transfer outweighed the risks of transfer did not identify the patient-specific, ""clinically specific"" risks of the transfer. 

7. During interview with the R&Q and the NM on 01/31/2019 during review of documents beginning at 1130 they confirmed that the hospital's EMTALA policies and procedures were incomplete and stated that ""draft"" policies and procedures were in progress.

Based on interview, record review, document review, and review of facility policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one (1) of twenty-one (21) patients selected for review and who had presented to the facility extension's Emergency Department (ED) seeking medical care received a medical screening examination (MSE), Patient #1.  A review of documentation in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance transport records revealed Patient #1 arrived at the facility extension ED ambulance bay on 01/12/13 at 7:58 PM and left per ambulance for the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM without disembarking from the ambulance or receiving a MSE because  facility extension ED personnel would not let Patient #1 enter the ED.

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who would investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting"", policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Review of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.

Based on interview and record review, the facility (Facility A) failed to ensure the transfer of one of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patient 1) occurred in a safe manner when Patient 1 was not provided a medical screening examination, was not determined to be in a stable condition prior to being transferred to Facility B, and was transferred via private vehicle by a family member to Facility B (25.2 miles away from Facility A). This had the potential to result in harm or death to Patient 1 and her infant.

Findings:

On November 29, 2017, the record for Patient 1 was reviewed. 

The ""Labor and Delivery Assignment Log"" dated November 8, 2017, indicated Patient 1 arrived at Facility A's L&D Unit, at 10:07 p.m., with the chief complaint of labor, at 40 weeks gestation (term pregnancy 39 to 40 weeks gestation). In addition, the Log indicated Patient 1 left Facility A, at 10:34 p.m., ""sent to (Facility B).""

The ""Face Sheet"" for Patient 1 indicated she was being seen to rule out labor.

The ""Admission"" record dated November 8, 2017, indicated Patient 1 presented to L&D, at 10:08 p.m., with the chief complaint of labor, was being seen as an outpatient, was assigned to a triage bed, was discharged    at 10:34 p.m., the discharge provider was Physician 2, and the patient's disposition was ""HOME - Discharge to Home or Self Care (Routine Discharge).""

There was no documented indication Patient 1 had consented to the transfer.

There was no documented indication the Physician had signed a certification that the medical benefits to the transfer out weighted the risks of being transferred.

There was no documented indication Facility B had accepted Patient 1 as a transfer.

There was no documented indication a provider at Facility B had accepted Patient 1.

There was no documented indication the transfer was effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment.

There was no documented indication Patient 1 was transferred to Facility B in a safe manner.

Patient 1 presented to Facility B, on November 8, 2017, at 11:04 p.m., with the chief complaint of uterine contractions at 40 weeks gestation. 

The documentation flow sheet dated November 8, 2017, at 11:14 p.m., indicated Patient 1 was dilated to 6.5 (the cervix opens, on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being completely dilated) centimeters (cm); 100% effaced (the stretching and thinning of the cervix, on a scale of 0 to 100%); and 0 station (used to describe the position of the baby's head in the pelvis area. 0 station is when the baby has dropped into the pelvis and the head is resting right at the level of the ischial spines. The ischial spines refers to the parts of the mother's pelvic girdle that protrudes inward toward the birth canal). 

The documentation flow sheet dated November 8, 2017, at 11:30 p.m., indicated Patient 1 was having uterine contractions every two to three minutes, and each contraction was lasting 60 to 100 seconds. At 11:59 p.m., Patient 1 was dilated to 8 cm.

Patient 1 delivered vaginally a baby girl on November 9, 2017, at 12:37 a.m. (1 hour and 33 minutes after arrival to Facility B).

During an interview with the House Supervisor (ACM 2), on November 29, 2017, at 2:25 p.m., the ACM 2 stated she was the House Supervisor on the evening of November 8, 2017. The ACM 2 stated before the evening of November 8, 2017, she had heard the words ""EMTALA"" but did not know what they meant, and had not had any ""EMTALA"" training at the facility. 

The ACM 2 further stated on November 8, 2017, at 10:15 p.m., she was called by the L&D Charge RN (CRN 1) who stated to her the L&D Unit had no physical beds available, and there were two patients (including Patient 1) in the waiting room waiting for evaluation for labor. The ACM 2 stated when she arrived on the L&D Unit, the CRN 1 stated L & D had no beds, there were two patients in the waiting room who had not been assessed, and CRN 1 did not know what to do. When asked if there was other space available which could be used to assess a laboring patient, the ACM 2 stated there were two gurneys in the recovery room, three OR/Delivery Rooms, and she was uncertain if there were any postpartum rooms available at that time. The ACM 2 stated she asked US 1 to call Facility B to see if they had any beds available. The ACM 2 stated she spoke with both patients (including Patient 1), and their significant others, and told them they were uncertain as to how long before a L&D bed would become available, it was ""necessary to send (the patients) to Facility B,"" and she apologized for the inconvenience. The ACM 2 stated both patients left the L&D Unit.

In addition, the ACM 2 stated she called Facility B on November 9, 2017, at 12:15 p.m., to check on Patient 1, and when she spoke with Physician 1, that was when she had an ""ah ha moment."" The ACM 2 stated the patient should never have left the facility without a medical screening examination, and if a patient was transferred to another facility, the facility policy and procedure on transfers should be followed to ensure a safe transfer.

During an interview with the Manager Labor & Delivery (MLD), on November 30, 2017, at 10:05 a.m., she reviewed the record for Patient 1, and was unable to find documentation of a medical screening examination; stabilizing treatment; and an appropriate transfer to Facility B which included consent, physician certification, acceptance by the receiving facility, acceptance by the receiving physician, and the transfer was effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment. The MLD stated Patient 1 should have been seen by a provider, and if deemed stable for transfer, should have been consented to the transfer, physician certification should have been provided, the acceptance of the receiving facility and receiving physician should have been documented, and Patient 1 should have been transferred to Facility B through qualified personnel and transportation equipment.

Based on interview and record review, Facility A failed to implement it's Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) policy and procedure (P&P), by not ensuring an appropriate medical screening examination and necessary stabilizing treatment was performed on one of 28 sampled patients, (Patient 1). Patient 1 presented to the facility with an emergency medical condition, twin pregnancy, pain, and a history of vaginal bleeding. This failure had the potential to severely impact the health and welfare of Patient 1 and her twin fetuses.

Findings:

An investigation, interviews, and record reviews were conducted on August 17, 2015, at 8:45 a.m., as a result of a complaint which alleged that, on July 14, 2015, at approximately 9 p.m., Patient 1 presented to Facility A (which had a labor and delivery department), with diagnoses of twin pregnancy (30 week gestation), pain, and a history of vaginal bleeding. 

There was no patient information pertaining to Patient 1's medical history and associated diagnoses, or assessments documented by Labor and Delivery Registered Nurse (LDRN) 1 who met with Patient 1. 

There was no documented evidence to indicate Patient 1 was registered on Facility A's Emergency Department (ED) or obstetric (OB) logs, nor was there documentation indicating Patient 1 received a medical screening examination to rule out if an emergency medical condition existed or that the patient was medically stabilized. 

An interview with the Patient Access Representative (PAR) was conducted on August 17, 2015, at 9:20 a.m. She stated Patient 1 presented on   July 14, 2015, with a history of twin pregnancy, pain, and a  history of vaginal bleeding. The PAR stated she asked Patient 1 if she was over 20 weeks gestation and she was told yes. The PAR stated she called LDRN 1 who was responsible for triaging pregnant emergency room    (ER) patients that were over 20 weeks of gestation. 

The PAR stated she went to the OB department and told LDRN 1 she had a patient in the facility's ED lobby because LDRN 1 did not answer the phone. She stated LDRN 1 came to the hospital lobby and spoke to Patient 1 and ""eyeballed"" the patient.  The PAR further stated LDRN 1 told her to call 911. LDRN 1 asked Patient 1's companion if he could take the patient to another facility as, ""They were unable to care for her at the facility (which had a labor and delivery department)."" The PAR stated this seemed ""odd"" to her and she subsequently called the Facility's RN Supervisor to inform her of the situation. 

A review of the patient census for July 14, 2015, indicated there were no patients in the labor and delivery area at the time Patient 1 arrived at Facility A. LDRN 1 was not available for interview. 

The PAR further stated Facility A's Administrator was notified that Patient 1 was going to be sent via to Hospital B via 911 and that the Administrator stated, ""I am aware."" The PAR acknowledged she should have registered the patient on Facility A's ED log as per the facility's policy, but she did not register Patient 1 on the log. 

On a Fire Department Emergency Medical Services Report, dated July 14, 2015, Patient 1 was described as ""pregnant"" with a history of pain and bleeding who was transported via 911 ambulance from Facility A's lobby to Facility B's ED. There was no evidence that transfer documentation for Patient 1 was sent with the emergency personal when the patient was transferred from Hospital A to the receiving facility (Facility B).

A review of Facility A's P&P titled, ""Medical Screening Examination, transfer and/or Referral to outside facility,"" dated January 2000, indicated, ""It is the policy of this hospital to provide a medical screening examination by a qualified person to any individual who comes to the Emergency Department (ED) seeking an examination or medical treatment (whether or not eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) and determine if the individual has an emergency medical condition; and, if it is determined that the individual has an emergency medical condition, to provide the individual with such further medical examination and treatment as required to stabilize the medical condition, within the capabilities of the hospital or to arrange for transfer of the individual to another medical facility.""

The policy further specified, ""The triage (obstetric/labor and delivery) nurse will assess and process maternity patients who come to the hospital requesting examination and treatment as follows: all women who are pregnant with a gestational age of twenty (20) weeks and beyond, who present to the ED (emergency department) with signs or symptoms which appear to be related to the pregnancy, will be transported to the labor and delivery (L&D) department and will receive a medical screening examination by and LDRN.""  

The policy further specified, ""The medical screening examination performed in the L&D department will be documented on the Observation Record and include at a minimum: date, time, chief complaint, age, sex, duration of onset of chief complaint, vital signs, level of distress, allergies, current medications, tetanus status, localized examination, onset of contractions, blood type, RH status,  Last Menstrual Period, estimated date of confinement, gravida/para (pregnancy/births), conditions of membrane and a minimum of 20 minute External Fetal Monitoring strip.""

A review of Facility A's, ""Emergency Services Rules and Regulations (Approved 12/18/14)"" specified, ""Transfer of a patient to another facility, because this facility is not able to manage the patient's specific medical problem or does not have the capacity to accept the patient, will be arranged only after adequate appraisal and initial emergency treatment has been rendered. No patients will be arbitrarily transferred to another facility, if the means of providing adequate care are available.""

An interview with the Physician (MD) 1 was conducted on August 18, at 9:30 a.m. MD 1 stated he was the OB physician on call July 14, 2015, and was called on July 14, 2015, at about 9:30 p.m., by LDRN 1 to inform him Patient 1 presented to the facility with a history of greater than 20 weeks gestation with a twin pregnancy. 

MD 1 further stated LDRN 1 told him the patient was going to be transferred to a higher level of care via 911. He stated he thought it was strange that LDRN 1 was calling him since he assumed the patient had already been assessed and examined by the ED physician and that the proper transfer paperwork had been completed by the ED physician. MD 1 acknowledged he did not clarify with LDRN 1 whether Patient 1 was examined prior to transfer. He said he told LDRN 1 he agreed Patient 1 should be transferred to a higher level of care and ended the phone call. 

An interview with MD 2 was conducted on August 18, 2015, at 10:20 a.m. MD 2 stated he was the ED physician at the facility the night Patient 1 presented to the facility. He stated he is the only physician on site during the evening hours and he was seeing a patient on the medical surgical unit when he was paged and informed by the RN Supervisor that Patient 1 had presented to the hospital with a history of twin pregnancy and bleeding and was being transferred to another facility.

MD 2 stated by the time he arrived to the ED area the patient had already had been taken to another facility via 911 ambulance. MD 2 stated he believed all patients should been seen in the ED department first and then referred as appropriate.

There was no documented evidence that the hospital staff provided a medical screening exam for Patient 1 to determine if an emergency medical condition existed.  If that information was obtained and not documented, there was no indication that the information was used in decisions concerning the care and treatment of the patient, particularly as it pertained to providing stabilizing treatment and her transfer to a higher level of care.

The facility failed to implement its EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) policy and procedure by not ensuring a complete medical screening examination was performed. On August 17, 2015, the facility's policy entitled, ""EMTALA and Transfer of patients to another facility,"" dated August 2012, was reviewed.  Per the policy, ""A medical screening examination must be offered to any individual presenting for examination or treatment of a medical condition...A medical screening examination is the process required to reach, within reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether an emergency medical condition does or does not exist.""

She stated LDRN 1 came to the hospital lobby and spoke to Patient 1 and ""eyeballed"" the patient.  The PAR further stated LDRN 1 told her to call 911. LDRN 1 asked Patient 1's companion if he could take the patient to another facility as, ""They were unable to care for her at the facility (which had a labor and delivery department)."" The PAR stated this seemed ""odd"" to her and she subsequently called the Facility's RN Supervisor to inform her of the situation. 

A review of the patient census for July 14, 2015, indicated there were no patients in the labor and delivery area at the time Patient 1 arrived at Facility A. LDRN 1 was not available for interview. 

The PAR further stated Facility A's Administrator was notified that Patient 1 was going to be sent via to Hospital B via 911 and that the Administrator stated, ""I am aware."" The PAR acknowledged she should have registered the patient on Facility A's ED log as per the facility's policy, but she did not register Patient 1 on the log. 

On a Fire Department Emergency Medical Services Report, dated July 14, 2015, Patient 1 was described as ""pregnant"" with a history of pain and bleeding who was transported via 911 ambulance from Facility A's lobby to Facility B's ED. There was no evidence that transfer documentation for Patient 1 was sent with the emergency personal when the patient was transferred from Hospital A to the receiving facility (Facility B).

A review of Facility A's P&P titled, ""Medical Screening Examination, transfer and/or Referral to outside facility,"" dated January 2000, indicated, ""It is the policy of this hospital to provide a medical screening examination by a qualified person to any individual who comes to the Emergency Department (ED) seeking an examination or medical treatment (whether or not eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) and determine if the individual has an emergency medical condition; and, if it is determined that the individual has an emergency medical condition, to provide the individual with such further medical examination and treatment as required to stabilize the medical condition, within the capabilities of the hospital or to arrange for transfer of the individual to another medical facility.""

The policy further specified, ""The triage (obstetric/labor and delivery) nurse will assess and process maternity patients who come to the hospital requesting examination and treatment as follows: all women who are pregnant with a gestational age of twenty (20) weeks and beyond, who present to the ED (emergency department) with signs or symptoms which appear to be related to the pregnancy, will be transported to the labor and delivery (L&D) department and will receive a medical screening examination by and LDRN.""  

The policy further specified, ""The medical screening examination performed in the L&D department will be documented on the Observation Record and include at a minimum: date, time, chief complaint, age, sex, duration of onset of chief complaint, vital signs, level of distress, allergies, current medications, tetanus status, localized examination, onset of contractions, blood type, RH status,  Last Menstrual Period, estimated date of confinement, gravida/para (pregnancy/births), conditions of membrane and a minimum of 20 minute External Fetal Monitoring strip.""

A review of Facility A's, ""Emergency Services Rules and Regulations (Approved 12/18/14)"" specified, ""Transfer of a patient to another facility, because this facility is not able to manage the patient's specific medical problem or does not have the capacity to accept the patient, will be arranged only after adequate appraisal and initial emergency treatment has been rendered. No patients will be arbitrarily transferred to another facility, if the means of providing adequate care are available.""

An interview with the Physician (MD) 1 was conducted on August 18, at 9:30 a.m. MD 1 stated he was the OB physician on call July 14, 2015, and was called on July 14, 2015, at about 9:30 p.m., by LDRN 1 to inform him Patient 1 presented to the facility with a history of greater than 20 weeks gestation with a twin pregnancy. 

MD 1 further stated LDRN 1 told him the patient was going to be transferred to a higher level of care via 911. He stated he thought it was strange that LDRN 1 was calling him since he assumed the patient had already been assessed and examined by the ED physician and that the proper transfer paperwork had been completed by the ED physician. MD 1 acknowledged he did not clarify with LDRN 1 whether Patient 1 was examined prior to transfer. He said he told LDRN 1 he agreed Patient 1 should be transferred to a higher level of care and ended the phone call. 

An interview with MD 2 was conducted on August 18, 2015, at 10:20 a.m. MD 2 stated he was the ED physician at the facility the night Patient 1 presented to the facility. He stated he is the only physician on site during the evening hours and he was seeing a patient on the medical surgical unit when he was paged and informed by the RN Supervisor that Patient 1 had presented to the hospital with a history of twin pregnancy and bleeding and was being transferred to another facility.

MD 2 stated by the time he arrived to the ED area the patient had already had been taken to another facility via 911 ambulance. MD 2 stated he believed all patients should been seen in the ED department first and then referred as appropriate.

There was no documented evidence that the hospital staff provided a medical screening exam for Patient 1 to determine if an emergency medical condition existed.  If that information was obtained and not documented, there was no indication that the information was used in decisions concerning the care and treatment of the patient, particularly as it pertained to providing stabilizing treatment and her transfer to a higher level of care.

The facility failed to implement its EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) policy and procedure by not ensuring a complete medical screening examination was performed. On August 17, 2015, the facility's policy entitled, ""EMTALA and Transfer of patients to another facility,"" dated August 2012, was reviewed.  Per the policy, ""A medical screening examination must be offered to any individual presenting for examination or treatment of a medical condition...A medical screening examination is the process required to reach, within reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether an emergency medical condition does or does not exist.""

A. Based on interviews, record and policy reviews, and the Birthing Center (BC) Logs the facility failed to ensure that the log identified 271 of 271 unscheduled BC patients who presented in the last six months seeking emergency services. The facility failed to log patients over 20 weeks gestation into the ED log before sending them to the OB department for care. This had the potential to affect all patients that presented to the BC to obtain a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) and were subsequently discharged    back home. 

Findings included:

1. Record review of the facility's policy titled, ""Obstetric Patient (Unscheduled) Care,"" revised 03/29/10, showed the following direction for facility staff:
-To ensure timely medical screening exams and management of unscheduled obstetrical patients presenting to the emergency department or the birthing center.
-Patients presenting for obstetric conditions, other than scheduled procedures, will be logged in by the emergency department, or directly in the birthing center, if they present there initially.
-The patient with less than 20 weeks estimated gestation (pregnancy) would be evaluated in the emergency department.
-Patients with 20 weeks or greater estimated gestation and with obstetrical related complaints will be evaluated in the birthing center.

2. Record review of the BC's Log showed that staff documented in the log both scheduled and unscheduled patients presenting to the unit. The BC's Log did not differentiate between patients scheduled to be seen from those unscheduled patients seeking a MSE.

3. Record review of the facility's ED Log and BC Log showed that neither the information in the BC Log was included in the ED Log nor did the facility have a central log that contained information from both the ED and BC Logs.

During an interview on 10/07/14 at 9:35 AM, Staff A, Registered Nurse (RN), Assistant Administrator, Patient Care Services, stated that if an OB patient presented to the facility and is over 20 weeks gestation, they would be seen in the ED triage area and then sent to the BC.

During an interview on 10/08/14 at 4:40 PM, Staff G, RN, ED, stated that OB patients over 20 weeks gestation don't get logged into our area they get logged into OB for care.

During an interview on 10/08/14 at 2:53 PM, Staff H, RN, stated that:
-She had worked at the facility for 20 years and the BC has always had its own log book.
-The BC information is not contained within the facility's ED Log.
-All OB patients are logged into the BC Log if they are 20 or more weeks pregnant.
-Patients that are under 20 week's gestation are seen in the main ED.
-The BC and ED Logs have always been separate.

B. Based on a review of the BC's Log and staff interview, the facility failed to ensure that the BC Log contained all the elements required by the facility's Emergency Department (ED) Log for unscheduled patients and that log was incorporated into the central ED's Log. This had the potential to affect all patients that presented to the BC to obtain a Medical Screening Exam (MSE) and were subsequently discharged    back home.

1. Record review of the facility's policy titled, ""Register for Emergency Department,"" revised 03/29/10, showed the following direction for facility staff:
-The emergency department personnel shall enter each patient seeking treatment in the emergency department register. The following information will be noted:
-Time of admission and time of departure.
-Patient geographical information:
	-Name;
	-Age;
	-Sex; and
	-Address-including mailing address.
-Treatment given to patient.
-Diagnosis
-Disposition of the patient.
-Physician in attendance.
-Method of arrival to the emergency department.
-Condition on discharge.

2. Record review of the facility's Birthing Center Summary of Patient Services where staff documented both scheduled and unscheduled obstetric (OB) patient visits showed the log did not contain the following information:
-Patient geographical information: Address-including mailing address.
-Treatment given to patient. 
-Diagnosis
-Physician in attendance.
-Method of arrival to the emergency department.
-Condition on discharge.
The BC's Log did not differentiate from patients that were scheduled to be seen from those patients that were unscheduled and seeking a MSE.

Based on medical record reviews, interviews and review of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor) Policies and Procedures, Emergency Department policy and procedure, Hospital # 1 failed to arrange an appropriate transfer with qualified staff and equipment to Hospital # 2 for Patient Identifier (PI # 1), a high risk 27 week pregnant patient who presented to the emergency room    with cramping and vaginal bleeding.  As a result of this deficient practice, PI # 1 was transported via private vehicle to Hospital # 2 without being informed of the potential risks where  delivery occurred via stat C-section under general anesthesia secondary to preterm labor and bleeding.  The baby was limp and not breathing at birth and required ventilator support and transport to the Neonatal Intensive Care at Hospital # 3.


This deficient practice affected PI # 1, one of 32 sampled patients and has the potential to negatively impact all pregnant females who present to Hospital # 1 with similar obstetrical complaints.  

Finding include:  

I. Hospital # 1's ER  (emergency) Log dated 6/1217 documented:

Standard Policies & Procedures 
Department: Emergency Department
Subject: EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) [Patient Transfers]
Date (s) Revised: 06/09/2008

ER Admissions/Patient Transfers
I. Introduction
...Wiregrass Medical Center is committed to full compliance with all state and federal laws regarding transfers of patients from one medical facility to another. Transfers of patients from...and to...may implicate the provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act...the ""anti-dumping law"".

EMTALA generally requires that all hospitals with an emergency department:
Provides all patients who come to the emergency department seeking evaluation or treatment for a medical condition with an appropriate medical screening examination to determine where or not an emergency medical condition exists and, 
If such condition exists either (a) stabilize the patient or (b) appropriately transfer the patient to another hospital.

An ""emergency medical condition"" is one with symptoms severe enough such that the absence of immediate medical treatment could reasonable be expected to result in:
placing the health of the individual (or with respect to a pregnant women, the health of the unborn child) in serious jeopardy...With respect to a pregnant women who is having contractions, an emergency medical condition is one which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or transfer may pose a threat to the health of the woman or the unborn child.

An ""appropriate medical screening examination"" is one that is consistent with the medical examination which the Hospital would provide to any patient who presents with the same symptoms and clinical presentation as the patient seeking medical examination and treatment.

The term 'transfer"" refers to any movement of the patient out of the Hospital at the direction of any person employed by, or otherwise affiliated with, the hospital...The term...does not include the movement of any person (1)...declared dead, or (2) leaves the Hospital without permission.

A person is not considered ""stabilized"" until such time as, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the medical condition is likely to result from, or to occur during, a transfer, or with respect to a pregnant woman in active labor, until delivery of he infant and the placenta. However, an unstable patient cab be transferred in accordance with the ""appropriate transfer"" provisions...

II. Policies and Procedure

B. Appropriate Medical Screening Examination
All patients who come to the Emergency Department seeking examination or treatment for a medical condition will be given an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, by the Emergency Department physician on duty. The screening may not be delayed in order to inquire about...health insurance or...ability to pay. The Hospital may follow reasonable registration procedures, consistently applied to all patients, following triage by a registered nurse.

For the purpose of EMTALA, a patient has ""come to the emergency department"" if he/she is on hospital property. Hospital property refers to the entire main hospital campus, including parking lots, sidewalks, and driveways...

C. Patient Transfers
If the appropriate medical screening reveals that the patient has emergency medical condition, the patient will not be transferred or discharged    until stabilized unless:
At the patient's...specific written request after being fully informed of the Hospital;s obligations under EMTALA, and of the risks and/or benefits of transfer, or A physician signs a certification...that the medical benefits reasonably expected...outweigh any increased risks...in the case of a woman in labor, or the woman her unborn child, from the transfer...

Prior to transferring any patient...the Hospital will provide medical treatment, within its capacity, that minimizes the risks to the patient's health and, in case of a woman in labor, to the health of the unborn child. 
Also, prior to transfer, Wiregrass Medical Center will obtain from the receiving hospital's acknowledgement that the receiving hospital has available space and qualified personnel...and expressed agreement of the receiving hospital to accept the transfer and provide care to the patient. The name, title, and telephone number of the individual at the receiving hospital who accepts the transfer will be documented in the patient's medical record...Wiregrass Medical Center will send...all hospital medical records related to the medical condition...to there receiving hospital, at...the time of transfer...

Wiregrass Medical Center will take measures to affect the transfer through qualified personnel and with proper transportation equipment during the transfer.

Patients who are determined not to have an emergency medical condition will not be discharged    or transferred o (to) other medical facilities unless a physician, in conjunction with nursing personnel:
assess the individual's vital signs and discharge status as soon as practical prior to transfer or discharge;
orally provides the individual with a post transfer or discharge plan of care;
certified the individual's non-emergency status;
assesses the individual's method of transportation from the hospital in light of the individual;s medical condition);
documents fully all of the above in a medical record for the patient; and
in the case of a patient transferred to another facility, sends...all medical records...

D. Patient Consent or Refusal
Wiregrass Medical Center will have satisfied it's obligations under EMTALA, if after being fully informed of the hospital's obligations under EMTALA, and the risks associated with refusing evaluation, treatment or transfer, the patient (or someone acting on his/her behalf); 
refuses to allow the Hospital to provide an appropriate medical screening,
refuses to allow the Hospital to provide stabilizing treatment, or
refuses to allow the Hospital to transfer the patient...
The Hospital will fully disclose to the patient...its obligations under EMTALA, as well as refusing the risks for refusing examination, treatment or transfer, and will attempt to obtain any such refusal in writing.

When a patient (or someone acting on his/her behalf) requests transfer to another facility, the hospital will fully disclose to the patient...the Hospitals obligations under EMTALA, along with the risks associated with transfer, and will obtain any such in writing.

Wiregrass Medical Center has policies designed to provide reasonable assurance that a patient's refusal of treatment or his/her request for transfer is not coerced, or otherwise influenced by the Hospital...

Hospital staff will encourage any patient who believes he/she may have an medical emergency condition to remain at the Hospital for a medical screening and any necessary stabilizing treatment.

If an individual chooses to leave the Hospital prior to receiving a medical screening or stabilizing treatment, and the hospital is aware that he/she intends to leave, Hospital staff will:
Offer the individual further medical examination and treatment within the staff and facilities available at the Hospital; as may be required to identify and stabilize an emergency medical condition;
Inform the individual of the benefits of such examination and treatment and of the risks of withdrawal prior to receiving such examination; and
Take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal to such examination and treatment.

E. Record Keeping
The Hospital will maintain a log of all patients who come to the Emergency Department seeking examination or treatment of a medical condition. Including information regarding the patient's ultimate disposition-e.g......, refused treatment, admitted    , transferred, or discharged   .

Standard Policies & Procedures 
Department: Emergency Department
Subject: EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) [Patient Transfers]
Date (s) Revised: 06/09/2008

ER Admissions/Patient Transfers
I. Introduction
...Wiregrass Medical Center is committed to full compliance with all state and federal laws regarding transfers of patients from one medical facility to another. Transfers of patients from...and to...may implicate the provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act...the ""anti-dumping law"".

EMTALA generally requires that all hospitals with an emergency department:
Provides all patients who come to the emergency department seeking evaluation or treatment for a medical condition with an appropriate medical screening examination to determine where or not an emergency medical condition exists and, 
If such condition exists either (a) stabilize the patient or (b) appropriately transfer the patient to another hospital.

An ""emergency medical condition"" is one with symptoms severe enough such that the absence of immediate medical treatment could reasonable be expected to result in:
placing the health of the individual (or with respect to a pregnant women, the health of the unborn child) in serious jeopardy...With respect to a pregnant women who is having contractions, an emergency medical condition is one which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or transfer may pose a threat to the health of the woman or the unborn child.

An ""appropriate medical screening examination"" is one that is consistent with the medical examination which the Hospital would provide to any patient who presents with the same symptoms and clinical presentation as the patient seeking medical examination and treatment.

The term 'transfer"" refers to any movement of the patient out of the Hospital at the direction of any person employed by, or otherwise affiliated with, the hospital...The term...does not include the movement of any person (1)...declared dead, or (2) leaves the Hospital without permission.

A person is not considered ""stabilized"" until such time as, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the medical condition is likely to result from, or to occur during, a transfer, or with respect to a pregnant woman in active labor, until delivery of he infant and the placenta. However, an unstable patient cab be transferred in accordance with the ""appropriate transfer"" provisions...

II. Policies and Procedure

B. Appropriate Medical Screening Examination
All patients who come to the Emergency Department seeking examination or treatment for a medical condition will be given an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, by the Emergency Department physician on duty. The screening may not be delayed in order to inquire about...health insurance or...ability to pay. The Hospital may follow reasonable registration procedures, consistently applied to all patients, following triage by a registered nurse.

For the purpose of EMTALA, a patient has ""come to the emergency department"" if he/she is on hospital property. Hospital property refers to the entire main hospital campus, including parking lots, sidewalks, and driveways...

C. Patient Transfers
If the appropriate medical screening reveals that the patient has emergency medical condition, the patient will not be transferred or discharged    until stabilized unless:
At the patient's...specific written request after being fully informed of the Hospital;s obligations under EMTALA, and of the risks and/or benefits of transfer, or A physician signs a certification...that the medical benefits reasonably expected...outweigh any increased risks...in the case of a woman in labor, or the woman her unborn child, from the transfer...

Prior to transferring any patient...the Hospital will provide medical treatment, within its capacity, that minimizes the risks to the patient's health and, in case of a woman in labor, to the health of the unborn child. 
Also, prior to transfer, Wiregrass Medical Center will obtain from the receiving hospital's acknowledgement that the receiving hospital has available space and qualified personnel...and expressed agreement of the receiving hospital to accept the transfer and provide care to the patient. The name, title, and telephone number of the individual at the receiving hospital who accepts the transfer will be documented in the patient's medical record...Wiregrass Medical Center will send...all hospital medical records related to the medical condition...to there receiving hospital, at...the time of transfer...

Wiregrass Medical Center will take measures to affect the transfer through qualified personnel and with proper transportation equipment during the transfer.

Patients who are determined not to have an emergency medical condition will not be discharged    or transferred o (to) other medical facilities unless a physician, in conjunction with nursing personnel:
assess the individual's vital signs and discharge status as soon as practical prior to transfer or discharge;
orally provides the individual with a post transfer or discharge plan of care;
certified the individual's non-emergency status;
assesses the individual's method of transportation from the hospital in light of the individual;s medical condition);
documents fully all of the above in a medical record for the patient; and
in the case of a patient transferred to another facility, sends...all medical records...

D. Patient Consent or Refusal
Wiregrass Medical Center will have satisfied it's obligations under EMTALA, if after being fully informed of the hospital's obligations under EMTALA, and the risks associated with refusing evaluation, treatment or transfer, the patient (or someone acting on his/her behalf); 
refuses to allow the Hospital to provide an appropriate medical screening,
refuses to allow the Hospital to provide stabilizing treatment, or
refuses to allow the Hospital to transfer the patient...
The Hospital will fully disclose to the patient...its obligations under EMTALA, as well as refusing the risks for refusing examination, treatment or transfer, and will attempt to obtain any such refusal in writing.

When a patient (or someone acting on his/her behalf) requests transfer to another facility, the hospital will fully disclose to the patient...the Hospitals obligations under EMTALA, along with the risks associated with transfer, and will obtain any such in writing.

Wiregrass Medical Center has policies designed to provide reasonable assurance that a patient's refusal of treatment or his/her request for transfer is not coerced, or otherwise influenced by the Hospital...

Hospital staff will encourage any patient who believes he/she may have an medical emergency condition to remain at the Hospital for a medical screening and any necessary stabilizing treatment.

If an individual chooses to leave the Hospital prior to receiving a medical screening or stabilizing treatment, and the hospital is aware that he/she intends to leave, Hospital staff will:
Offer the individual further medical examination and treatment within the staff and facilities available at the Hospital; as may be required to identify and stabilize an emergency medical condition;
Inform the individual of the benefits of such examination and treatment and of the risks of withdrawal prior to receiving such examination; and
Take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal to such examination and treatment.

E. Record Keeping
The Hospital will maintain a log of all patients who come to the Emergency Department seeking examination or treatment of a medical condition. Including information regarding the patient's ultimate disposition-e.g......, refused treatment, admitted    , transferred, or discharged   .

Based on observation, interviews and record reviews, the hospital's Governing Board failed to:

1) Ensure all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) and L&D (Labor and Delivery) from 01/01/11 to 06/29/11 received an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) existed, stabilizing treatment was provided and appropriate transfers were initiated if needed.   Patient #2 presented to the ED for a potential EMC did not receive an appropriate MSE to determine if stabilizing treatment was needed prior to transferring the patient to L&D without appropriate qualified medical personnel.

The Registered Nurses (RNs) and Medical Residents who performed the MSE in the ED and L&D were not appointed by the Governing Body as Qualified Medical Practitioners (QMP) to provide MSE. 

2) Adopt and enforce a hospital policy to ensure EMTALA requirements are met in order to provide for all individuals presenting to the ED and L&D for examination of a medical condition an appropriate MSE by a QMP to determine whether or not an EMC exists, provide stabilizing treatment and/or effect an appropriate transfer. 

It is determined this deficient practice creates an Immediate Jeopardy situation and places the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy. 

Findings Included: 

During a tour of the facility at 3:30 P.M. on 06/29/11, the surveyor accompanied by the CNO (Personnel #1) and the ED Nurse Manager (Personnel #2) observed the ED Volunteer (Personnel #53) escorting a pregnant patient (Patient #2) and her husband down the hall. The pregnant patient was holding her stomach and appeared to be in distress. The Volunteer (Personnel #53) stopped at the end of the hall and gave directions to Patient #2 and her husband to the L&D Unit. The Volunteer (Personnel #53) then left Patient #2 and her husband alone to find the L&D area unaccompanied. The CNO (Personnel #1) and the ED Nurse Manager (Personnel #2) verified the escort is a volunteer and not a qualified medical person. 

The surveyor, CNO (Personnel #1) and the ED Nurse Manager (Personnel #2) then followed Patient #2 and her husband down the hall to the elevator. The CNO intervened at this point and asked the patient if she needed help. Patient #2 stated she is having contractions and is going to the L&D area. The CNO, ED Manager and the surveyor accompanied Patient #2 in the elevator to the 3rd floor where the L&D is located. The CNO asked the registration clerk to open the door to allow the patient in. The CNO handed the patient off to the L&D Nurses and gave them report. Patient #2 was then placed at the Registration desk inside the L&D area. The surveyor observed the Registration Clerk taking Patient #2's personal information including asking her for a copy of her Identification and Insurance or Medicaid paperwork prior to a medical screening examination (MSE) being performed to determine if an emergency medical condition (EMC) existed. 

The surveyor asked Patient #2 if she was checked into the ED and examined first before being sent to L&D. She stated, ""No. The person at the desk told the Volunteer to take me to the Labor and Delivery area."" 

RN #4 escorted Patient #2 to the patient care area to be assessed. RN #4 was asked if she does the medical screening for the L&D patients. She stated, ""Yes. The nurses do it if the patient's have a private physician. They will ask us to check the patient and call them back with what the exam looked like. We let them know and if everything is ok then we discharge them home. If the patient is without a physician, we call the resident to examine them and they are listed under MD #54. He is the attending over the resident program.""

The surveyor then interviewed the L&D Charge Nurse (RN #33). She was asked if the resident or physician performs the medical screening for patient's that present to the L&D. She stated, ""No. The RN's do the medical screening."" She was asked what the responsibilities of the Triage Nurse are. She stated, ""The triage nurse gets the patient's to sign the consents, fills out the doctor's order sheet, performs maternal vital signs (VS), monitors the fetal heart rate (HR), uterine contractions, pain and medical history.""  She was asked if the attending physician comes in to see the patient when he is notified one of his or her patient's have presented to L&D. She stated, ""No. Not all the time. They have privileges to see the fetal strip on a computer.""  She was asked if the residents perform care on the patients. She stated, ""Yes, with help of the attending.""

Review of the ED or OB/GYN Nursing Staff files did not contain letters of recommendation from the Medical Staff or letters of appointment from the Governing Board determining any nurses as QMP's to perform MSE's to determine if an EMC exists for patient's that present to the hospital for emergencies.

The ED or OB/GYN Nursing Staff files did not contain specific QMP competencies or evaluations to perform MSE's for EMC's.

At 4:00 P.M. on 06/29/11 the surveyor interviewed Personnel #2, the ED Nurse Manager. She was asked if the nurses perform MSE's in the ED. She stated, ""No. The nurses perform triage and the physician's do the medical screening.""  She was asked if the nurses make the determination when the patient's are taken back to the main ED or Fast Track to see a physician. She stated, ""Yes. We use the 5 level triage system.

At 4:00 P.M. on 06/29/11 the surveyor interviewed Personnel #2, the ED Nurse Manager. She was asked if the nurses perform MSE's in the ED. She stated, ""No. The nurses perform triage and the physician's do the medical screening.""  She was asked if the nurses make the determination when the patient's are taken back to the main ED or Fast Track to see a physician. She stated, ""Yes. We use the 5 level triage system. We make the determination based on the triage system who is seen first by the physician."" She was asked if the Paramedic checking in the patient's performs triage. She stated, ""The paramedic does a quick check based on their complaint and makes the determination which patient needs to see the nurse first."" She was asked if it is the ED policy to send patient's to L&D without medical screening. She stated, ""We send all of our patient's that are greater than 20 weeks pregnant to L&D for screening unless they are trauma patients.""

Based on review of medical records, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policies and procedures, and staff interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening exam was provided for one (1) of 20 sampled medical records (#1). Specifically, the facility failed to provide a medical screening exam for Patient #1 when the 29 week gestation pregnant patient presented to the Labor and Delivery Unit with an emergent medical condition.

Findings were: 

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) medical record of Patient #1 revealed that the patient walked into the ED and (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1:31 p.m.  Documentation by Greeter BB at 1:59 p.m. revealed that the patient came in with a chief complaint of a headache and denied any pregnancy complaints. The same notation revealed that the patient became angry and at 1:46 p.m. Patient # 1 left the facility.  The note revealed that the patient was angry because she was not going directly to Labor and Delivery (L&D).  The greeter documented that when it was explained to the patient that she would see the ED Doctor first, she became angry and left the facility. Further review revealed that Nurse Coordinator NN charted in the medical record at 4:57 p.m. that the patient had left the facility at 1:35 p.m. prior to triage.

There was no information available on Patient # 1 from her exit of the ED at 1:46 p.m. until the following medical record from Obstetrical (related to childbirth and the processes involved with it) Emergency Department (OBED).

Review of (L&D) medical record revealed Patient #1 arrived at 3:42 p.m. to the OBED (Obstetrical Emergency Department) on second floor of the facility. Registered Nurse (RN) MM documented she was a walk-in patient from home. Patient #1 reported that her reason for visit was headache, seeing spots, nausea and vomiting that morning, dizziness and mild cramping. The record revealed the patient has had some high blood pressure this pregnancy and is currently taking Labetalol (a medication used to treat high blood pressure).  The patient ' s Obstetrician (doctor who specializes in the care of pregnant women and their unborn baby) was documented as her primary Dr. KK.  The clinic summary revealed her estimated date of confinement (due date) was 4/22/19 and that she was at 29.5 weeks gestation (period of development, normal gestation or length of pregnancy is 40 weeks). Initial Vital Signs were documented at 3:59 p.m. as Pulse(P)-109 (normal Pulse 60-100 in adults) and Blood Pressure (BP)-138/87 (normal blood pressure in adults 120/80-140/90).  Registered Nurse MM ' s assessment of Patient #1 at 3:59 p.m. revealed Patient #1 had swelling in both lower extremities (legs and feet), headache for several hours, and she was not currently in active labor.    
Vital signs at 4:04 p.m. were P-103 and BP-151/94
Vital signs at 4:09 p.m. were P-103 and BP-156/104
Vital signs at 4:14 p.m. were P-100 and BP 153/84
Vital signs at 4:19 p.m. were P-102 and BP 155/83
Fetal Heart Monitoring revealed the fetal heart rate (rate at which the unborn baby ' s heart beats) baseline was 150 beats per minute (bpm).  Normal fetal heart rate is between 120-160 bpm.
Further review of the medical record revealed at 4:29 p.m. that RN MM notified Dr. KK that his patient who was pregnant with her first child and at the time 29.5 weeks gestation was in L&D at the facility. The record reveals that Dr KK was told that Patient #1 had been seen in his office for symptoms of preeclampsia (preeclampsia is a condition that pregnant women develop that is marked by high blood pressure, elevated levels of protein in the urine, and often swelling in the feet, legs, and hands). Dr. KK was informed that the patient was taking Labetalol 100 milligrams twice a day. RN MM noted that she reported to Dr. KK that the triage assessment revealed Patient #1 ' s headache was rated 10 on a pain scale where 1 is mild and 10 is the most severe and was unrelieved by Tylenol, that she had been seeing spots before her eyes, dizziness, nausea and vomiting during the morning, and swelling and soreness in her lower extremities.  RN MM report further revealed the blood pressure readings ranging from 130s/80s to 150s/100s were discussed.  RN MM notified Dr. KK that the patient was due for her Labetalol at that time.  Fetal monitor tracing was reviewed with Dr. KK.  Dr. KK gave a phone order to discharge the patient with instructions not to go home but to report to another facility in town where he would see Patient #1. Patient #1 was discharged    at 4:26 p.m. with instructions to go directly to the other acute care hospital per her own obstetrician ' s directions.  Patient #1 left with her significant other in a personal vehicle.  There was no record of the on-call OB physician being called. 

At the time of the survey no records were available from the receiving facility.

Review of the Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the facility, approved by the Medical Executive Committee 3/11/14, The General medical Staff 4/4/14, and the Board of Trustees 4/22/14, revealed the following:
ARTICLE X - Emergency Services
10.1. General:
Emergency services and care will be provided to any person in danger of loss of life or serious injury or illness whenever there are appropriate facilities and qualified personnel available to provide such services or care. Such emergency services and care will be provided without regard to the patient's race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, sex, pre-existing medical condition, physical or mental handicap, insurance status, economic status, sexual orientation or ability to pay for medical services, except to the extent such circumstance is medically significant to the provision of appropriate care to the patient.
10.2. Medical Screening Examinations:
Medical screening examinations, within the capability of the Hospital, will be performed on all individuals who come to the Hospital requesting examination or treatment to determine the presence of an emergency medical condition. Qualified Medical personnel who can perform medical screening examinations within applicable Hospital policies and procedures are defined as:
(a)  Emergency Department:
(1)  members of the Medical Staff with clinical privileges in Emergency Medicine;
(2)  other Active Staff members; and
(3)  appropriately credentialed allied health professionals.
(b)  Labor and Delivery:
(1)  members of the Medical Staff with OB/GYN (gynecology - practitioner who specializes in the care/treatment of female reproductive organs) privileges;
(2)  Certified Nurse Midwives with 0B privileges; and
(3)  Registered Nurses who have achieved competency in Labor and Delivery and who have validated skills to provide fetal monitoring and labor assessment.
10.3. On-Call Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of the scheduled on-call physician to respond to calls from the Emergency Department in accordance with Hospital policies and procedures.

Review of the facility ' s policies included but were not limited to the following

I - OB Patients in The Emergency Department, Policy Number  33, last reviewed: 4/2016 revealed that the hospital provides available, appropriate emergency services to a woman who seeks hospital care for the safe delivery of her child.
GUIDELINES:
1. The evaluation and emergency medical care of any obstetrical patient presenting to the Emergency Department shall comply with the Georgia Emergency Medical Services to pregnant Women Act of 1984 and the Federal COBRA Act of 1986 and EMTALA (Emergency Medical and Labor Act) and they will be registered on the EMTALA log.
2. A gravid (pregnant) patient greater than 20 weeks, the Women's  Center charge nurse should be notified and will respond promptly to assess the patient.

II - Policy EMTALA- Medical Screening Examination and Stabilization Policy, Policy Number  08, last revised 05/2017, revealed the purpose was to establish guidelines for providing appropriate medical screening exam (MSE) and any necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer for the individual as required by EMTALA.
An EMTALA obligation is triggered when an individual comes to a dedicated emergency department (DED) and:
1. the individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an examination or treatment for a medical condition; or 
2. a prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.  Such obligation is further extended to those individuals presenting elsewhere on hospital property requesting examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC). Further, if a prudent layperson observer would believe that the individual is experiencing an EMC, then an appropriate MSE, within the capabilities of the hospital's DED (including ancillary services routinely available and the availability of on-call physicians), shall be performed. The MSE must be completed by an individual (i) qualified to perform such an examination to determine whether an EMC exists, or (ii) with respect to a pregnant woman having contractions, whether the woman is in labor and whether the treatment requested is explicitly for an EMC. If an EMC is determined to exist, the individual will be provided necessary stabilizing treatment, within the capacity and capability of the facility, or an appropriate transfer as defined by and required by EMTALA. Stabilization treatment shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (e.g., no different level of care because of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law).
Procedure:
1. When an MSE is Required 
A hospital must provide an appropriate MSE within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the DED, to determine whether or not an EMC exists: (i) to any individual, including a pregnant woman having contractions, who requests such an examination; (ii) an individual who has such a request made on his or her behalf; or (iii) an individual whom a prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior needs an MSE. An MSE shall be provided to determine whether the individual is experiencing an EMC or a pregnant woman is in labor. An MSE is required when:
a. The individual comes to a DED of a hospital and a request is made by the individual or on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, including where: 
i. The individual requests medication to resolve or provide stabilizing treatment for a medical condition. 
The MSE of the individual must be documented. This type of screening cannot be performed by the triage nurse. If an EMC is determined to exist and the hospital admits the individual as an inpatient for further treatment, the hospital's obligation under EMTALA ceases. 
Note: The MSE and other emergency services need not be provided in a location specifically identified as a DED. The hospital may use areas to deliver emergency services that are also used for other inpatient or outpatient services. MSEs or stabilization may require ancillary services available only in areas or facilities of the hospital outside of the DED.
b. The individual arrives on the hospital property other than a DED and makes a request or another makes a request on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for an EMC.
i. Screening where the individual presented: If an individual is initially screened in a department or location on-campus other than the DED, the individual may be moved to another hospital department or facility on-campus to receive further screening or stabilizing treatment without such movement being a transfer. The hospital shall not move the individual to an off-campus facility or department (such as an urgent care center or satellite clinic) for an MSE. 
3.  Extent of the MSE
 a. Determine if an EMC exists. The hospital must perform an MSE to determine if an EMC exists. It is not appropriate to merely 
""log in"" or triage an individual with a medical condition and not provide an MSE. Triage is not equivalent to an MSE. Triage entails the clinical assessment of the individual's presenting signs and symptoms at the time of arrival at the hospital in order to prioritize when the individual will be screened by a physician or other QMP.
 b. Definition of MSE. An MSE is the process required to reach, with reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether the individual has an EMC or not. It is not an isolated event. The MSE must be appropriate to the individual's presenting signs and symptoms and the capability and capacity of the hospital.
 c. An on-going process. The individual shall be continuously monitored according to the individual's needs until it is determined whether or not the individual has an EMC, and if he or she does, until he or she is stabilized or appropriately admitted     or transferred. The medical record shall reflect the amount and extent of monitoring that was provided prior to the completion of the MSE and until discharge or transfer.
 d. Judgment of physician or QMP. The extent of the necessary examination to determine whether an EMC exists is generally within the judgment and discretion of the physician or other QMP performing the examination function according to algorithms or protocols established and approved by the medical staff and governing board.
 e. Extent of MSE varies by presenting symptoms. The MSE may vary depending on the individual's signs and symptoms: 
i. Depending on the individual's presenting symptoms, an appropriate MSE can involve a wide spectrum of actions, ranging from a simple process involving only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that also involves performing ancillary studies and procedures such as (but not limited to) lumbar punctures, clinical laboratory tests, CT scans and other diagnostic tests and procedures. 
ii. Pregnant Women: The medical records should show evidence that the screening examination includes, at a minimum, on-going evaluation of fetal heart tones, regularity and duration of uterine contractions, fetal position and station, cervical dilation, and status of membranes (i.e., ruptured, leaking and intact), to document whether or not the woman is in labor. A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a physician, certified nurse-midwife or other QMP acting within his or her scope of practice as defined by the hospital's medical staff bylaws and State medical practice acts, certifies in writing that after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor. The recommended timeframe for such physician certification of the QMP's determination of false labor should be within 24 hours of the MSE, however, the medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations can provide guidance on the timeframe. 
4. Who May Perform the MSE
a. Only the following individuals may perform an MSE: 
i. A qualified physician with appropriate privileges; 
ii. Other qualified licensed independent practitioner (LIP) with appropriate competencies and privileges; or 
iii. A qualified staff member who: 
--is qualified to conduct such an examination through appropriate privileging and demonstrated competencies; 
--is functioning within the scope of his or her license and in compliance with state law and applicable practice acts (e.g., Medical or Nurse Practice Acts); 
-- is performing the screening examination based on medical staff approved guidelines, protocols or algorithms; and 
-- is approved by the facility's governing board as set forth in a document such as the hospital bylaws or medical staff rules and regulations, which document has been approved by the facility's governing body and medical staff. It is not acceptable for the facility to allow informal personnel appointments that could change frequently. 
b. Qualified Medical Personnel. QMPs may perform an MSE if licensed and certified, approved by the hospital's governing board through the hospital's by-laws, and only if the scope of the EMC is within the individual's scope of practice. 
i. The designation of QMP is set forth in a document approved by the governing body of the hospital. Each individual QMP approved to provide an MSE under EMTALA must be appropriately credentialed and must meet the requirements for annual evaluations set forth in the protocol agreements with physicians and the State's medical practice act, nurse practice act or other similar practice acts established to govern health care practitioners. Only appropriately credentialed Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN)s, Physician Assistants (PA)s and physicians may perform MSEs in the DED. 
iii. Labor and Delivery QMP. QMPs in the labor and delivery DED may be appropriately-approved RNs and must communicate their findings as to whether or not a woman is in labor to the obstetrician on call, the laborist, or the ED physician. 
iv. Limitations. The hospital has established a process to ensure that: 
--a physician examines all individuals whose conditions or symptoms require physician examination; 
--an ED physician on duty is responsible for the general care of all individuals presenting themselves to the emergency department; and 
--the responsibility remains with the ED physician until the individual's private physician or an on-call specialist assumes that responsibility, or the individual is discharged   . 

III - Women's '  Center Policy Policy Medical Screening Exam, Policy # 21, last revised 03/2019 revealed the purpose to provide guidelines to insure a MSE is performed by QMP on patients presenting to the OB department requesting treatment.
PURPOSE:
To provide a Medical Screening Examination to any patient presenting to the L&D by qualified nursing personnel utilizing the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tab in the electronic medical record.
1. Notify the physician of patient arrival and obtain orders to assess the patient using the Medical Screening Tool found in Centricity Perinatal (CPN) medical record. Physician notification should be made within 30 minutes of the patient's arrival to the department. If the patient is not an established patient with an obstetrician at Doctors Hospital, she must be assigned to the obstetrician on call. The OB on-call list is available in Labor and Delivery, as well as the E.D. 
2. Patients > 20 weeks pregnant may be evaluated in either the ED or L&D depending on the patient's presenting symptoms, unless the patient is unstable. Unstable patients will be evaluated and treated in the ED and stabilized prior to being transferred to L&D. The L&D RN will assist the ED staff as requested.
4. If the patient is discharged   , complete another MSE with update of status of discharge disposition. The physician must certify the orders within 24 hours if ""Read back and verified"" is not documented, otherwise the orders may be verified within 30 days of patient discharge. 
5. In the event of an emergency transfer to a higher level of care, and the physician is not physically present at the time of transfer, the QMP can sign the certification as long as the QMP is in consultation with the physician. Also, the physician must be in agreement with the certification and subsequently countersigns the certification. The date and time of such certification should closely match the date and time of transfer.
1. Obtain prenatal records if available and review. Notify physician of the patient's arrival. All OBED patients must have the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tool completed in CPN medical record found under the blue Admit tab. Results of medical screening will indicate if a provider must come in to examine the patient prior to discharge. 
2. Documentation of patient assessment should be complete, thorough and recorded in the CPN electronic patient chart. 
3. All fetal monitor strips are labeled or maintained and archived in the CPN system. 
4. An initial MSE will be completed on ALL OBED patients, printed and placed on medical record...if OBED patient is stable and discharged    undelivered, a reassessment MSE will be completed, printed and also placed on medical record. Please document required disposition on blue discharge tab.

During an interview on 4/08/19 at 11:10 a.m. Paramedic/Greeter BB said when pregnant patients arrive in the ED they are asked what is going on and what is their due date. If they are greater than 20 weeks and have any pregnancy related symptoms, they are immediately sent up to L&D for further evaluation.  She expounded that pregnancy related symptoms might be nausea, vomiting, swelling, water leaking or even headache which could be a sign of preeclampsia. If symptoms are questionable for pregnancy related, the registrar is to immediately call the ED Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner to come and evaluate.  

During the tour of the L&D unit on 4/8/19 at 11:30 a.m. an interview was conducted with L&D Clinical Director (EE).  She confirmed that the facility has a Level II Neonatal (newborn)Intensive Care Unit that can care for babies born after 32 weeks gestation (developmental age of the unborn baby) without any complications.  She said the L&D Unit will transfer a mother pending delivery prior to 32 weeks gestation to the hospital of her primary Obstetrician ' s choice.  

During an interview on 4/9/19 at 9:50 a.m. in the Conference Room, Paramedic BB, confirmed that she was the ED Greeter on 2/8/19.  The Paramedic explained that on 2/8/19 Patient #1 presented to the ED and reported that she was 29 weeks pregnant, had a headache and needed to go to L&D.  The Paramedic said she asked the patient if she was having any pregnancy related issues such as:  abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, back pain or pressure, pelvic pain, nausea or vomiting, if her water had broken or if her mucus plug (protective barrier that blocks bacteria from entering the uterus).  The Paramedic said Patient #1 denied any pregnancy related symptoms and repeated that she had a headache and need to go to L&D because she was 29 weeks pregnant.  The Paramedic said Patient #1 then went to the registration desk and told the Registrar that she was 29 weeks pregnant and needed to go to L&D because she had a headache.  Paramedic BB said the Registrar tried to register the patient but the patient got angry and turned to leave the ED.  Paramedic BB reported that Patient #1 stated I can't believe you aren't sending me to L&D, I'm 29 weeks pregnant, I have a headache, swelling and my blood pressure is high, just as the patient walked out the ED door.  The Paramedic said she then documented her note in the electronic medical record. Paramedic BB said she did not try to bring the patient back into the ED because the patient was angry and there were about 14 patients at the desk.  The Paramedic confirmed that she did not think about getting the Charge Nurse to speak with the patient.  The Paramedic said she has worked in the facility's ED since August 2017 and has been a Paramedic since 2006.  Paramedic BB stated that she receives EMTALA training annually and since this episode she has completed three (3) or four (4) OB related Healthstream courses.  

During an interview on 4/9/19 at 10:35 a.m. in the Conference Room, RN MM confirmed that she was working L&D on 2/8/19 and that she remembers providing care for Patient #1.  RN MM said she has been a RN since 2014, a L&D nurse since 2015, and has been working at the facility since February 2018.  The RN said she remembers that the L&D Charge Nurse informed her that Patient #1 would be arriving and that the patient was experiencing a headache and pregnancy induced hypertension (high blood pressure).  RN MM said she was setting up the room when Patient #1 arrived and that she helped the patient put on a gown and attached the fetal monitor (evaluates the baby's heartrate).  RN MM said she asked the patient what brought her to the hospital and was informed that the patient was seen by the Dr. KK in his office and had lab work, I think that day to see if the patient was pre-eclamptic.  RN MM reviewed her notes and said the patient's symptoms included:  headache, dizziness, seeing spots, nausea, vomiting and mild cramping.  RN MM explained that the patient was not admitted     at this point and had only been triaged by RN MM.  RN MM said she completed Patient #1's assessment and was informed by the patient that she was prescribed Labetalol but that she had forgotten to take her medication that day.  RN MM said her first thought was to call Patient #1's Dr. KK to get orders.  RN MM explained that she called the Patient's doctor KK and gave him an update of the patient's condition, the patient's blood pressure reading and informed the physician that the patient had missed taking her blood pressure medication. RN MM said she asked the physician what he wanted to do and he asked her to repeat the patient's blood pressure and then gave orders for the patient to be discharged    with instructions for the patient to go directly to another local acute care hospital.  RN MM said she thought this was odd and wondered whether this should be done.  RN MM said she asked the physician KK if he wanted the patient transported (by ambulance) and the physician replied ""no, just tell the patient to come straight here and not to go anywhere else"".  RN MM said she asked the physician KK if he wanted her to give the patient the Labetatol and he replied no.  RN MM said she discussed this with the L&D Charge Nurse and the L&D Charge Nurse asked about Patient #1's blood pressure and then told RN MM that the physician ordered the patient to be discharged    so that's what we will do. RN MM added that after speaking with the patient's physician it never occurred to her that the on-call OB physician could be contacted.  RN MM said that she received EMTALA training 4/7/19 but had also had EMTALA training in the past. RN MM confirmed that EMTALA training is required annually.  RN MM explained that she has also completed the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tool Healthstream training.  

During a phone interview on 4/9/19 at 12:30 p.m. with Dr. KK he reported that he remembered Patient #1.  He confirmed he was her primary OB and had seen her earlier in the week of 2/8/19 in his office.  He stated he had not sent her to the Emergency Department for evaluation.  He reported that Patient #1 did have chronic (persisting for a long time or recurring) hypertension (high blood pressure) and had shown some protein (small molecules that play critical roles in the body) in her urine (if high amounts of protein are found in the urine late in a pregnancy, it may indicate kidney disease or preeclampsia).  Dr. KK said he had sent labs off to be tested   and sent the patient to see a urologist (physician who specializes in the treatment of the urinary tract {body 's drainage system for removing urine}) to rule out kidney (bean shaped organs that filter blood to remove wastes and make urine) damage and preeclampsia.  Dr. KK reported he was at another acute care hospital in the local area when RN MM called to tell him his patient was at their facility.  He confirmed that RN MM had provided him with her assessment of the patient and given him all the vital signs.  He said he did not think the patient was that unstable. Dr. KK said he told RN MM where he was and asked that the patient not be admitted     to her facility but be sent over to where he was for further evaluation.  He explained that the facility where he was located at that time was not far and was able to provide specialized care if there were complications with the pregnancy.  He confirmed that RN MM asked about emergency transport by ambulance, but he said he did not think Patient #1 ' s condition warranted emergency transport. He confirmed that Nurse MM asked if he wanted Patient #1 to get her Labetalol at that time and he told her no.  Dr. KK said he assumed care when Patient #1 arrived at his location.  He said he evaluated her and told her they would just watch her for a few days in the hospital.  He said she was stable at that time.  He said he left the hospital and was called back to the hospital in less than 30 minutes.  When he arrived back at the hospital he found an emergency delivery was warranted and the baby was delivered by Cesarean-Section (surgery where the baby is taken out through the mother ' s abdomen).

Based on review of medical records, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policies and procedures, and staff interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening exam was provided for one (1) of 20 sampled medical records (#1). Specifically, the facility failed to provide a medical screening exam for Patient #1 when the 29 week gestation pregnant patient presented to the Labor and Delivery Unit with an emergent medical condition.

Findings were: 

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) medical record of Patient #1 revealed that the patient walked into the ED and (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1:31 p.m.  Documentation by Greeter BB at 1:59 p.m. revealed that the patient came in with a chief complaint of a headache and denied any pregnancy complaints. The same notation revealed that the patient became angry and at 1:46 p.m. Patient # 1 left the facility.  The note revealed that the patient was angry because she was not going directly to Labor and Delivery (L&D).  The greeter documented that when it was explained to the patient that she would see the ED Doctor first, she became angry and left the facility. Further review revealed that Nurse Coordinator NN charted in the medical record at 4:57 p.m. that the patient had left the facility at 1:35 p.m. prior to triage.

There was no information available on Patient # 1 from her exit of the ED at 1:46 p.m. until the following medical record from Obstetrical (related to childbirth and the processes involved with it) Emergency Department (OBED).

Review of (L&D) medical record revealed Patient #1 arrived at 3:42 p.m. to the OBED (Obstetrical Emergency Department) on second floor of the facility. Registered Nurse (RN) MM documented she was a walk-in patient from home. Patient #1 reported that her reason for visit was headache, seeing spots, nausea and vomiting that morning, dizziness and mild cramping. The record revealed the patient has had some high blood pressure this pregnancy and is currently taking Labetalol (a medication used to treat high blood pressure).  The patient ' s Obstetrician (doctor who specializes in the care of pregnant women and their unborn baby) was documented as her primary Dr. KK.  The clinic summary revealed her estimated date of confinement (due date) was 4/22/19 and that she was at 29.5 weeks gestation (period of development, normal gestation or length of pregnancy is 40 weeks). Initial Vital Signs were documented at 3:59 p.m. as Pulse(P)-109 (normal Pulse 60-100 in adults) and Blood Pressure (BP)-138/87 (normal blood pressure in adults 120/80-140/90).  Registered Nurse MM ' s assessment of Patient #1 at 3:59 p.m. revealed Patient #1 had swelling in both lower extremities (legs and feet), headache for several hours, and she was not currently in active labor.    
Vital signs at 4:04 p.m. were P-103 and BP-151/94
Vital signs at 4:09 p.m. were P-103 and BP-156/104
Vital signs at 4:14 p.m. were P-100 and BP 153/84
Vital signs at 4:19 p.m. were P-102 and BP 155/83
Fetal Heart Monitoring revealed the fetal heart rate (rate at which the unborn baby ' s heart beats) baseline was 150 beats per minute (bpm).  Normal fetal heart rate is between 120-160 bpm.
Further review of the medical record revealed at 4:29 p.m. that RN MM notified Dr. KK that his patient who was pregnant with her first child and at the time 29.5 weeks gestation was in L&D at the facility. The record reveals that Dr KK was told that Patient #1 had been seen in his office for symptoms of preeclampsia (preeclampsia is a condition that pregnant women develop that is marked by high blood pressure, elevated levels of protein in the urine, and often swelling in the feet, legs, and hands). Dr. KK was informed that the patient was taking Labetalol 100 milligrams twice a day. RN MM noted that she reported to Dr. KK that the triage assessment revealed Patient #1 ' s headache was rated 10 on a pain scale where 1 is mild and 10 is the most severe and was unrelieved by Tylenol, that she had been seeing spots before her eyes, dizziness, nausea and vomiting during the morning, and swelling and soreness in her lower extremities.  RN MM report further revealed the blood pressure readings ranging from 130s/80s to 150s/100s were discussed.  RN MM notified Dr. KK that the patient was due for her Labetalol at that time.  Fetal monitor tracing was reviewed with Dr. KK.  Dr. KK gave a phone order to discharge the patient with instructions not to go home but to report to another facility in town where he would see Patient #1. Patient #1 was discharged    at 4:26 p.m. with instructions to go directly to the other acute care hospital per her own obstetrician ' s directions.  Patient #1 left with her significant other in a personal vehicle.  There was no record of the on-call OB physician being called. 

At the time of the survey no records were available from the receiving facility.

Review of the Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the facility, approved by the Medical Executive Committee 3/11/14, The General medical Staff 4/4/14, and the Board of Trustees 4/22/14, revealed the following:
ARTICLE X - Emergency Services
10.1. General:
Emergency services and care will be provided to any person in danger of loss of life or serious injury or illness whenever there are appropriate facilities and qualified personnel available to provide such services or care. Such emergency services and care will be provided without regard to the patient's race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, sex, pre-existing medical condition, physical or mental handicap, insurance status, economic status, sexual orientation or ability to pay for medical services, except to the extent such circumstance is medically significant to the provision of appropriate care to the patient.
10.2. Medical Screening Examinations:
Medical screening examinations, within the capability of the Hospital, will be performed on all individuals who come to the Hospital requesting examination or treatment to determine the presence of an emergency medical condition. Qualified Medical personnel who can perform medical screening examinations within applicable Hospital policies and procedures are defined as:
(a)  Emergency Department:
(1)  members of the Medical Staff with clinical privileges in Emergency Medicine;
(2)  other Active Staff members; and
(3)  appropriately credentialed allied health professionals.
(b)  Labor and Delivery:
(1)  members of the Medical Staff with OB/GYN (gynecology - practitioner who specializes in the care/treatment of female reproductive organs) privileges;
(2)  Certified Nurse Midwives with 0B privileges; and
(3)  Registered Nurses who have achieved competency in Labor and Delivery and who have validated skills to provide fetal monitoring and labor assessment.
10.3. On-Call Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of the scheduled on-call physician to respond to calls from the Emergency Department in accordance with Hospital policies and procedures.

Review of the facility ' s policies included but were not limited to the following

I - OB Patients in The Emergency Department, Policy Number  33, last reviewed: 4/2016 revealed that the hospital provides available, appropriate emergency services to a woman who seeks hospital care for the safe delivery of her child.
GUIDELINES:
1. The evaluation and emergency medical care of any obstetrical patient presenting to the Emergency Department shall comply with the Georgia Emergency Medical Services to pregnant Women Act of 1984 and the Federal COBRA Act of 1986 and EMTALA (Emergency Medical and Labor Act) and they will be registered on the EMTALA log.
2. A gravid (pregnant) patient greater than 20 weeks, the Women's  Center charge nurse should be notified and will respond promptly to assess the patient.

II - Policy EMTALA- Medical Screening Examination and Stabilization Policy, Policy Number  08, last revised 05/2017, revealed the purpose was to establish guidelines for providing appropriate medical screening exam (MSE) and any necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer for the individual as required by EMTALA.
An EMTALA obligation is triggered when an individual comes to a dedicated emergency department (DED) and:
1. the individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an examination or treatment for a medical condition; or 
2. a prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.  Such obligation is further extended to those individuals presenting elsewhere on hospital property requesting examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC). Further, if a prudent layperson observer would believe that the individual is experiencing an EMC, then an appropriate MSE, within the capabilities of the hospital's DED (including ancillary services routinely available and the availability of on-call physicians), shall be performed. The MSE must be completed by an individual (i) qualified to perform such an examination to determine whether an EMC exists, or (ii) with respect to a pregnant woman having contractions, whether the woman is in labor and whether the treatment requested is explicitly for an EMC. If an EMC is determined to exist, the individual will be provided necessary stabilizing treatment, within the capacity and capability of the facility, or an appropriate transfer as defined by and required by EMTALA. Stabilization treatment shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (e.g., no different level of care because of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, , sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law).
Procedure:
1. When an MSE is Required 
A hospital must provide an appropriate MSE within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the DED, to determine whether or not an EMC exists: (i) to any individual, including a pregnant woman having contractions, who requests such an examination; (ii) an individual who has such a request made on his or her behalf; or (iii) an individual whom a prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior needs an MSE. An MSE shall be provided to determine whether the individual is experiencing an EMC or a pregnant woman is in labor. An MSE is required when:
a. The individual comes to a DED of a hospital and a request is made by the individual or on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, including where: 
i. The individual requests medication to resolve or provide stabilizing treatment for a medical condition. 
The MSE of the individual must be documented. This type of screening cannot be performed by the triage nurse. If an EMC is determined to exist and the hospital admits the individual as an inpatient for further treatment, the hospital's obligation under EMTALA ceases. 
Note: The MSE and other emergency services need not be provided in a location specifically identified as a DED. The hospital may use areas to deliver emergency services that are also used for other inpatient or outpatient services. MSEs or stabilization may require ancillary services available only in areas or facilities of the hospital outside of the DED.
b. The individual arrives on the hospital property other than a DED and makes a request or another makes a request on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for an EMC.
i. Screening where the individual presented: If an individual is initially screened in a department or location on-campus other than the DED, the individual may be moved to another hospital department or facility on-campus to receive further screening or stabilizing treatment without such movement being a transfer. The hospital shall not move the individual to an off-campus facility or department (such as an urgent care center or satellite clinic) for an MSE. 
3.  Extent of the MSE
 a. Determine if an EMC exists. The hospital must perform an MSE to determine if an EMC exists. It is not appropriate to merely 
""log in"" or triage an individual with a medical condition and not provide an MSE. Triage is not equivalent to an MSE. Triage entails the clinical assessment of the individual's presenting signs and symptoms at the time of arrival at the hospital in order to prioritize when the individual will be screened by a physician or other QMP.
 b. Definition of MSE. An MSE is the process required to reach, with reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether the individual has an EMC or not. It is not an isolated event. The MSE must be appropriate to the individual's presenting signs and symptoms and the capability and capacity of the hospital.
 c. An on-going process. The individual shall be continuously monitored according to the individual's needs until it is determined whether or not the individual has an EMC, and if he or she does, until he or she is stabilized or appropriately admitted     or transferred. The medical record shall reflect the amount and extent of monitoring that was provided prior to the completion of the MSE and until discharge or transfer.
 d. Judgment of physician or QMP. The extent of the necessary examination to determine whether an EMC exists is generally within the judgment and discretion of the physician or other QMP performing the examination function according to algorithms or protocols established and approved by the medical staff and governing board.
 e. Extent of MSE varies by presenting symptoms. The MSE may vary depending on the individual's signs and symptoms: 
i. Depending on the individual's presenting symptoms, an appropriate MSE can involve a wide spectrum of actions, ranging from a simple process involving only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that also involves performing ancillary studies and procedures such as (but not limited to) lumbar punctures, clinical laboratory tests, CT scans and other diagnostic tests and procedures. 
ii. Pregnant Women: The medical records should show evidence that the screening examination includes, at a minimum, on-going evaluation of fetal heart tones, regularity and duration of uterine contractions, fetal position and station, cervical dilation, and status of membranes (i.e., ruptured, leaking and intact), to document whether or not the woman is in labor. A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a physician, certified nurse-midwife or other QMP acting within his or her scope of practice as defined by the hospital's medical staff bylaws and State medical practice acts, certifies in writing that after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor. The recommended timeframe for such physician certification of the QMP's determination of false labor should be within 24 hours of the MSE, however, the medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations can provide guidance on the timeframe. 
4. Who May Perform the MSE
a. Only the following individuals may perform an MSE: 
i. A qualified physician with appropriate privileges; 
ii. Other qualified licensed independent practitioner (LIP) with appropriate competencies and privileges; or 
iii. A qualified staff member who: 
--is qualified to conduct such an examination through appropriate privileging and demonstrated competencies; 
--is functioning within the scope of his or her license and in compliance with state law and applicable practice acts (e.g., Medical or Nurse Practice Acts); 
-- is performing the screening examination based on medical staff approved guidelines, protocols or algorithms; and 
-- is approved by the facility's governing board as set forth in a document such as the hospital bylaws or medical staff rules and regulations, which document has been approved by the facility's governing body and medical staff. It is not acceptable for the facility to allow informal personnel appointments that could change frequently. 
b. Qualified Medical Personnel. QMPs may perform an MSE if licensed and certified, approved by the hospital's governing board through the hospital's by-laws, and only if the scope of the EMC is within the individual's scope of practice. 
i. The designation of QMP is set forth in a document approved by the governing body of the hospital. Each individual QMP approved to provide an MSE under EMTALA must be appropriately credentialed and must meet the requirements for annual evaluations set forth in the protocol agreements with physicians and the State's medical practice act, nurse practice act or other similar practice acts established to govern health care practitioners. Only appropriately credentialed Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN)s, Physician Assistants (PA)s and physicians may perform MSEs in the DED. 
iii. Labor and Delivery QMP. QMPs in the labor and delivery DED may be appropriately-approved RNs and must communicate their findings as to whether or not a woman is in labor to the obstetrician on call, the laborist, or the ED physician. 
iv. Limitations. The hospital has established a process to ensure that: 
--a physician examines all individuals whose conditions or symptoms require physician examination; 
--an ED physician on duty is responsible for the general care of all individuals presenting themselves to the emergency department; and 
--the responsibility remains with the ED physician until the individual's private physician or an on-call specialist assumes that responsibility, or the individual is discharged   . 

III - Women's '  Center Policy Policy Medical Screening Exam, Policy # 21, last revised 03/2019 revealed the purpose to provide guidelines to insure a MSE is performed by QMP on patients presenting to the OB department requesting treatment.
PURPOSE:
To provide a Medical Screening Examination to any patient presenting to the L&D by qualified nursing personnel utilizing the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tab in the electronic medical record.
1. Notify the physician of patient arrival and obtain orders to assess the patient using the Medical Screening Tool found in Centricity Perinatal (CPN) medical record. Physician notification should be made within 30 minutes of the patient's arrival to the department. If the patient is not an established patient with an obstetrician at Doctors Hospital, she must be assigned to the obstetrician on call. The OB on-call list is available in Labor and Delivery, as well as the E.D. 
2. Patients > 20 weeks pregnant may be evaluated in either the ED or L&D depending on the patient's presenting symptoms, unless the patient is unstable. Unstable patients will be evaluated and treated in the ED and stabilized prior to being transferred to L&D. The L&D RN will assist the ED staff as requested.
4. If the patient is discharged   , complete another MSE with update of status of discharge disposition. The physician must certify the orders within 24 hours if ""Read back and verified"" is not documented, otherwise the orders may be verified within 30 days of patient discharge. 
5. In the event of an emergency transfer to a higher level of care, and the physician is not physically present at the time of transfer, the QMP can sign the certification as long as the QMP is in consultation with the physician. Also, the physician must be in agreement with the certification and subsequently countersigns the certification. The date and time of such certification should closely match the date and time of transfer.
1. Obtain prenatal records if available and review. Notify physician of the patient's arrival. All OBED patients must have the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tool completed in CPN medical record found under the blue Admit tab. Results of medical screening will indicate if a provider must come in to examine the patient prior to discharge. 
2. Documentation of patient assessment should be complete, thorough and recorded in the CPN electronic patient chart. 
3. All fetal monitor strips are labeled or maintained and archived in the CPN system. 
4. An initial MSE will be completed on ALL OBED patients, printed and placed on medical record...if OBED patient is stable and discharged    undelivered, a reassessment MSE will be completed, printed and also placed on medical record. Please document required disposition on blue discharge tab.

During an interview on 4/08/19 at 11:10 a.m. Paramedic/Greeter BB said when pregnant patients arrive in the ED they are asked what is going on and what is their due date. If they are greater than 20 weeks and have any pregnancy related symptoms, they are immediately sent up to L&D for further evaluation.  She expounded that pregnancy related symptoms might be nausea, vomiting, swelling, water leaking or even headache which could be a sign of preeclampsia. If symptoms are questionable for pregnancy related, the registrar is to immediately call the ED Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner to come and evaluate.  

During the tour of the L&D unit on 4/8/19 at 11:30 a.m. an interview was conducted with L&D Clinical Director (EE).  She confirmed that the facility has a Level II Neonatal (newborn)Intensive Care Unit that can care for babies born after 32 weeks gestation (developmental age of the unborn baby) without any complications.  She said the L&D Unit will transfer a mother pending delivery prior to 32 weeks gestation to the hospital of her primary Obstetrician ' s choice.  

During an interview on 4/9/19 at 9:50 a.m. in the Conference Room, Paramedic BB, confirmed that she was the ED Greeter on 2/8/19.  The Paramedic explained that on 2/8/19 Patient #1 presented to the ED and reported that she was 29 weeks pregnant, had a headache and needed to go to L&D.  The Paramedic said she asked the patient if she was having any pregnancy related issues such as:  abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, back pain or pressure, pelvic pain, nausea or vomiting, if her water had broken or if her mucus plug (protective barrier that blocks bacteria from entering the uterus).  The Paramedic said Patient #1 denied any pregnancy related symptoms and repeated that she had a headache and need to go to L&D because she was 29 weeks pregnant.  The Paramedic said Patient #1 then went to the registration desk and told the Registrar that she was 29 weeks pregnant and needed to go to L&D because she had a headache.  Paramedic BB said the Registrar tried to register the patient but the patient got angry and turned to leave the ED.  Paramedic BB reported that Patient #1 stated I can't believe you aren't sending me to L&D, I'm 29 weeks pregnant, I have a headache, swelling and my blood pressure is high, just as the patient walked out the ED door.  The Paramedic said she then documented her note in the electronic medical record. Paramedic BB said she did not try to bring the patient back into the ED because the patient was angry and there were about 14 patients at the desk.  The Paramedic confirmed that she did not think about getting the Charge Nurse to speak with the patient.  The Paramedic said she has worked in the facility's ED since August 2017 and has been a Paramedic since 2006.  Paramedic BB stated that she receives EMTALA training annually and since this episode she has completed three (3) or four (4) OB related Healthstream courses.  

During an interview on 4/9/19 at 10:35 a.m. in the Conference Room, RN MM confirmed that she was working L&D on 2/8/19 and that she remembers providing care for Patient #1.  RN MM said she has been a RN since 2014, a L&D nurse since 2015, and has been working at the facility since February 2018.  The RN said she remembers that the L&D Charge Nurse informed her that Patient #1 would be arriving and that the patient was experiencing a headache and pregnancy induced hypertension (high blood pressure).  RN MM said she was setting up the room when Patient #1 arrived and that she helped the patient put on a gown and attached the fetal monitor (evaluates the baby's heartrate).  RN MM said she asked the patient what brought her to the hospital and was informed that the patient was seen by the Dr. KK in his office and had lab work, I think that day to see if the patient was pre-eclamptic.  RN MM reviewed her notes and said the patient's symptoms included:  headache, dizziness, seeing spots, nausea, vomiting and mild cramping.  RN MM explained that the patient was not admitted     at this point and had only been triaged by RN MM.  RN MM said she completed Patient #1's assessment and was informed by the patient that she was prescribed Labetalol but that she had forgotten to take her medication that day.  RN MM said her first thought was to call Patient #1's Dr. KK to get orders.  RN MM explained that she called the Patient's doctor KK and gave him an update of the patient's condition, the patient's blood pressure reading and informed the physician that the patient had missed taking her blood pressure medication. RN MM said she asked the physician what he wanted to do and he asked her to repeat the patient's blood pressure and then gave orders for the patient to be discharged    with instructions for the patient to go directly to another local acute care hospital.  RN MM said she thought this was odd and wondered whether this should be done.  RN MM said she asked the physician KK if he wanted the patient transported (by ambulance) and the physician replied ""no, just tell the patient to come straight here and not to go anywhere else"".  RN MM said she asked the physician KK if he wanted her to give the patient the Labetatol and he replied no.  RN MM said she discussed this with the L&D Charge Nurse and the L&D Charge Nurse asked about Patient #1's blood pressure and then told RN MM that the physician ordered the patient to be discharged    so that's what we will do. RN MM added that after speaking with the patient's physician it never occurred to her that the on-call OB physician could be contacted.  RN MM said that she received EMTALA training 4/7/19 but had also had EMTALA training in the past. RN MM confirmed that EMTALA training is required annually.  RN MM explained that she has also completed the Obstetrical Medical Screening Tool Healthstream training.  

During a phone interview on 4/9/19 at 12:30 p.m. with Dr. KK he reported that he remembered Patient #1.  He confirmed he was her primary OB and had seen her earlier in the week of 2/8/19 in his office.  He stated he had not sent her to the Emergency Department for evaluation.  He reported that Patient #1 did have chronic (persisting for a long time or recurring) hypertension (high blood pressure) and had shown some protein (small molecules that play critical roles in the body) in her urine (if high amounts of protein are found in the urine late in a pregnancy, it may indicate kidney disease or preeclampsia).  Dr. KK said he had sent labs off to be tested   and sent the patient to see a urologist (physician who specializes in the treatment of the urinary tract {body 's drainage system for removing urine}) to rule out kidney (bean shaped organs that filter blood to remove wastes and make urine) damage and preeclampsia.  Dr. KK reported he was at another acute care hospital in the local area when RN MM called to tell him his patient was at their facility.  He confirmed that RN MM had provided him with her assessment of the patient and given him all the vital signs.  He said he did not think the patient was that unstable. Dr. KK said he told RN MM where he was and asked that the patient not be admitted     to her facility but be sent over to where he was for further evaluation.  He explained that the facility where he was located at that time was not far and was able to provide specialized care if there were complications with the pregnancy.  He confirmed that RN MM asked about emergency transport by ambulance, but he said he did not think Patient #1 ' s condition warranted emergency transport. He confirmed that Nurse MM asked if he wanted Patient #1 to get her Labetalol at that time and he told her no.  Dr. KK said he assumed care when Patient #1 arrived at his location.  He said he evaluated her and told her they would just watch her for a few days in the hospital.  He said she was stable at that time.  He said he left the hospital and was called back to the hospital in less than 30 minutes.  When he arrived back at the hospital he found an emergency delivery was warranted and the baby was delivered by Cesarean-Section (surgery where the baby is taken out through the mother ' s abdomen).

Based on document review and interviews, the hospital obstetrical staff failed to provide an appropriate or sufficient medical screening exam for 1 obstetrical patient (patient #1), who presented to the obstetrical department requesting care, out of 10 cases selected for review from August 2010 to January 2011. The hospital emergency department staff also failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination for 1 emergency department patient (patient #1), who presented to the emergency department requesting care, out of 40 cases selected for review from August 2010 to January 2011. The hospital administrative staff identified an average of 293 patients in the Maternal Treatment and Triage Unit (MTTU) per month and an average of 6,200 emergency department visits per month.

Failure to provide an appropriate medical screening exam resulted in a patient with an emergency medical condition not receiving appropriate care, potentially leading to disability, loss of limb, or death.

Findings include:

1. Review of the medical record revealed Patient #1, who was 31 weeks pregnant and had  a history of gestational diabetes and previous bilateral adrenalectomy (which caused Patient #1 to have a high risk pregnancy and became  immunocompromised) arrived at the MTTU on 9/26/10 at 12:56 PM.

Interview with Resident #1 on 11/07/2018 at 1100 revealed he conducted the MSE on Patient #3. Interview revealed due to the CT scan findings the patient needed to be admitted     so he consulted on-call surgery.  Interview revealed he contacted Surgeon #1 and Surgeon #1 would not admit the patient and said to transfer the patient due to his splenic laceration.  

Interview with Surgeon #1 on 11/07/2018 at 1330 revealed he suggested to transfer the patient due to the ""possibility"" of needing interventional radiology procedures which Hospital A does not have.  Interview revealed he could perform a splenectomy but believes the care for Patient #3 was beyond the capabilities of the hospital.  Interview revealed ""a [AGE] year old patient should go to a trauma center.""  Interview revealed he would transfer out basic falls due to being traumatic in nature.  Review of Surgeon #1 credentialing file revealed ""Department: Surgery; Specialty: General Surgery Appointment Date 06/25/2018-06/24/2020."" Review of approved delineation of privileges revealed ""Abdomen Spleen- splenectomy (open and laparoscopic) and Abdomen: Spleen Splenorrhaphy.""

Interview with Surgeon #2 on 11/07/2018 at 1555 revealed grade II splenic injuries are treated without surgical intervention unless the injury begins to actively bleed. Interview revealed if the spleen bleeds he would treat depending upon the severity of blood loss. Interview revealed he recently cared for a patient (Patient #23) with a grade II splenic injury and they managed the patient at Hospital A by monitoring the hemoglobin and hematocrit for signs of bleeding.  Interview confirmed Hospital A has the capability to care for a patient with a grade II splenic laceration.  

The facility failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department to include ancillary services (Surgeon #1 on call 10/5/2018) to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed for patient #3 when he (MDS) dated [DATE].

Based on document review and staff interviews, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) administrative staff failed to ensure the ED staff followed the CAH's policies and ensure that 1 of 1 pregnant women (Patient #1) who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an emergency medical condition received an appropriate medical screening examination. Failure to provide an appropriate medical screening exam at the CAH resulted in Patient #1 being transported to Hospital A, which resulted in a delay of Patient #1 receiving an appropriate medical screening exam by more than 30 minutes. The administrative staff identified an average of 244 patients per month who presented to the CAH's dedicated emergency department and requested emergency medical care.

Findings include:   

1. Review of the CAH policy ""Transfer and Emergency Examination (EMTALA),""  approved 11/2020, revealed in part, ""Definitions ... Comes to the Emergency Department. ... the individual ... Is in a ground or air nonhospital-owned ambulance on Hospital Property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at a hospital's [Dedicated Emergency Department]."" ""Hospital Property. The entire main hospital campus, including the parking lot, sidewalk and driveway ...""

""Entitlement to medical screening examination. Any individual ... shall be provided an appropriate [medical screening examination] within the capabilities of the Emergency Department ..."" ""A pregnant woman experiencing contractions shall be provided a [medical screening examination].""

2. Review of Patient #1's medical record at the CAH revealed RN E retrieved Patient #1's demographics, allergies, and reported home medications from the CAH's electronic medical record system. RN E documented that Patient #1 arrived at the CAH at 9:42 PM on 4/11/21, with a chief compliant of ""OB Complications.""  The medical record did not contain any evidence that Patient # 1 received a medical screening examination.  

3. Review of Patient #1's medical record at Hospital A revealed that Paramedic D documented in Patient #1's medical record that an ambulance was dispatched to Patient #1's home for a female ""18 weeks pregnant, in labor."" Patient #1's chief complaint was ""ruptured placenta"" (tearing of the connection between mother and baby in the uterus, a life threatening emergency for the baby).  

Paramedic D initiated transport to the CAH, per Patient #1's request. Paramedic D called the CAH's ED and notified them that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and medical condition. During Patient #1's transport to the CAH, Patient #1 experienced ""pressure"" and ""contractions"" in the ambulance.

When the ambulance arrived at the CAH, the CAH staff instructed the EMS staff to divert the ambulance to Hospital A, as the CAH staff had closed the Obstetric (OB) unit. Patient #1 experienced contractions lasting less than 1 minute at 10:05 PM (23 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), 10:07 PM (25 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), and 10:10 PM (28 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

The ambulance containing Patient #1 presented to Hospital A at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 (31 minutes after presenting to the CAH). ED Physician H examined Patient #1 at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 and documented that Patient #1's water broke before 37 weeks of Patient #1's pregnancy (placing Patient #1's baby's life in jeopardy). ED Physician H consulted with ED Physician I at Hospital B, who agreed to accept Patient #1 for continued care. The ED staff at Hospital A transferred Patient #1 to Hospital B via a separate ambulance on 4/12/21 at 12:59 AM (137 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

4. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 9:10 AM, Paramedic D revealed they went to Patient #1's home in response to a 911 call. Upon the arrival of Paramedic D's ambulance at Patient #1's house, Paramedic D assessed Patient #1. During the assessment, Patient #1 revealed they received their normal care at the CAH. Based on Patient #1 receiving their care at the CAH, Paramedic D instructed the other EMS crew members to transport Patient #1 to the CAH.

Approximately 5 minutes prior to the ambulance arriving at the CAH, Paramedic D called the CAH and notified the CAH ED staff that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and current medical status. The CAH ED staff indicated the ED staff would see Patient #1 when the ambulance arrived at the CAH.

Upon the ambulance's arrival at the ED, Paramedic F (who worked at the CAH) informed the EMS crew that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services and the EMS crew should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A, as Patient #1 had an obstetrical chief complaint. Per Paramedic F's instructions, Paramedic D instructed the EMS crew to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A. During the transport from the CAH to Hospital A, Patient #1 began experiencing increasing contractions.

5. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 8:00 AM, Paramedic F (who worked for the CAH) revealed that RN E received a call informing RN E about an ambulance on its way to the CAH with an obstetrical patient. Paramedic F inquired why the ambulance staff chose to bring an obstetrical patient to the CAH, as the CAH lacked obstetrical services. When the ambulance arrived on the CAH's property, Paramedic F went out to meet the ambulance outside the ambulance bay. Paramedic F informed Paramedic D that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services, and Paramedic D should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A (which offered obstetrical services).

Based on document review and staff interviews, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) administrative staff failed to ensure the ED staff followed the CAH's policies and ensure that 1 of 1 pregnant women (Patient #1) who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an emergency medical condition received an appropriate medical screening examination. Failure to provide an appropriate medical screening exam at the CAH resulted in Patient #1 being transported to Hospital A, which resulted in a delay of Patient #1 receiving an appropriate medical screening exam by more than 30 minutes. The administrative staff identified an average of 244 patients per month who presented to the CAH's dedicated emergency department and requested emergency medical care.

Findings include:   

1. Review of the CAH policy ""Transfer and Emergency Examination (EMTALA),""  approved 11/2020, revealed in part, ""Definitions ... Comes to the Emergency Department. ... the individual ... Is in a ground or air nonhospital-owned ambulance on Hospital Property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at a hospital's [Dedicated Emergency Department]."" ""Hospital Property. The entire main hospital campus, including the parking lot, sidewalk and driveway ...""

""Entitlement to medical screening examination. Any individual ... shall be provided an appropriate [medical screening examination] within the capabilities of the Emergency Department ..."" ""A pregnant woman experiencing contractions shall be provided a [medical screening examination].""

2. Review of Patient #1's medical record at the CAH revealed RN E retrieved Patient #1's demographics, allergies, and reported home medications from the CAH's electronic medical record system. RN E documented that Patient #1 arrived at the CAH at 9:42 PM on 4/11/21, with a chief compliant of ""OB Complications.""  The medical record did not contain any evidence that Patient # 1 received a medical screening examination.  

3. Review of Patient #1's medical record at Hospital A revealed that Paramedic D documented in Patient #1's medical record that an ambulance was dispatched to Patient #1's home for a female ""18 weeks pregnant, in labor."" Patient #1's chief complaint was ""ruptured placenta"" (tearing of the connection between mother and baby in the uterus, a life threatening emergency for the baby).  

Paramedic D initiated transport to the CAH, per Patient #1's request. Paramedic D called the CAH's ED and notified them that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and medical condition. During Patient #1's transport to the CAH, Patient #1 experienced ""pressure"" and ""contractions"" in the ambulance.

When the ambulance arrived at the CAH, the CAH staff instructed the EMS staff to divert the ambulance to Hospital A, as the CAH staff had closed the Obstetric (OB) unit. Patient #1 experienced contractions lasting less than 1 minute at 10:05 PM (23 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), 10:07 PM (25 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH), and 10:10 PM (28 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

The ambulance containing Patient #1 presented to Hospital A at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 (31 minutes after presenting to the CAH). ED Physician H examined Patient #1 at 10:13 PM on 4/11/21 and documented that Patient #1's water broke before 37 weeks of Patient #1's pregnancy (placing Patient #1's baby's life in jeopardy). ED Physician H consulted with ED Physician I at Hospital B, who agreed to accept Patient #1 for continued care. The ED staff at Hospital A transferred Patient #1 to Hospital B via a separate ambulance on 4/12/21 at 12:59 AM (137 minutes after the ambulance presented to the CAH).

4. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 9:10 AM, Paramedic D revealed they went to Patient #1's home in response to a 911 call. Upon the arrival of Paramedic D's ambulance at Patient #1's house, Paramedic D assessed Patient #1. During the assessment, Patient #1 revealed they received their normal care at the CAH. Based on Patient #1 receiving their care at the CAH, Paramedic D instructed the other EMS crew members to transport Patient #1 to the CAH.

Approximately 5 minutes prior to the ambulance arriving at the CAH, Paramedic D called the CAH and notified the CAH ED staff that Paramedic D was transporting Patient #1 to the CAH, Patient #1's chief complaint, and current medical status. The CAH ED staff indicated the ED staff would see Patient #1 when the ambulance arrived at the CAH.

Upon the ambulance's arrival at the ED, Paramedic F (who worked at the CAH) informed the EMS crew that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services and the EMS crew should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A, as Patient #1 had an obstetrical chief complaint. Per Paramedic F's instructions, Paramedic D instructed the EMS crew to transport Patient #1 to Hospital A. During the transport from the CAH to Hospital A, Patient #1 began experiencing increasing contractions.

5. During an interview on 5/13/21 at 8:00 AM, Paramedic F (who worked for the CAH) revealed that RN E received a call informing RN E about an ambulance on its way to the CAH with an obstetrical patient. Paramedic F inquired why the ambulance staff chose to bring an obstetrical patient to the CAH, as the CAH lacked obstetrical services. When the ambulance arrived on the CAH's property, Paramedic F went out to meet the ambulance outside the ambulance bay. Paramedic F informed Paramedic D that the CAH did not offer obstetrical services, and Paramedic D should transport Patient #1 to Hospital A (which offered obstetrical services).
