Based on record review, observation, and interview during the Federal Survey, the Emergency Department (ED) staff failed to ensure that walk-in patients who presented to the ED were: (a) assessed prior to triage, and (b) continuously monitored after triage but before being provided with an Emergency Medical Screen Examination in fifteen (15) out of twenty-three (23) Medical Records reviewed (Patients #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #37, #38, #41, #43, #44, #46 and #47).

Findings:

(a) Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form revealed that Patient #29 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 6:13PM with complaints of chest pain.  No further documentation is noted until 11:00PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form for Patient #30 revealed the patient presented on ,d+[DATE] at 1:43PM with complaints of difficulty breathing.  No further documentation is noted until 11:00PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Review of the ""Quick"" Registration Form revealed that Patient #34 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 3:18PM with complaints of chest pain.  No further documentation is noted until 11:50PM when the patient is listed as discharged    without being seen.

Similar findings were identified in Medical Record reviews for Patients #28, #31, #32 and #33.

During the tour of the Adult Walk-In emergency room    Triage Area on 02/12/14 at 10:30AM Staff Member #17 stated on interview ""I ask the person why they are here, their date of birth, and first then last name which are entered into the system.  I then tell them to take a seat to wait for the Nurse and give them a Registration Form to complete while they wait.  If they complain of three (3) or four (4) of the things on the list (ED Registration Process), I must tell the Nurse right away. ""

Review of the ""ED Registration Process"" (Instruction Sheet) documents that Security greets the patient and directs them to Room #3 for Registration.  The Registrar will ask the patients why they are being seen and is to interrupt the ED staff if anyone complains of chest pain, shortness of breath, is under three (3) months of age, has epigastric pain or looks sick.  Otherwise they complete the Triage Quick Registration (then sit in the Triage Waiting Area in front of the Triage Cubicles).

On 02/19/14 at approximately 11:30AM Staff Member #9 stated that after a patient ""Quick"" registers, the patient waits in the Waiting Room until the Triage Nurse calls their name.  If the patient doesn't answer, the Triage Nurse tries to call/find the patient every fifteen (15) minutes until three (3) tries have been made.  She then stated that this was not a written policy, but a practice.  Staff #9 then stated there is ""no Patient Record"" because the patient has not been triaged yet, and therefore no place for the Nurse to document what time or how many tries were attempted to call/find the patient in the Waiting Room.  Staff #9 also stated because there was no place to document the attempts, there is no record of how long it took from the patient's ""Quick"" Registration until the Triage Nurse actually went to triage them.  Therefore there is no way to track how long the patients waited to see the Triage Nurse, after Quick Registering, before walking out of the facility.

This interview was conducted with Staff Member #16 who also confirmed the above information.

(b) Patient #46 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of right calf pain and swelling.  The patient also complained of being occasionally short of breath for the past two (2) weeks.  
The patient was registered at 6:36PM and triaged at 7:26PM with an Acuity Level III, fifty (50) minutes later. 

Patient #47 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and dizziness.  She states that she is possibly pregnant and has had left lower quadrant pain.  The patient was registered at 6:35PM as an Acuity Level II, but was triaged at 7:10PM, thirty-five (35) minutes later.

Patient #35 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of palpitations ""for months"".  She states that she was sent by her Primary Medical Doctor.  The patient was registered at 12:24PM and was triaged as an Acuity Level III at 1:10PM, forty-six (46) minutes later.

Patient #37 (MDS) dated [DATE] with a chief complaint of being treated for a blood infection for three (3) weeks.  The patient states that during the night he had ""itching and uncontrollable chills"".  The patient was registered at 12:07PM and was triaged with an Acuity Level II at 12:37PM, thirty (30) minutes later.

Additional findings were identified in Medical Record reviews for Patients #38, #41, #43 and #44.

These findings were confirmed on 02/19/14 with Staff Member #18 during review of each Medical Record.

Review of the Policy titled ""Triage"" dated 08/13/13 revealed ""all patients presenting to the ED will undergo the triage process"" and a priority level will be documented with Level II defined as a high risk situation and Level III requiring many resources"".  The Policy does not include the Quick Registration Process.  

The Policy titled ""Patient Initial Screening"" dated 08/13/13 states that ""the initial screening examination will be completed under the supervision of an Attending Physician after the patient has been triaged"".

REVIEW OF THE ""ED REGISTRATION PROCESS"" (INSTRUCTION SHEET) DOCUMENTS THAT SECURITY GREETS THE PATIENT AND DIRECTS THEM TO ROOM #3 FOR REGISTRATION.  THE REGISTRAR WILL ASK THE PATIENTS WHY THEY ARE BEING SEEN AND IS TO INTERRUPT THE ED STAFF IF ANYONE COMPLAINS OF CHEST PAIN, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, IS UNDER THREE (3) MONTHS OF AGE, HAS EPIGASTRIC PAIN OR LOOKS SICK.  OTHERWISE THEY COMPLETE THE TRIAGE QUICK REGISTRATION (THEN SIT IN THE TRIAGE WAITING AREA IN FRONT OF THE TRIAGE CUBICLES).

ON 02/19/14 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30AM STAFF MEMBER #9 STATED THAT AFTER A PATIENT ""QUICK"" REGISTERS, THE PATIENT WAITS IN THE WAITING ROOM UNTIL THE TRIAGE NURSE CALLS THEIR NAME.  IF THE PATIENT DOESN'T ANSWER, THE TRIAGE NURSE TRIES TO CALL/FIND THE PATIENT EVERY FIFTEEN (15) MINUTES UNTIL THREE (3) TRIES HAVE BEEN MADE.

Based on interviews and record review the facility failed to ensure patients requiring a higher or specialized level of care were transferred appropriately pursuant to EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) in 2 of 11 medical records reviewed in which patients where transferred out of the facility (Patient #7 and #12). 

Findings include:

Facility policy:

The policy, Emergency Department Transfer of Patients read, documentation of patient stabilization had been prepared by a physician or qualified medical person in consultation with a physician. The policy also read, the transferring hospital should document its communication with the receiving hospital, including the date and time of the transfer request and the name of the person accepting the transfer. The receiving facility must ensure it has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual, and has agreed to accept the transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment.

The policy, Admission to the emergency room    read, the provider shall determine whether the patient had an emergency medical condition and if necessary, stabilize the patient and/or admit the patient or initiate a transfer under medical necessity. 

The policy, Transfer of Patients: For a Patient Being Transferred to Another Health Care Facility read, the primary care provider was responsible to notify the receiving primary care provider and institution. The policy also read, the facility must copy appropriate medical records and complete patient transfer forms and orders, including a nursing summery and a care plan for the receiving facility.

1. The facility failed to ensure the receiving facility agreed to accept the patients for transfer and provide available documentation including patient consents. 

a. Patient #7 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 12:37 p.m. with contractions. The patient was documented to be 40 weeks and three days pregnant with her fourth child.

At 12:44 p.m. Patient #7 was examined by Physician #4 and according to emergency department provider assessment the patient was experiencing contractions two to three minutes apart with no loss of fluid or bleeding. 

At 12:49 p.m. Physician #4 documented Patient #7 needed to be transferred to a different facility (Facility B) for further labor and delivery care and that delivery was not imminent at that time. 

At 12:54 p.m., according to the prehospital report the patient was transported out of the facility by ambulance to Facility B. Further documentation revealed RN #11 told the emergency medical technician (EMT) to take the patient prior to all paperwork being completed and she would have paperwork completed upon the EMT's return to the facility.  

b. On 5/15/18 at 12:46 p.m. an interview was conducted with Physician #4 who had cared for Patient #7 on 4/8/18. Physician #4 stated the appropriate process for transferring a patient out of the facility included calling the receiving facility to confirm they had available beds, obtaining acceptance of the patient by a physician, giving report and filling out the proper paperwork to transport the patient. 

Physician #4 stated after he examined Patient #7, he determined the patient needed to be transferred to a facility with appropriate obstetrics care and ordered the transport team to take the patient to a different facility. Physician #4 stated, the emergency transport service crew were at the patient's bedside, ready to take the patient at that time.  

Physician #4 stated he did not call the receiving facility until approximately 20 minutes after the patient left and no paperwork was filled out or completed prior to transfer. 

c. On 5/15/18 at 3:59 p.m. an interview was conducted with Registered Nurse #11 who cared for Patient # 7 on 4/8/18. RN #11 stated she called report to Facility B and spoke with a registered nurse in the emergency department and the labor and delivery department after Patient #7 left the facility. 

RN #11 stated paperwork sent with the patient typically included the consent, any nursing documentation, vital signs and any testing completed (lab and radiology). RN #11 stated it was important to send as much information to the receiving facility so they could get the full picture of what was occurring with the patient. 

RN #11 stated Physician #4 did not fill out paperwork and sign the consent for transfer until 4:30 p.m. on 4/8/18. This was 4 hours after the patient left the facility. RN #11 was unsure what paperwork had been sent with the patient and was unsure if any paperwork had been faxed by the unit clerk after it had been completed by Physician #4. 

d. Similar findings were found in Patient #12's medical record. 

On review of Patient #12's medical record, the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:50 a.m. Patient #12 was triaged with a primary and secondary assessment were completed at 10:56 a.m. by Registered Nurse (RN) #1. RN #1 documented Patient #12's chief complaint as suicidal with a specific plan. 

At 11:14 a.m., the physician documented, on the ED Provider Assessment, that Patient #12 was brought in by ambulance with a history of bipolar, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder and a recent admission to a psychiatric facility for suicidal ideation's and with worsening suicidal ideation's. The patient was seen at a clinic yesterday, 11/20/17, and was noted to ""currently struggle with suicidal ideation."" 

At 11:41 a.m., RN #1 documented under the nursing assessment notes, Patient #12 was suicidal with a plan to overdose on her medications and complained of increased depression, anxiety and sadness. 

At 1:10 p.m., on the vitals signs flow sheet, it was documented Patient #12 took pills approximately 10-15 minutes ago. Review of the Emergency Nursing Record revealed RN #1 documented the patient came up to the nurses station and said she took approximately 60 pills about 15 minutes ago. 

At 2:35 p.m., a crisis evaluation was conducted. In the crisis evaluation, the crisis clinician documented Patient #12 was in need of stabilization inpatient treatment at a involuntary facility. 

At 6:42 p.m., RN # 1 documented the patient was being transferred under the care of the receiving facility physician and report to the RN at the receiving facility had been completed. RN #1 further documented all documents were ready for transport.

Review of Patient #12's record revealed no documentation that the physician caring for Patient #12 communicated with the receiving hospital, including the date and time of the transfer request and the name of the person accepting the transfer. This was in contrast to facility policy. 

On 5/15/18 at 1:31 p.m., an interview was conducted with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) #6. CMO #6 stated the facility policy was to call the receiving facility to ensure the receiving facility had the capability and capacity to care for the patient who was needing to be transferred. The physician then spoke to the receiving physician who accepted the patient called a ""doc to doc."" This was all required prior to the patient being transported. CMO #6 stated it was important for the doc to doc communication to be completed to ensure a safe handoff of patient care because the most dangerous part of transporting patients was when the patient was outside the facility and have access to less resources. CMO #6 stated receiving acceptance of a patient and then providing a doc to doc allows for the receiving team to prepare for the patient and identify if any changes in the patient's condition had occurred while in transient.  
 
CMO #6 on review of Patient #12's medical record confirmed there was no documentation on when the doc to doc had occurred and no documentation of what paperwork had been sent with the patient prior to being transported. CMO #6 stated the physician consent for transfer should always be completed and sent with the patient prior to being transported.

She stated at approximately 2:00 AM, Patient #1 presented to the registration desk and stated he/she was having labor contractions and that the patient's water had ""broken.""  Patient Registration Clerk #1 stated she informed the patient the facility did not offer obstetrical services and that he/she needed to go to another facility.

Interview with the facility's Administrator on 09/02/14 at 2:00 PM also confirmed the CNO informed her of the incident on 07/02/14.  The Administrator stated Patient Registration Clerk #1 was suspended immediately after the incident occurred.  In addition, according to the Administrator, although the facility had provided staff with information and training related to providing all patients that presented to the ED with a medical screening prior to the incident, the facility immediately began retraining all facility staff, including Patient Registration Clerk #1, of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requirements, to include the provision of medical screening.

The facility located in the adjacent community, that Patient Registration Clerk #1 had directed Patient #1 to, Facility #2, was contacted in an effort to obtain information related to patients that had presented to their facility on 07/02/14 in active labor.  Facility #2 provided a copy of a medical record of a patient that had presented to Facility #2 in active labor; however, attempts to contact the patient on 09/05/14, 09/06/14, 09/07/14, and 09/08/14 were unsuccessful.

A.  Based on review of facility policy and procedure, medical record review, and staff interview, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that pregnant patients presenting to OB Triage are assigned an acuity level to prioritize when the individual will be seen by a physician or other QMP. 

Findings include: 

Reference: Facility policy and procedure titled ""Guidelines for Assessment and Triage of Obstetric Patients"" states, ""1. Upon arrival to the Labor Triage Room, the registered nurse will perform a focused nursing assessment to verify the patient's clinical status ... 3. The registered nurse will give a patient status report to the physician (resident/attending), who will perform a medical screening exam (MSE) ...""

1.  Lack of documentation in Medical Records #2, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #13 and #14 indicated that the patients were not assigned an acuity level in OB triage. 

2.  Review of the policy and procedure referenced above, lacks evidence of a process to assign an acuity level to OB patients, so as to prioritize when the patient will be seen by a physician or other QMP.

3.  This was confirmed by Staff #12.

Based upon record review and interview, the facility failed to ensure 1 (#1) of 30 patients' medical records reviewed had received an appropriate medical screening examination in the Emergency Department and failed to follow the facility policy. 

Findings at Health Facility A on 09/04/2013:

Review of policy titled, ""Medical Screening Exam and Referral in the Emergency Department; Reference #1202 a: DATE Effective: 10/2011"" revealed: 

""Purpose: The purpose of the medical screening examination (MSE) is to determine with reasonable clinical confidence and within the capability of the Emergency Department (and the ancillary services routinely available to the Emergency Department) whether or not an individual who comes to the Emergency Department has an emergency medical condition. The MSE will be performed in a non-discriminatory manner, by qualified medical personnel as detailed below.

Policy Statement: All individuals presenting to be seen in the Emergency Department will be provided an appropriate MSE by Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP). A QMP includes physicians and nurses who are members of the medical staff who practice within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors, Medical Staff, Texas Medical Board, and Texas Board of Nursing. This includes but is not limited to the scope of licensure, certification, education and experience of the QMP. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or Emergency Department registered nurses who have received specialized training, demonstrated appropriate competence for performing appropriate MSE's will function under standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.

Based on whether the patient meets any exclusion criteria and the results of this MSE, the patient may either be directed to the Rural Health Clinic or Emergency Department for further medical examination and treatment. If an emergency medical condition is determined to exist, the hospital will provide any necessary stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer.

The MSE must be the same MSE that would be performed on any individual coming to the Emergency Department, regardless of the individual's ability to pay. No information regarding the patients' payer status, HMO/PPO membership, or insurance shall be asked prior to the completion of the MSE.

After patients presenting to the ED will have a MSE completed by a QMP. This screening examination may be performed in the Emergency Department by a registered nurse who has been determined by the Chief Nursing Office and Emergency Department Nurse Manager to be qualified and experienced in emergency nursing and who is required to follow standardized protocols approved by the Medical Staff Executive Committee.  In the event the registered nurse performing the screening examination is uncertain about the nature of the patient's condition or the existence of an emergency, the patient will be referred to the Emergency Department physician for further screening.

The nature of the MSE will depend on the patient's presenting symptoms, and may only a brief history and physical examination.

I. The medical screening examination consists of:
a. Assessment of the patient's chief complaint
b. Vital signs
c. General appearance of the patient
d. Mental status
e. Location and degree of pain based on both subjective and objective data
f. Skin-visual inspection and tactile assessment when indicated
g. Ability to walk/limits on ambulation or movement of affected extremity
h. A focused physical assessment-appropriate to the organ system related to the chief complaint
i. Exclusionary criteria questions

VI, Exclusionary Criteria Questions:
1. Is the patient's presenting complaint related to pregnancy?
2. Is the patient's presenting complaint related to a Psychiatric illness?
3. Is the patient four (4) years old or younger?
4. Is the patient sixty-five (65) years old or older?
5. Is the patient's presenting complaint a result of a Motor Vehicle Crash which has occurred within the past 7 days?
6. Is the patient's presenting complaint a work related injury?
7. Does the patient have VA benefits?

*If any of the answers are Yes, stop the MSE and admit patient to the ED. ""

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Triage Log"" from 03/01/2013 thru 08/31/2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the triage log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Elopement Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the elopement log.

A review of the facility's record titled, ""Transfer Log"" for the month of August 2013 revealed patient #1 was not on the transfer log.

A review of twenty-nine medical records at Health Facility A revealed no medical record for patient #1. 

Findings at Health Facility B on 09/05/2013 at 8:30 AM:

A review of patient #1's medical record at Health Facility B revealed patient was admitted on [DATE] at 9:50 PM. Nurses notes revealed ""After triage, this patient informed me that she had presented to triage at Health Facility A, and was told that  ""we can't help you here."" States she was told they did not do OB (obstetrics), and could not do ultrasounds and that they were too busy to see her at all for several hours and that she should go to Mount Pleasant. She also states that as they were passing through Pittsburg, they called ahead to Pittsburg, and were told by the ER  (emergency room   ) there that they too did not ""do babies"" and that she should go on to Mount Pleasant.""  

According to the labor and delivery admission assessment for patient #1, the assessment stated, ""pt (patient) admitted     to ldr1 (labor room #1) with c/o (complaints) of contractions, states receives prenatal care in Longview. Pt crying and restless with contractions, strong contractions palpated, sve (sterile vaginal examination) reveals bulging membranes and almost completely dilated. Patient's boyfriend and his mother arrived with pt. They are visibly upset and crying about inevitable, nonviable delivery and being ""turned away from Gilmer."" Mother states they stopped at Health Facility A (ER) first and were turned away. When questioned further the mother states that when they signed in to the ER  they were told that the hospital does not delivery babies and that the ER  was very busy trying ""to save someone's life"" and it would be ""hours and hours"" before the patient would be able to be seen. The patient was advised to go to either Longview or Mount Pleasant hospital to be seen by a hospital that delivers babies. The patient, her boyfriend and his mother then left and started on their way to Mount Pleasant. En route to Mount Pleasant the mother called Pittsburg ER  via mobile phone and inquired about whether they should stop there. They were told the best place would be Mount Pleasant since they were already on their way and Mount Pleasant delivered babies. Due to patient's condition, this information was obtained by the paternal grandmother of the fetus to which the patient agrees.""  

Patient delivered spontaneous vaginal delivery 20 week fetal demise on August 19, 2013 at 6:17 AM. Patient discharged    home from Health Facility B on 08/21/2013 at 9:41 AM.   

A phone interview with family member #16 on 09/05/2013 at 10:30 AM stated, ""My son called and said we are on our way to the emergency room    in Gilmer my girlfriend is having bad cramps. I told him I was on my way, and when I drove up to the emergency room    in Gilmer, my son and his girlfriend were coming out the door of the emergency room   . They told me this emergency room    doesn't deliver babies and we would have to go to Longview or Mount Pleasant. I chose Mount Pleasant because it's a better road and it's a straight shot. On the way I called Pittsburg emergency room    because it's on the way to Mount Pleasant and my son's girlfriend was hurting so bad.  They informed me they don't deliver babies either and I need to go on to Mount Pleasant. So we went to Mount Pleasant Hospital.""

A phone interview with patient #1 on 09/05/2013 at 11:10 AM stated, ""I went to the Gilmer emergency room    on   Sunday August 18th around 8:00 PM with my boyfriend. I was having bad cramping. I sat down where you register for an emergency room    visit. I signed a piece of paper. The clerk told me ""I didn't tell you this, but it will be hours before someone sees you because the emergency room    is busy and they are trying ""to save someone's life."" We don't take care of babies here."" The clerk told me Mount Pleasant or Longview is the closest place. My boyfriend and I left. My boyfriend's mother drove us to Mount Pleasant. Patient #1 was questioned did you see a nurse or physician before you left? She stated, ""No.""

On a return visit back to Health Facility A on 09/05/2013 at 12:00 PM requested the emergency room    clerk schedule. Staff member #17 was the admitting clerk working the evening of August 18th, date in question.

A phone interview with staff #17 on 09/05/2013 at 12:10 PM stated, ""I remember patient #1 because she left her social security card that night. It is in the top drawer where I sit in the second registration desk area. Staff member #17 was questioned did patient #1 sign into the emergency room   . Staff #17 stated, she signed the piece of paper that asks for name, date of birth, social security#, and reason for visit. I remember there was patient behind her saying why are you checking into this hospital they don't deliver babies. I had to leave the area and take papers to the nurses in the emergency room   . When I came back the patient asked me if this hospital delivers babies? I am not supposed to give out any information, but when patient asks a direct question I can answer. So I told her, ""no we don't deliver babies here, the closest places are Longview and Mount Pleasant."" They got up and left. Staff member #17 was questioned as to what happened to the piece of paper the patient signed? She stated, ""I put it in the shred box when they left."" Staff #17 was questioned as to whether patient saw a nurse or a physician? She stated, ""No.""

An interview with the Director of the Emergency Department on 09/05/2013 at 12:30 PM confirmed, if any patient had presented to the emergency room    the patient would have been registered by the clerk and the patient would have signed the paper that request name, date of birth, social security #, and reason for visit. 

On 09/05/2013 at 12:35 PM the emergency room    Manager and I went to the emergency room    registration area. We found the patient's original social security card in the top drawer of the second registration desk, where staff member #17 told me she had placed it.

An interview with the Administrator, Chief Nursing Officer, and the emergency room    Manager, confirmed the patient #1 original social security card was left at the registration desk. Patient #1 had not received a medical screening, nor was the patient on the triage log, elopement log, and transfer log. Also the facility policy for medical screening examinations had not been followed.

Based on record review and interview the facility failed to ensure patients (#s 2; 3; 8; 9; 13; 22; and 29) who had presented to the Emergency Department (ED) were provided with medical screening exams (MSE) by a qualified provider (physician or midlevel practitioner) to determine if a medical emergency existed prior to being sent to their appointments in the Outpatient Department (OPD) located in another area of the hospital.  In addition, 2 patients (#23) and (#30) were referred back to the ED when the OPD determined they were unable to meet the patient's needs.  One patient (#7) presented to the ED, was sent to the OPD, went back to the ED with worsening headaches, and was then referred back to the OPD. These failed practices denied all patients who presented to the ED their rights to a MSE by a qualified provider and placed them at risk for not receiving emergency services.  Findings: 

I.  ED Patients sent to OPD and refered back to ED 

Patient #23 

Review of the ED log on 12/6/12 revealed the Patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:29 am for ""bleeding [times] 3 days"". Review of the ""Emergency Visit Record"", dated 11/26/12 at 10:29 am, revealed ""Appointment made for OPD for 11:30 this day"". There was no evidence the Patient was triaged (a mechanism of rapid evaluation and prioritization of patients presenting for emergency care) by a nurse or received a MSE by a provider prior to being sent to the OPD. 

Review of the OPD ""Nurse Narrative"" dated 12/6/12 revealed, ""Pt. was brought from the ER  [emergency room   ]but she was referred back to the ER  by the provider.""

Patient #29

Review of the ED log on 12/6/12 revealed the Patient (MDS) dated [DATE] with  ""Pain/check up on arm"" at 12:55 pm. Review of the ""Emergency Visit Log"", dated 8/13/12, revealed ""OPD"". There was no evidence in the ED record the Patient was triaged by a nurse, nor was there evidence the Patient was provided with a MSE. 

During an interview on 12/6/12 at 9:15 am, the Medical Director (MD) was asked about the ED process of sending patients to the OPD. The MD stated the facility did not have a process in place to ""fast-track"" (a process that streams patients with less urgent complaints into a dedicated area) patients. In addition, the MD stated the OPD was a completely separate department. When asked specifically about Patient #23 being sent to the OPD for an appointment and then having to return to the ED, the MD replied the OPD appointment was inappropriate because the Physician's Assistant (PA) the patient was scheduled to see [in the OPD] was not privileged to do obstetrics. The MD confirmed only a provider would be qualified to perform the MSE. 

During an interview on 12/6/12 at 9:50 am, when asked about the process for sending ED patients to the OPD, the OPD Manager replied the decision to start doing it had started at an Electronic Health Record (EHR) meeting last year. It was his understanding patients were to be triaged by a nurse prior to being sent over to the OPD for an appointment. In addition, he added the facility initiated this process to try to get patients to use the ED ""appropriately"". The OPD Manager stated he was the Acute Care Manager (including the ED) when this process was initiated. During the interview, the OPD Manager stated the nurses were to use the ESI (Emergency Severity Index) method to triage every patient that checked into the ED. 

III  Licensed Nurse (LN) signing as provider

Futher review ""Emergency Visit Record"" in the ED records for 14 of the Patients revealed a LN signed off as the provider.

During an interview on 12/6/12 at 4:00 pm The Director of Compliance and Quality Services  confirmed LN's should not be signing as providers.  

During an interview with the Director of Nursing (DON) on 12/6/12 at 9:30 am, when asked about patients being sent to the OPD without receiving a medical screening exam, the DON replied the ED patients are always triaged by an ED nurse. The DON added the new procedure ""It's like a fast-track"". 

Review of the policies provided by the facility revealed there were no policies that defined when nurses were supposed to perform a triage or if a nurse triage qualified as a MSE. Furthermore, there were no ED policies that defined when an OPD appointment should be made and who should be making those appointments. There were no policies that defined if patients leaving the ED (even for treatment in other departments), prior to being screened, were leaving against medical advice. 

During an interview on 12/6/12 at 1:50 pm, when asked where they could find a policy on triaging the ED patients, LN #s 1, 2, and 3, working in the ED, responded it should be in the new policy program. After 15 minutes, LN #2 was able to find a policy from a different hospital. During the interview LN #s 1, 2, and 3 were unable to find any facility policies pertaining to the ED. Nor was there a policy about offering the ED patients an appointment in the OPD.

Review of the Medical Staff Bylaws and the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations revealed no definition of a medical screening exam or any reference to who is qualified to do a medical screening exam.

Review of the Medicaid claim forms provided by the facility on 12/7/12 revealed the ED and the OPD were billed as separate departments. 

Review of the facility's policy titled ""Patient Rights and Responsibilities"", dated 9/29/09, revealed, ""If you are in labor or have a medical emergency, you have a right to receive an appropriate medical screening examination necessary stabilizing treatment (including treatment for an unborn child), and if necessary, an appropriate transfer to another facility...""

Based on interview and record review the hospital (Hospital 1) failed to provide an appropriate medical screening exam (MSE) for one of 21 sampled patients (Patient 1).

On 4/15/16 at approximately 4 am, Patient 1 presented to Hospital 1 complaining of the inability to urinate and requesting a catheter (tube inserted into the bladder to drain urine) to be placed.  Registered Nurse (RN) B spoke to a physician about Patient 1 but the physician did not examine or otherwise provide a medical screening exam to Patient 1.  Patient 1 then went to the Emergency Department (ED) at Hospital 2 where he received a MSE and treatment for his condition. 
 
This failure to perform a MSE had the potential to result in a significant worsening of Patient 1's condition.

Findings:

Hospital 1's policy titled ""Cobra/EMTALA Transfer Policy/Protocols,"" last reviewed 5/27/15, was reviewed. It read as follows: ""It is the policy of the hospital to provide appropriate medical response, screening, and stabilization to determine the nature and extent of any injury, medical condition, and/or pregnancy within its capabilities of persons needing or asking for assistance within the hospital 'campus'. The definition of campus includes the main hospital building, clinic, hospital owned ambulance and a zone of 250 yards surrounding the main hospital building. . . . . All persons presenting at the hospital campus requesting treatment shall be provided a medical screening exam for the purpose of determining whether they suffer from an emergency medical condition or are pregnant with contractions present.  Screening will include necessary testing to rule out any condition with potential health risks.""


During an interview on 4/27/15 at 4 :30 pm, RN B stated Patient 1 came in to the hospital on [DATE] at approximately 4 am, complaining of inability to urinate and requesting a catheter (tube placed to drain urine) to be placed. Patient 1 reported he'd had the same problem about a year prior and had been catheterized at that time.  Patient 1 told RN B he had urinated 300 milliliters (ml) about two hours prior.  RN B said he advised Dr. A of Patient 1's complaint and, was told by Dr. A, to tell Patient 1 to return to the lab at 8 am for a urinalysis (urine test). RN B advised Patient 1 of the above instructions who then told RN B he was going to go to the ED at Hospital 2. 

A review of  Patient 1's record at Hospital 2 indicated he (MDS) dated [DATE] and was examined by the ED physician at 4:45 am.  Patient 1's chief complaint was ""can't pee"" and initial blood pressure was 220/116 (normal is 120/80) and pulse 97 (normal range is 60-100). A catheter was placed and drained 1000 ml of urine. The ED physician documented the following, ""He drove to the ED at Hospital 1, arriving there at approximately 4 am.  The nurse contacted the physician on duty and the physician on duty told the nurse to tell the patient that they could not do anything about this until 9 am.  Because of that Patient 1 drove over Cedar Pass where he says it was not snowing too badly, he just had to drive slowly and came to our ED for evaluation and relief.""  The records indicated Patient 1 was homeless and lived in his van in the general vicinity of Hospital 1.

A review of Hospital 1's on-call physician list for 4/2016 listed Dr. A as being off until 8 am on 4/15/16 and Dr. C as being on call.  

During an interview on 4/27/16 at 12:10 pm, Dr. A confirmed he was not on duty until 8 am on 4/15/16.  He said if a nurse called him before he was on duty he would have told the nurse to call Dr. C.  He said he does not recall receiving a phone call about a patient complaining of inability to urinate.  Dr. A said he would not tell a patient to come back.  He stated if a patient had urinary retention (inability to completely empty the bladder) that was ""something you can't put off"". 

During an interview on 4/27/15 at 4:30 pm, RN B was asked to review the 4/2016 physician on call list.  RN B did so and checked another on-call list kept at the nurses station and confirmed Dr. C, and not Dr. A, was the on-call physician listed for 4/15/16 at 4 am.  RN B confirmed he was sure he spoke to Dr. A who told him to tell Patient 1 to return at 8 am.  RN B said he recognized Dr. A's voice and he has Dr. A's phone number on his personal cell phone which he looked at before calling.

In a signed statement, RN E (RN who works in the ED at Hospital 2) stated she spoke to RN B who told her he had spoken to Dr. A who advised him to tell Patient 1 to come back at 8 am for a urinalysis.  

During an interview on 4/18/16 at 6:25 pm, RN B stated, before starting to work at this hospital, he had no prior ED experience.  He stated he didn't enter Patient 1's name on the ED log because he didn't know about the log.  RN B said he did not take Patient 1's vital signs because after he told Patient 1 to return at 8 am, as advised by Dr. A, Patient 1 said he was leaving to go to Hospital 2. 

During an interview on 4/27/16 at 2:25 pm, the Human Resources Director (HRD) said she was unaware of any orientation checklist for the ED.  HRD said RN B ""shadowed"" a couple of the other ED nurses when he first started work at the facility.  She confirmed he started working directly for the hospital on [DATE] but had worked for a few weeks prior through a nursing agency.

During an interview on 4/27/16 at 3 pm, DON stated there was no orientation checklist for the ED, although there should be one and there was no designated person to complete the orientation for a new hire.  DON stated for the first few days RN B was scheduled, he would have worked with another nurse but after that he'd been on his own.

A. Based on document review and staff interview, it was determined for 1 of 4 (Pt #1) obstetrical patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED), the hospital failed to provide an appropriate transfer. This has the potential to affect all obstetrical patients receiving care in an ED that treats approximately 34 patients a day.

Finding include:

1.  On 08/31/2022 at approximately 9:30 AM the policy, ""OB: Maternal Transfer (revised October 2009)"" was reviewed. The policy stated ""Policy: Maternal patients >20 weeks will be transferred to the appropriate level of care... B. Maternal-Fetal Transport Data: All patients who are potentials for transfer to another facility should have the following available: Current vital signs, Fetal Heart Tones, Medical Screening, Presence of vaginal discharge (ie bleeding, amniotic fluid), IV fluids, previous and current medical records if available. Procedure: A. Assess the patient prior to transfer. "" 

2.  On 08/31/2022 at approximately 11:45 AM, an interview was conducted with the Director of Quality and Safety (E #1) and the Chief Nursing Officer (E #3). E #1 stated ""We had received a phone call from the Perinatal Center with concerns related to a pt who presented to (Receiving Facility) stating that (Pt #1) had presented to our facility with concerns that (Pt #1's) water had broke. We started an investigation. Initially, there was no patient record (not on the log). Based on information provided by the Perinatal Center and a review of our cameras in the ED, we determined when the patient presented and when the patient left. We created a Sensor (Patient Safety) event and spoke with the nurse.""

3. On 08/31/2022 at approximately 2:00 PM, Pt #1's record from the Receiving Facility was reviewed. Pt #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 11:45 PM and was taken to Obstetrical Triage Room #1. Pt #1's ""OB History and Physical"" stated, ""(Pt #1) ... is being admitted     for emergent cesarean section cesarean section due to PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) with prolapse of fetal part and fetal bradycardia (low heart rate).... Per patient report, (Pt #1) has spontaneous rupture of membranes at 10:00 PM. (Pt #1) called the (primary OB's office) Telenurse and was advised to seek evaluation for rupture of membranes at (Transferring Hospital). Patient and partner reported that (Pt #1) was triaged and advised to come directly to (Receiving Hospital) as (Transferring Hospital) would not be able to intervene. It does not appear that the patient was evaluated by a physician or that fetal heart tones were obtained prior to leaving outside facility. (Pt #1) presented to triage, and on exam by (Maternal Fetal Medicine physician), (Pt #1) was noted to have a fetal arm prolapsing into the vagina. A Code Mom was initiated and the patient was transferred to the OR emergently. In the OR, BSUS (bedside ultrasound) demonstrated transverse (cross-lying) fetus. Fetal heart tones were not able to be obtained with external cardiotocography (continuous recording of the fetal heart rate obtained by an ultrasound transducer placed on the mother's abdomen) and fetal heart tones were unable to be visualized on BSUS (bedside ultrasound) with Doppler; however, possible fetal bradycardia was noted. FSE (fetal scalp electrode)was placed and FHT (Fetal Heart Tones) were indeterminate. She underwent an emergent classical cesarean section... delivered infant who was 930 grams (2 pounds 0.8 ounces) and had APGARs (describes the condition of the newborn at 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes of life.  It is scored based on muscle tone, pulse, reflex irritability, skin color, and respiration) of 0, 0, 0 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes (indicating demise) respectively."" The ""OB Cesarean Delivery Operative Note"" stated, ""(Pt #1) reports that (Pt #1) had been experiencing cramping since 8/6/2022. On 8/9/2022, (Pt #1) felt worsening cramping and the sensation to have a bowel movement. While attempting to have bowel movement, (Pt #1) noted a large gush of clear fluid at 22:00. (Pt #1) subsequently presented to (receiving facility) for evaluation.... decision was made to proceed with an emergent cesarean section.""  

4. On 09/01/2022 at approximately 2:00 PM an interview was conducted with ED RN (E #4). E #4 stated ""OB patients get triaged, assessed (including vitals and fetal heart tones), and then we notify the ED physician. After the medical screening exam (MSE), the physician will make a determination on the need for transfer and determine the means of transport (whether Advanced Life Support ambulance, transfer team from the receiving facility, or if capable of taking a private car).  Pt #1 did not receive a medical screening exam so there was no determination made of the need for transfer or appropriate way to transfer""     



B. Based on document review and interview, it was determined that for 3 of 10  (Pt #8, Pt #12 and Pt #14), clinical records reviewed for transfer, the Hospital failed to complete the transfer forms. This has the potential to affect all patients receiving care in an ED that treats approximately 34 patients a day.

Findings include:

Based on a review of policies and procedures, medical records, and interviews with staff, the critical access hospital (CAH) failed to: 
1.  ensure staff followed the CAH's EMTALA policies requiring staff  to complete  a Qualified Medical Professional (QMP) or physician report to the receiving facility QMP (physician) and explain risks and benefits of the transfer of 4 of 7 sampled mental health patients requiring transfer from the CAH's ED (Emergency Department) to acute care hospitals for patient records reviewed from 9/24/14 to 2/16/15 (Patient #1, 3, 4 and 10); and

2.  ensure CAHs obstetric staff followed the CAH's EMTALA policies requiring OB staff to maintain a complete OB log for 2 of 2 sampled OB patients that presented to the CAH with emergency medical conditions and were transferred to acute care hospitals (Patients #19 and 20). 

Failure of the sending hospital to complete a QMP report for the receiving hospital physicians and to explain risks and benefits to ED patients with emergency medical conditions that necessitated transfer to acute care hospitals could result in a delay in care for the transferred patients after arrival at the recipient hospitals.  Failure to maintain a complete OB log that included all OB patients presenting to the CAH ED or the OB department of the CAH resulted in the lack of a system to track those OB patients who were not admitted     and delivered a baby.  

According to information obtained from the CAH at the time of the investigation, the CAH furnished emergency services to an average of 285 patients per month in the ED or other areas of the hospital.  The average number of patients receiving emergency care in the OB department was not tracked by the OB staff and was not known.

FAILURE OF THE SENDING HOSPITAL TO COMPLETE A QMP REPORT FOR THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS AND TO EXPLAIN RISKS AND BENEFITS TO ED PATIENTS WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT NECESSITATED TRANSFER TO ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS COULD RESULT IN A DELAY IN CARE FOR THE TRANSFERRED PATIENTS AFTER ARRIVAL AT THE RECIPIENT HOSPITALS.  FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE OB LOG THAT INCLUDED ALL OB PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE CAH ED OR THE OB DEPARTMENT OF THE CAH RESULTED IN THE LACK OF A SYSTEM TO TRACK THOSE OB PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT ADMITTED     AND DELIVERED A BABY.

Based on documentation and interviews, the hospital failed to ensure that each patient who presented to the emergency department received a medical screening examination, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed, in one of twenty-one patients reviewed (Patient #1). Findings include:

Documentation and interviews revealed that patient #1 went into labor during the night of 11/21/11 and  her labor progressed more rapidly than patient #1 expected. Person (F) drove patient #1 to the local hospital (SCBH) for care, although it was originally planned that she would deliver at another hospital (RMH) which was several miles from (SCBH). Person (F) went to the front door of the emergency department and informed nurse (C) that patient  #1 was in the car and in labor. In response to person (F's ) request for care, nurse (C) told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and that he should continue to drive to their original destination, RMH. Patient #1's labor became more severe on the way to RMH, so person (F) stopped the car, called 911 and delivered the baby in the car. The ambulance arrived and transported patient #1 and the baby to RMH.

Review of patient #1's 11/21/11 ambulance record confirmed that on 11/21/11, at 3:44 a.m., a 911 call was received and an ambulance was dispatched to an identified location on a highway between Benson, MN and Willmar, MN. The request for an ambulance was related to child birth and upon arrival the paramedics observed patient #1 in the passenger seat of the vehicle with her baby lying on her chest. The paramedics examined patient #1 and the baby and determined that they were both stable. Patient #1 and the baby were transported by ambulance to RMH for ongoing care. 

Review of patient #1's 11/21/11 hospital record confirmed that patient #1 was admitted     to RMH at 4:17 a.m. and that person (F) and patient #1 had requested care at SCBH prior to the delivery of the baby in the car.

Person (F) was interviewed by phone on 12/12/11, and he confirmed that when he and patient #1 went to the ED at  SCBH seeking care for patient #1 during the night of 11/21/11. He stated he pushed the ED button and nurse (C) came out to the car and told him SCBH did not provide obstetrical services. When person (F) requested that nurse (C) call an ambulance for patient #1, nurse (C) refused and told person (F) to continue driving to his intended destination, RMH.

Nurse (C) was interviewed in person on 12/15/11, and she confirmed that patient #1 was not provided a medical screening examination and further assistance when she arrived at the ED in labor on 11/21/11. She stated she told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and told him to continue driving to his intended destination, RMH. She stated she did not attempt to call an ambulance for patient #1 and did not inform RMH that patient #1 was on her way.  

Nurse (D) was interviewed in person on 12/15/11, and she stated she was working the 11/21/11 night shift on a unit adjacent to the ED. She stated she heard the ED buzzer ring and followed nurse (C) out the ED door because she was concerned about her safety. Nurse (D) stated she was holding the ED door open and clearly overheard the entire conversation between nurse (C) and person (F) that occurred by person (F's) car. She stated nurse (C) told person (F) that SCBH did not provide obstetrical services and told person (F) to continue driving to RMH. Nurse (C) did not offer patient #1 a medical screening examination and when person (F) asked if an ambulance should be called, nurse (C) replied ""no."" Patient #1 was sitting in the passenger seat of the car and looked very uncomfortable.  

The hospital's EMTALA policy, dated March 2010 and revised on 1/5/11, states ""All patients presenting to the ER  (emergency room   ) will be given a medical screening exam. Any patient with an EMC (Emergency Medical Condition) or in labor will be stabilized. Appropriate transfer will be provided when patient requests or SCBH does not have capability or capacity to provide the necessary treatment.""

BASED ON DOCUMENTATION AND INTERVIEWS, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO ENSURE THAT EACH PATIENT WHO PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION EXISTED, IN ONE OF TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS REVIEWED (PATIENT #1). FINDINGS INCLUDE:

DOCUMENTATION AND INTERVIEWS REVEALED THAT PATIENT #1 WENT INTO LABOR DURING THE NIGHT OF 11/21/11 AND  HER LABOR PROGRESSED MORE RAPIDLY THAN PATIENT #1 EXPECTED. PERSON (F) DROVE PATIENT #1 TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL (SCBH) FOR CARE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED THAT SHE WOULD DELIVER AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL (RMH) WHICH WAS SEVERAL MILES FROM (SCBH). PERSON (F) WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INFORMED NURSE (C) THAT PATIENT  #1 WAS IN THE CAR AND IN LABOR. IN RESPONSE TO PERSON (F'S ) REQUEST FOR CARE, NURSE (C) TOLD PERSON (F) THAT SCBH DID NOT PROVIDE OBSTETRICAL SERVICES AND THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE TO THEIR ORIGINAL DESTINATION, RMH. PATIENT #1'S LABOR BECAME MORE SEVERE ON THE WAY TO RMH, SO PERSON (F) STOPPED THE CAR, CALLED 911 AND DELIVERED THE BABY IN THE CAR. THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED AND TRANSPORTED PATIENT #1 AND THE BABY TO RMH.

REVIEW OF PATIENT #1'S 11/21/11 AMBULANCE RECORD CONFIRMED THAT ON 11/21/11, AT 3:44 A.M., A 911 CALL WAS RECEIVED AND AN AMBULANCE WAS DISPATCHED TO AN IDENTIFIED LOCATION ON A HIGHWAY BETWEEN BENSON, MN AND WILLMAR, MN. THE REQUEST FOR AN AMBULANCE WAS RELATED TO CHILD BIRTH AND UPON ARRIVAL THE PARAMEDICS OBSERVED PATIENT #1 IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE VEHICLE WITH HER BABY LYING ON HER CHEST. THE PARAMEDICS EXAMINED PATIENT #1 AND THE BABY AND DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE BOTH STABLE. PATIENT #1 AND THE BABY WERE TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO RMH FOR ONGOING CARE. 

REVIEW OF PATIENT #1'S 11/21/11 HOSPITAL RECORD CONFIRMED THAT PATIENT #1 WAS ADMITTED     TO RMH AT 4:17 A.M. AND THAT PERSON (F) AND PATIENT #1 HAD REQUESTED CARE AT SCBH PRIOR TO THE DELIVERY OF THE BABY IN THE CAR.

PERSON (F) WAS INTERVIEWED BY PHONE ON 12/12/11, AND HE CONFIRMED THAT WHEN HE AND PATIENT #1 WENT TO THE ED AT  SCBH SEEKING CARE FOR PATIENT #1 DURING THE NIGHT OF 11/21/11. HE STATED HE PUSHED THE ED BUTTON AND NURSE (C) CAME OUT TO THE CAR AND TOLD HIM SCBH DID NOT PROVIDE OBSTETRICAL SERVICES. WHEN PERSON (F) REQUESTED THAT NURSE (C) CALL AN AMBULANCE FOR PATIENT #1, NURSE (C) REFUSED AND TOLD PERSON (F) TO CONTINUE DRIVING TO HIS INTENDED DESTINATION, RMH.

Based on the facility self report;  interviews of nursing staff, a physician, and a paramedic; and review of the hospital's documentation, policies and procedures; the facility failed to comply with the agreement of the special responsibilities in emergency cases  for 1 of 31 sampled emergency patients [Patient 31] by failing to provide Patient 31 with a medical screening examination [MSE].  The hospital had come back into compliance with EMTALA requirements at the time of the investigation.

Findings are:

     A.  Review of Medical Staff Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations confirmed the hospital did have the EMTALA requirements for Medicare Hospitals included.  The hospital Policy and Procedure titled  ""Medical Screening Examination & Stabilization""  [MSE] was last revised and approved 11/2014 by the Medical Staff and the Governing Body.  The policy directs that an MSE obligation is triggered when:
     1. ""The individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an     examination or treatment for a medical condition or
      2.  A prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.""
     The policy continues to define that the MSE (the determination of an emergency medical condition) is to be determined by a physician or qualified medical practitioner.  The policy defines who may perform an MSE to include:  a qualified physician with appropriate privileges ... a physician's assistant, or an advanced practice registered nurse who has been credentialed and is a member of the medical staff approved by the governing board [with the appropriate privileges and within their scope of practice].
     The policy includes the definition of an MSE for a pregnant woman which should include at a minimum:   ongoing evaluation of fetal heart tones, regularity and duration of contractions, fetal position and station, cervical dilation, and status of membranes (ruptured, leaking or intact).
       B.  The Administrator [CEO], Chief Operating Officer [COO], and the Manager of ED  learned of the incident from an email from the Registered Nurse that diverted Patient 31 from the ambulance bay of the hospital on [DATE] [RN-A].  The CEO and COO met with the Director of Nursing, the Manager of ED and other administrative staff on 1/12/2015.  They knew this was a violation of EMTALA and decided they must report it.  The CEO called and then emailed the self-report on 1/14/2015.  
      C.  The facility had pursued corrective action to achieve compliance with the EMTALA requirements prior to the investigation.  The initial step taken was to counsel RN-A and the physician who had directed the ambulance be diverted [MD-B], which was accomplished on 1/12/2015.  Verification was found in interviews with RN-A and MD-B, as well as review of facility documentation.  The facility revised its policies and procedures related to transfers to ensure they were more clear regarding EMTALA requirements.  The training was provided to all Medical Staff including all mid-level practioners on the Medical Staff.  The training was also provided to all nursing staff.  The training included improvement of communication between nursing staff and physicians or mid level providers.  These meetings were completed on 1/15/2015, prior to the survey start of 1/16/2015.  This training was verified by review of the materials presented and sign in sheets.  The staff had to complete competencies that were confirmed by review of the copies of the certificates for all medical staff and all nursing staff.  Three (3) nursing staff that had not attended the meetings will not be able to work until they have had the training according to the Director of Nursing.  The facility has scheduled training (by another hospital who provides labor and obstetric services) for management of imminent delivery and neonatal care on  2/5/2015 for their staff.   The facility has also contracted with a hospital to provide annual training on care of patient in labor and newborns.

BASED ON THE FACILITY SELF REPORT;  INTERVIEWS OF NURSING STAFF, A PHYSICIAN, AND A PARAMEDIC; AND REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S DOCUMENTATION, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES; THE FACILITY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN EMERGENCY CASES  FOR 1 OF 31 SAMPLED EMERGENCY PATIENTS [PATIENT 31] BY FAILING TO PROVIDE PATIENT 31 WITH A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION [MSE].  THE HOSPITAL HAD COME BACK INTO COMPLIANCE WITH EMTALA REQUIREMENTS AT THE TIME OF THE INVESTIGATION.

FINDINGS ARE:

     A.  REVIEW OF MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS, AND RULES AND REGULATIONS CONFIRMED THE HOSPITAL DID HAVE THE EMTALA REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICARE HOSPITALS INCLUDED.  THE HOSPITAL POLICY AND PROCEDURE TITLED  ""MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION & STABILIZATION""  [MSE] WAS LAST REVISED AND APPROVED 11/2014 BY THE MEDICAL STAFF AND THE GOVERNING BODY.  THE POLICY DIRECTS THAT AN MSE OBLIGATION IS TRIGGERED WHEN:
     1. ""THE INDIVIDUAL OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTING ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S BEHALF REQUESTS AN     EXAMINATION OR TREATMENT FOR A MEDICAL CONDITION OR
      2.  A PRUDENT LAYPERSON OBSERVER WOULD CONCLUDE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL'S APPEARANCE OR BEHAVIOR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AN EXAMINATION OR TREATMENT OF A MEDICAL CONDITION.""
     THE POLICY CONTINUES TO DEFINE THAT THE MSE (THE DETERMINATION OF AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION) IS TO BE DETERMINED BY A PHYSICIAN OR QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER.  THE POLICY DEFINES WHO MAY PERFORM AN MSE TO INCLUDE:  A QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN WITH APPROPRIATE PRIVILEGES ... A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT, OR AN ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE WHO HAS BEEN CREDENTIALED AND IS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL STAFF APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD [WITH THE APPROPRIATE PRIVILEGES AND WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE].
     THE POLICY INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF AN MSE FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE AT A MINIMUM:   ONGOING EVALUATION OF FETAL HEART TONES, REGULARITY AND DURATION OF CONTRACTIONS, FETAL POSITION AND STATION, CERVICAL DILATION, AND STATUS OF MEMBRANES (RUPTURED, LEAKING OR INTACT).
       B.  THE ADMINISTRATOR [CEO], CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER [COO], AND THE MANAGER OF ED  LEARNED OF THE INCIDENT FROM AN EMAIL FROM THE REGISTERED NURSE THAT DIVERTED PATIENT 31 FROM THE AMBULANCE BAY OF THE HOSPITAL ON [DATE] [RN-A].  THE CEO AND COO MET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING, THE MANAGER OF ED AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ON 1/12/2015.  THEY KNEW THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF EMTALA AND DECIDED THEY MUST REPORT IT.  THE CEO CALLED AND THEN EMAILED THE SELF-REPORT ON 1/14/2015.  
      C.  THE FACILITY HAD PURSUED CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE EMTALA REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO THE INVESTIGATION.  THE INITIAL STEP TAKEN WAS TO COUNSEL RN-A AND THE PHYSICIAN WHO HAD DIRECTED THE AMBULANCE BE DIVERTED [MD-B], WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON 1/12/2015.  VERIFICATION WAS FOUND IN INTERVIEWS WITH RN-A AND MD-B, AS WELL AS REVIEW OF FACILITY DOCUMENTATION.  THE FACILITY REVISED ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO TRANSFERS TO ENSURE THEY WERE MORE CLEAR REGARDING EMTALA REQUIREMENTS.  THE TRAINING WAS PROVIDED TO ALL MEDICAL STAFF INCLUDING ALL MID-LEVEL PRACTIONERS ON THE MEDICAL STAFF.  THE TRAINING WAS ALSO PROVIDED TO ALL NURSING STAFF.  THE TRAINING INCLUDED IMPROVEMENT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURSING STAFF AND PHYSICIANS OR MID LEVEL PROVIDERS.  THESE MEETINGS WERE COMPLETED ON 1/15/2015, PRIOR TO THE SURVEY START OF 1/16/2015.  THIS TRAINING WAS VERIFIED BY REVIEW OF THE MATERIALS PRESENTED AND SIGN IN SHEETS.  THE STAFF HAD TO COMPLETE COMPETENCIES THAT WERE CONFIRMED BY REVIEW OF THE COPIES OF THE CERTIFICATES FOR ALL MEDICAL STAFF AND ALL NURSING STAFF.  THREE (3) NURSING STAFF THAT HAD NOT ATTENDED THE MEETINGS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK UNTIL THEY HAVE HAD THE TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING.  THE FACILITY HAS SCHEDULED TRAINING (BY ANOTHER HOSPITAL WHO PROVIDES LABOR AND OBSTETRIC SERVICES) FOR MANAGEMENT OF IMMINENT DELIVERY AND NEONATAL CARE ON  2/5/2015 FOR THEIR STAFF.   THE FACILITY HAS ALSO CONTRACTED WITH A HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE ANNUAL TRAINING ON CARE OF PATIENT IN LABOR AND NEWBORNS.

An onsite complaint investigation 



Based on record review, staff and provider interviews, review of the facility Medical Staff Rules and Regulation and the Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) policies the facility failed to ensure 1 of 20 sampled patients (Patient 5) received an adequate Medical Screening Exam (MSE) to ensure the patient was stable at discharge.  The hospital's failure to provide an adequate MSE to ensure that Patient 5 did not an emergency medical condition.   

Findings are:

A.  Review of the facility policy dated 9/13/07  titled ""Transfer and Emergency Examination"" identified that the  Medical Screening Examination (MSE)  as ""An examination within the capability of the Hospital's Emergency Department, including ancillary services routinely available to the Emergency Department, to determine with reasonable clinical confidence whether an EMC (Emergency Medical Condition) exists.  The MSE must be provided by Qualified Medical Personnel, as defined at Section ll, B of this Policy and Procedure.  A Qualified Medical Personnel is identified for the Critical Access Hospital as Physician, Physician Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner.  

Review of the facility policy further identifies an EMC as:
1) Medical/Psychiatric:  A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in: a) Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, b) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or c) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

Review of the hospital's Medicare Database Worksheet verified by the hospital administrator on 9/7/17 revealed the hospital's capabilities include a dedicated Emergency Department, pediatric services and no pediatric ICU.

Review of a closed medical record showed Patient 5 presented to the ED (Emergency Department) on 7/9/17 at 1338 (1:38 PM) complaining of abdominal pain.  The pediatric patient's parents further informed staff that the patient had intermittent fevers with a temperature as high as 104 degrees in the last 48 hours, loose stools yesterday and yellow loose stools in the morning with some dark color, no vomiting, very fussy and complains of stomach ache.  

A review of the finalized dictated 'emergency room    Note' signed 7/19/17 at 1023 by the Physician Assistant (PA) - B  which treated Patient 5 in the ED on 7/9/17 revealed,   ""The patient has been running a fever for the last 24-48 hours.  Last night, it was actually up to 104 and they (parents) did call in and spoke with the staff last night who advised to continue with Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  They have been alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen.  (Patient 5)  has had a decrease of oral intake in terms of food.  Is still drinking water, but has had a decrease in that.  (Patient 5) does not appear to be dehydrated.  Has good tearing, good skin trugor and good capillary refill.  (Parent) decided to have an evaluation today.  (Parent) also reports that the child has had several watery loose stools today in addition to the decreased intake that (Patient 5) has been taking.  Has had one episode here which appears to be concentrated urine without evidence of fecal matter.  The child appears in moderate distress.  (Parent) was concerned about the child's appendix.  We discussed this at length."" 
PHYSICAL EXAM included:  
-temperature 101 degrees; pulse 157; respirations 28; blood pressure 114/61 and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air.  
-TM's (tympanic membrane- eardrum) both bulging with purulent fluid and some striation
-Abdomen is soft, has hyperactive bowel sounds
-Good skin turgor, good capillary refill of less than 2 seconds and good tearing.  Appears to be well hydrated at this point
-LABS: White Blood Count (WBC) 18.8 [normal range 5.5-15.5]; Hemoglobin 15 [normal range 11-14.7]; Hematacrit (Hct) 43.9 [normal range 33-43]; Platelets (Plt) 323 [normal range 150-450];  Bands 7 with normal morphology [normal range 1-5]. Strep A Antigen- negative
ASSESSMENT: 
1) Bilateral otitis media, 2) Enteritis, 3) Diarrhea
PLAN AND COURSE:
-Started on Amoxil 400/5ml 1-1/2 teaspoons here and then the rest of the bottle to go with 1-1/2 teaspoons BID (twice a day) for 10 days.  Alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen. Push oral fluids.  If not improved in 24 hours then return to the clinic or ED for follow up.

During a telephone interview on 9/7/17 at 11:15 AM with Physician Assistant - B (PA-B) that took care of the patient, stated, I remember I was here seeing other patients in the ED that day when this patient came in.  The child looked ill, not gravely ill, was crying and tearing.  The child was consolable by the parents and looked hydrated the color was good.  The parents told me that the child wasn't eating good but was drinking, and had some diarrhea.  We had seen GI (gastrointestinal) stuff the weekend with other patients.  Did not get immunizations per parents choice.    My exam showed an ear infection, runny nose and hyperactive bowel sounds. I ordered a Strep test because Strep can cause GI issues, also a CBC (complete blood count) and looked at the WBC, Plt, Hgb, no anemia, WBC slightly elevated but not abnormal morphology of cells, had a wide differential.  Had ear infections, ok WBC, tummy issues we would see with gastroenteritis that we had been seeing.  I was called to look at a specimen in the stool, what was in the (collection) hat looked like concentrated urine, no fecal matter was present.  The parents were worried about the appendix, but in this age group it is very rare and the exam didn't show it.  I did not do a CT (computerized tomography-mulitple pictures of inside the body) Scan due to it gives the child a ""ton"" of radiation and at this point the risk did not out weigh the benefit.  It is shown that  children with CT Scans can have a 25% increase in cancer later in life.  I visited with the parents about the abdominal complaints and fussiness.  They said the child is still taking water.  The child looked hydrated so let them go home and told them to give it time.  Use the Amoxil, Tylenol and Motrin and return immediately if not better or getting worse.   ""I did not feel that the child at any time had an EMC (emergency medical condition), it looked like gastro enteritis, was stable on discharge, taking fluids, well hydrated, the CBC looked ok with only a slightly elevated WBC, overall stable.""  I did find out that this child returned the next day and was transferred to a higher level of care and later passed away.  I asked my self what else I could have done/run to pick it up sooner, if I did stool cultures, we have to send them out from here and would take 4 days to get back so, a CMP (complete metabolic profile)  I don't know that would of helped.  With the timeframe of the return visit the results would not have changed it.

DURING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW ON 9/7/17 AT 11:15 AM WITH PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT - B (PA-B) THAT TOOK CARE OF THE PATIENT, STATED, I REMEMBER I WAS HERE SEEING OTHER PATIENTS IN THE ED THAT DAY WHEN THIS PATIENT CAME IN.  THE CHILD LOOKED ILL, NOT GRAVELY ILL, WAS CRYING AND TEARING.  THE CHILD WAS CONSOLABLE BY THE PARENTS AND LOOKED HYDRATED THE COLOR WAS GOOD.  THE PARENTS TOLD ME THAT THE CHILD WASN'T EATING GOOD BUT WAS DRINKING, AND HAD SOME DIARRHEA.  WE HAD SEEN GI (GASTROINTESTINAL) STUFF THE WEEKEND WITH OTHER PATIENTS.  DID NOT GET IMMUNIZATIONS PER PARENTS CHOICE.    MY EXAM SHOWED AN EAR INFECTION, RUNNY NOSE AND HYPERACTIVE BOWEL SOUNDS. I ORDERED A STREP TEST BECAUSE STREP CAN CAUSE GI ISSUES, ALSO A CBC (COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT) AND LOOKED AT THE WBC, PLT, HGB, NO ANEMIA, WBC SLIGHTLY ELEVATED BUT NOT ABNORMAL MORPHOLOGY OF CELLS, HAD A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL.

THE PARENTS WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE APPENDIX, BUT IN THIS AGE GROUP IT IS VERY RARE AND THE EXAM DIDN'T SHOW IT.  I DID NOT DO A CT (COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY-MULITPLE PICTURES OF INSIDE THE BODY) SCAN DUE TO IT GIVES THE CHILD A ""TON"" OF RADIATION AND AT THIS POINT THE RISK DID NOT OUT WEIGH THE BENEFIT.  IT IS SHOWN THAT  CHILDREN WITH CT SCANS CAN HAVE A 25% INCREASE IN CANCER LATER IN LIFE.  I VISITED WITH THE PARENTS ABOUT THE ABDOMINAL COMPLAINTS AND FUSSINESS.  THEY SAID THE CHILD IS STILL TAKING WATER.  THE CHILD LOOKED HYDRATED SO LET THEM GO HOME AND TOLD THEM TO GIVE IT TIME.  USE THE AMOXIL, TYLENOL AND MOTRIN AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY IF NOT BETTER OR GETTING WORSE.   ""I DID NOT FEEL THAT THE CHILD AT ANY TIME HAD AN EMC (EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION), IT LOOKED LIKE GASTRO ENTERITIS, WAS STABLE ON DISCHARGE, TAKING FLUIDS, WELL HYDRATED, THE CBC LOOKED OK WITH ONLY A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WBC, OVERALL STABLE.""  I DID FIND OUT THAT THIS CHILD RETURNED THE NEXT DAY AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE AND LATER PASSED AWAY.  I ASKED MY SELF WHAT ELSE I COULD HAVE DONE/RUN TO PICK IT UP SOONER, IF I DID STOOL CULTURES, WE HAVE TO SEND THEM OUT FROM HERE AND WOULD TAKE 4 DAYS TO GET BACK SO, A CMP (COMPLETE METABOLIC PROFILE)  I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD OF HELPED.  WITH THE TIMEFRAME OF THE RETURN VISIT THE RESULTS WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED IT.

Based on hospital policy and procedure review, closed medical record review, and staff and physician interviews, the hospital staff failed to provide within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital, further medical examination and treatment as required to stabilize 1 of 23 patients with a mental health emergent medical condition (Patient #9).

The findings include:  

Review of the EMTALA - Transfer Policy dated 04/14/2012 revealed ""... If an individual (or the individual's designated representative) comes to the (name of hospital) emergency department (ED) requesting (or a prudent layperson observer would assume the individual would be requesting) medical care and an EMC (emergency medical condition) is identified, the hospital must provide and appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) and either: further medical examination and treatment, including hospitalization   if necessary, as required to stabilize the medical condition within the capabilities of its staff and facilities; or a transfer to another more appropriate or specialized facility after provision of treatment necessary to minimize the risks to the health of the individual or in the case of a pregnant woman, to the unborn child. ...""

Closed medical record review of Patient #9 revealed a [AGE] year-old male that arrived in the dedicated emergency department (DED) via police on 09/20/2013 at 1350 for involuntary commitment (IVC).  Review of the triage notes at 1351 recorded mobile crisis (contract staff that provide behavioral assessments) was en route for evaluation.  Review revealed the patient was ""excited"" and stated that he ""had lost his woman.""  Vital signs were recorded as blood pressure (BP) 110/74, pulse (P) 100, respirations (R) 18 and temperature (T) 97.6 Fahrenheit.  Review of the triage notes recorded the patient ""Pt (patient) denies SI (suicidal ideations.  States he wants to hurt the man raping his girlfriend.  Denies visual/auditory hallucinations.  Pt is delusional. ...""  Review of the notes revealed the patient was homeless.  
Nursing notes at 1455 recorded that mobile crisis staff was in the DED to evaluate the patient.  Review of the mobile crisis assessment  conducted at 1431 revealed the patient thinks that a local pawn shop owner is raping his girlfriend.  The patient told the police officer that he would hurt the man for keeping his girlfriend from him.

1. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure the use of an appropriate mode of transportation for 1 of 16 sampled records (Patients #1) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to use an appropriate mode of transportation put the patients at risk of not receiving appropriate care during transfer.

Findings include:

The physician is responsible for determining the appropriate mode of transport, equipment, and transporting professionals to be used for the transfer. . . .""

- Reviewed on January 11-12, 2011, the medical record for Patient #1 indicated the patient sought medical assistance from the facility for shortness of breath and weakness on 10/24/10. The record lacked evidence the physician completed a medical screening examination. Failure to complete an appropriate medical screening examination did not allow the physician to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed, whether the patient's medical condition was stabilized before transfer, and the appropriate mode of transporatation. The emergency room    Note, dated 10/24/10, stated, "". . . Apparently the patient has had [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]since April of this past year. She has been tolerating things relatively well until the last 2 days when she has become progressively short of breath, weaker, and unable to get around much at all. She was scheduled to see [name of physician] for electrical conversion . . . she [patient's daughter] was especially worried about what to do since her mother appeared to be getting worse and wondered about how she could see a cardiologist. . . . [name of patient's daughter] will drive her mother to the emergency room    at [name of receiving facility]. The patient was stable when she left, I see no problem with them driving via automobile. I did not think it was necessary to do a formal emergency room    consult as the daughter basically brought her mother in with the question of how she could get her seen sooner rather than wait until she was seen as things were going. The daughter said that she was worried that she would run out of time and that her mother would die. . . ."" An addendum to the emergency room    Note, dated 10/24/10 at 5:36 [unspecified as a.m. or p.m.], stated, "". . . I had nothing to offer this patient here so I did not do EKG's [electrocardiogram], lab, chest x-rays, and the like . . .""

During a telephone interview on 01/14/11 at 10:40 a.m., the receiving emergency department physician (#9), stated he could not believe the condition the patient was in when she walked into the ER. This physician (#9) stated the patient did not have much time left, maybe an hour and the outcome would have been mu[DIAGNOSES REDACTED]erent. This physician (#9) said he would expect rudimentary work-up, breathing treatment, O2 (oxygen), dose of steroid, and transfer via ambulance (not a private car) in case a problem arose on the way. The patient arrived at the receiving facility with no physician note or documentation showing that anything was done at the transferring facility.


2. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure the physician certified the medical benefits outweighed the risks at the time of transfer for 3 of 16 sampled records (Patients #3, #4, and #8) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to ensure the physician certified the medical benefits outweighed the risks for transfer placed the patients at risk of receiving an inappropriate transfer.

The individual may be transferred if a physician or, should a physician not physically be present at the time of the transfer, a Qualified Medical Person in consultation with a physician has documented on the 'Physician Certification' section of Exhibit A that the medical benefits expected from transfer outweigh the risks.

During interview on 01/12/11 at 1:45 p.m., an administrative nursing staff member (#2) confirmed the medical records for Patients #3, #4, and #8 lacked evidence the physician certified the medical benefits outweighed the risks at the time of transfer.

3. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure the receiving facility agreed to accept the transfer and provide treatment for 2 of 16 sampled records (Patients #5 and #8) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department and failed to document the date and time the CAH made the transfer request to the receiving facility for 16 of 16 sampled records (Patients #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #14, #15, #17, #18, and #21) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to ensure the receiving facility agreed to accept the transfer and provide treatment, placed the patient at risk of not receiving treatment upon transfer.

During interview on 01/12/11 at 1:45 p.m., an administrative nursing staff member (#2) confirmed the medical records for Patients #5 and #8 lacked evidence the receiving facility agreed to accept the transfer and provide treatment; and the medical records for Patients #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #14, #15, #17, #18, and #21 lacked evidence of the date and time the CAH contacted the receiving facility to request acceptance of transfer and provision of treatment.

4. Based on policy/procedure review, record review, and interview, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) failed to ensure staff sent the medical records related to the emergency condition to the receiving facility for 10 of 16 sampled records (Patients #1, #3, #4, #7, #8, #10, #12, #15, #17, and #18) reviewed of patients transferred to another facility from the CAH's emergency department. Failure to ensure staff sent pertinent medical records to the receiving facility, placed the patient at risk of not receiving appropriate treatment at the receiving facility.

Based on review of hospital policies and procedures, medical records, and interviews with hospital staff, the hospital failed to enforce its policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of 42 CFR 489.24 by not providing an appropriate medical screening examination for one (Patient #1) of five pregnant patients thought to be in active labor.  And for transfer of two (Patients #1 and #5) of six patients who had an emergency medical condition (EMC) requiring transfer to another acute care hospital, and whose medical records were reviewed.

Findings:

1.  The hospital's policy, ""Guidelines for Emergency Department Services"", revised 10/05/09, on page 2 appropriately defines stability for women in labor.  The policy documents ""...This standard also states that a pregnant woman is not legally stable until the baby and placenta have been delivered."" On bottom of page 3 and top of page 4, the policy defines, ""Emergency medical conditions include:...Pregnancy with contractions (defined as unstable)..."".  This policy also requires, ""...The receiving hospital must give acceptance in advance.  The acceptance must be documented in the medical record; Patient gives written consent for transfer; The patient must be transferred by an appropriate medical transfer vehicle.  A patient may not be transferred in a private passenger vehicle unless the patient refuses to be transported by ambulance.  The patient's refusal must be in writing.  The physician will order appropriate medical personnel to attend the patient, maintain and/or initiate treatment or medications and manage known potential adverse affects...Copies of the medical record, x-rays and laboratory tests will accompany the patient when transferred..."".

2.  The hospital's policy, ""Treatment & Transfer"", revised 09/28/09, documents, ""...If the patient has an emergency medical condition the patient will be provided necessary medical treatment to stabilize the emergency medical condition, such that, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during a transfer to another facility or with respect to the pregnant woman in labor, the woman has delivered, including the placenta, or the physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner has determined the woman to be in false labor, or that the woman can be appropriately transferred...""  The policy also requires for unstable transfer, ""...The patient/responsible party must be made aware of the risks and benefits of transfer.  The patient/responsible party must consent in writing by signing the Authorization for transfer form.  The reason for the request to transfer shall be documented on the Authorization for Transfer Form...The physician documents on the Authorization for Transfer Form the benefits and risks of transfer and certifies in writing the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks...The receiving facility must have available space and qualified personnel to treat the patient.  The patient's physician or designee must obtain acceptance...The patient's physician will determine the most appropriate mode of transportation based upon an individual assessment of the patient's needs.  Copied (sic) of currently available medical records must be sent with the patient...Other pertinent records not available at the time of the patient's transfer shall be sent to the receiving facility as soon as practicable after transfer.""

3.  For Patient #1, an appropriate medical screening examination was not conducted; for Patients #1 and #5, the hospital did not follow these policies and did not effect an appropriate transfer according to these policies and the regulations.

BASED ON REVIEW OF HOSPITAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, MEDICAL RECORDS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH HOSPITAL STAFF, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO ENFORCE ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF 42 CFR 489.24 BY NOT PROVIDING AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION FOR ONE (PATIENT #1) OF FIVE PREGNANT PATIENTS THOUGHT TO BE IN ACTIVE LABOR.  AND FOR TRANSFER OF TWO (PATIENTS #1 AND #5) OF SIX PATIENTS WHO HAD AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION (EMC) REQUIRING TRANSFER TO ANOTHER ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL, AND WHOSE MEDICAL RECORDS WERE REVIEWED.

Based on documentation reviewed in 1 of 1 ED document for a patient (Patient 25) who presented to the hospital's ED by ambulance and who was intubated and being ""bagged"" by ambulance personnel, review of hospital policies and procedures, and review of other documentation, it was determined the hospital failed to ensure a MSE was conducted for Patient 25 to determine whether or not the patient had an EMC. The findings reflected that the hospital staff had identified the failure to provide the MSE, had self-reported the failure to the State Agency on 03/24/2014, and had initiated steps to correct the failure, before this investigation was initiated on 03/31/2014. 

1. The hospital's Medical Staff Rules & Regulations, ""Last Revision October 10, 2012"" was reviewed. Page 36 reflected ""All patients who present to the hospital and who request examination and treatment for an emergency medical condition or active labor, shall be evaluated for the existence of an emergency medical condition, or where applicable, active labor by the Emergency Physician or Nurse Practitioner.""

2. Review of the hospital's ED policy titled, ""EMTALA Guidelines For Emergency Department Services"", effective ""4/08"" reflected the following internal requirements: ""All patients shall receive a medical screening exam...Medical Screening Exams should include at a minimum the following:
 
Emergency Department Log entry including disposition of the patient
Patient's triage record
Vital signs
History
Physical exam of affected systems and potentially affected systems
Exam of known chronic conditions
Necessary testing to rule out emergency medical conditions
Notification and use of oncall [sic] personnel to complete previously mentioned guidelines
Notification and use of oncall [sic] physicians to diagnose and/or stabilize the patient as necessary
Vital signs upon discharge or transfer
Complete documentation of the medical screening exam""

3. An ED document for Patient 25 was reviewed. The document was a one page ""emergency room    Note"", generated by Physician A with a ""Date of Visit: 02/24/2014"". The ""emergency room    Note"" was the only document provided by the hospital for the patient's 02/24/2014 ED visit. The ""Chief Complaint:"" section of the note reflected ""The patient is a [adult male/female] who presents to the emergency department intubated...On arrival here, the patient is intubated with a pulse. [Ambulance personnel] states that [he/she] was found collapsed. There was no history of trauma. [He/she] was in ventricular fibrillation, which they defibrillated [him/her] and restored a pulse. [He/she] was also intubated. On arrival here, [he/she] was still on the [ambulance gurney]...I felt that the patient required far more care than we would be able to give [him/her] at Southern Coos. Primarily, we have no ventilators and no ICU. No cardiologist. My feeling was that the patient would be much better served by being transferred to [another hospital], and I felt that any type of workup here would only delay definitive treatment...I also notified the ER  physician at [another hospital] regarding the patient's arrival. The patient again was loaded into the ambulance and transported up to [another hospital]. No chart was generated. The patient was not taken off the [ambulance gurney] and placed in a bed for any further exam, as again I felt that the primary place for this patient would be at [another hospital] and that any workup here or further examination would only delay definitive care. As noted, the patient is intubated. The patient was sent to [another hospital] in critical condition."" The ""Assessment"" section of the physician note reflected ""Status post cardiac arrest. The patient left in critical condition."" The record reflected the note was dictated 02/24/2014 at 1126 by Physician A, and transcribed 02/24/2014 at 1345. 

There was no documentation to reflect that a MSE was conducted to determine whether or not an EMC existed. There was no documentation of an ED log entry including disposition of the patient; a patient triage record; vital signs; a physical examination of affected systems and potentially affected systems; an examination of known chronic conditions; testing to rule out emergency medical conditions; vital signs upon discharge or transfer; or other documentation of a MSE in accordance with the hospital's policy. 

4. An interview was conducted with Physician A on 04/02/2014 at 1125. The physician stated he/she was on duty in the ED on 02/24/2014 when Patient 25 presented to the hospital. The physician stated the first thing he/she saw was ""the squad"" with a patient on a gurney. He/she identified ""the squad"" as two EMS personnel. The physician stated the patient was intubated and being ""bagged"" when the squad brought the patient into the ED. The physician stated the squad informed him/her that the patient collapsed in the field. The physician stated ""I checked the patient. [He/she] was ventilating. [He/she] had a strong pulse. The physician stated he/she checked the patient's ventilation by watching his/her chest rise. He/she stated that to unload and undress the patient would've just delayed treatment and stated ""I had frankly nothing more to offer [him/her]."" The physician stated he/she told the squad to take the patient up to another hospital (27 miles and 35 minutes driving time away according to mapquest.com). The physician stated if the identical situation occurred again the only thing he/she would do differently would be to fill out the paper work and transfer form and fax it over to the receiving hospital and stated ""That was my mistake"". 

During the interview, the physician stated that the 02/24/2014 ""emergency room    Note"" identified in finding 3. above reflected his/her MSE and history of the patient.  

5. An interview was conducted with an ED RN on 04/01/2014 at 1445. The RN stated he/she was on duty in the ED when Patient 25 (MDS) dated [DATE]. 

During the interview, the RN stated he/she was in a treatment room with another patient when Patient 25 was brought into the ED. The RN stated when he/she came out of the treatment room, he/she looked at the ED camera screen and saw a patient being wheeled out the hospital door on a gurney. He/she stated it looked like the patient was being ""bagged"" by EMS staff. The RN stated he/she asked Physician A where the patient was going and the physician stated ""Oh, don't worry about it. I took care of it. I sent them to [another hospital]"", and ""EMS came in with a patient who collapsed at home. They shocked [him/her] and [he/she] barely had a pulse."" The RN stated he/she told the physician, ""You can't do that"" and ""That's EMTALA."" The RN stated the physician told him/her ""I'm the doctor"" and stated that he/she had done a proper assessment of the patient. The RN stated he/she then called his/her manager and reported the incident.

6. An interview was conducted with a second RN on 04/01/2014 at 1400. The RN stated he/she was in the ED when Patient 25 (MDS) dated [DATE]. 

During the interview the RN stated that he/she observed the patient  wheeled into the ED just inside the ED doors. He/she stated Physician A started getting a verbal report from EMS and visually looked over the patient, but the RN stated he/she never saw the physician touch the patient. The RN stated the physician told EMS staff ""just keep going. Go up to [another hospital]."" The RN stated the EMS staff turned right around and put the patient back into the ambulance and left the ED. The RN stated that he/she had no knowledge of EMTALA ""laws"" and never received any EMTALA training from the hospital before the 02/24/2014 incident involving Patient 25.

THE FINDINGS REFLECTED THAT THE HOSPITAL STAFF HAD IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE MSE, HAD SELF-REPORTED THE FAILURE TO THE STATE AGENCY ON 03/24/2014, AND HAD INITIATED STEPS TO CORRECT THE FAILURE, BEFORE THIS INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED ON 03/31/2014. 

1. THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICAL STAFF RULES & REGULATIONS, ""LAST REVISION OCTOBER 10, 2012"" WAS REVIEWED. PAGE 36 REFLECTED ""ALL PATIENTS WHO PRESENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND WHO REQUEST EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT FOR AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION OR ACTIVE LABOR, SHALL BE EVALUATED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION, OR WHERE APPLICABLE, ACTIVE LABOR BY THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN OR NURSE PRACTITIONER.""

Based on interviews, documentation in 6 of 6 medical records reviewed of patients who were evaluated to have an EMC and were transferred or directed to other hospitals (Patients 1, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15), and review of policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that appropriate transfers of patients with EMCs were conducted. An appropriate transfer for Patient 1 was not conducted as a physician or a qualified medical person had not signed the required certification, the receiving hospital had not been contacted and agreed to accept the patient, medical records were not sent with the patient, appropriate transportation with qualified personnel was not used, and patient-specific risks of transfer were not identified. In addition, the risks of transfer were not patient-specific for Patients 11 through 15. 

Findings include:

1. *The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Emergency Treatment and Active labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities"", dated as last revised ""6/12"", was reviewed.  The policy required ""Transfers are made physician-to-physician...The patient may be transferred only when the receiving hospital or facility has consented to accept the patient...All pertinent medical information shall accompany the patient being transferred and the transfer shall be effected through qualified personnel and transfer equipment.""

The policy reflected ""Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) means...A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]...With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions...That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or ...That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child."" 

The procedure portion of the above document reflected ""Prior to transfer, an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient.  Risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and written on the Patient Transfer Form...Patients may be transferred (1) at their own request...or (3) if physician or qualified care provider certifies in writing that the benefits of transferring the patient to another facility outweigh the risk...Arrangements for proper conveyance will then be made...The evaluating care provider will place a call to the receiving care provider and health care facility. The necessary information will be relayed. The receiving facility must (1) be informed of the transfer and (2) agree to accept the patient, provide appropriate medical treatment and have space and qualified personnel available...The referring and receiving care providers share the responsibility for patient transfer and they should consult regarding the arrangements and details for patient transfer, including the method of transportation.  The care provider arranging transportation is responsible for determining what additional care is required before transfer, and what capabilities should be available en route (sic)...Accompanying records sent with patient...A 'Transfer form'... must be completed for each transfer...The nurse caring for patient is responsible for calling a nursing report to the receiving facility unit. Report should be documented in nurses' notes including name of nurse receiving report...Transfer summary should be completed and nursing goals addressed prior to transfer...Documentation to occur on patient's chart (1) Notification of acceptance by the receiving heath care facility (2) How patient is transferred (3) Records that accompanied the patient (4) Reasons for transfer... (5) Note by the physician of the patient's condition at the time of transfer (6) Notification of patient's family (7) Explanation of benefits and risks are explained to patient/family."" 

* The Professional Staff Policies and Procedures, dated as last revised 07/25/2014, were reviewed. These were part of the Professional Staff Bylaws and applied to MDs and other LIPs.  ""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 1.F. Medical Screening Examinations"" reflected that the professional staff had designated RNs with specified experience and qualifications as ""qualified medical personnel who may be permitted to perform medical screening examinations"" for OB patients.

""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 1.G. Against Medical Advice (AMA) Discharges"" reflected ""When the patient leaves the Hospital without an opportunity to be given an explanation of the risks of leaving, the medical record should include any attempts to explain the risks and to request that the patient sign a release form."" 

""Article XVII. Additional Policies, 2.K. Emergency Medical Record"" reflected ""If a patient is transferred to another facility, the transfer process shall be fully documented in the medical record.  If a patient leaves the Hospital against medical advice (AMA), this shall also be noted. A copy of the record of emergency services provided shall be communicated to the Member, practitioner or agency responsible for any follow-up care.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Perinatal Triage and Medical Screening Examination"", dated as last revised ""10/13"", was reviewed. The policy reflected ""Labor as defined by EMTALA, is the process of childbirth beginning with the latent phase of labor or early phase of labor and continuing through delivery of the placenta.  A woman experiencing contractions is in true labor unless a qualified medical person...certifies that after a reasonable time of observation the woman is in false labor.""

The policy included direction for a qualified Perinatal RN to conduct an initial evaluation of the patient and ""Following evaluation and communication between RN and LIP, the LIP will provide direction to admit, discharge, or transfer the patient.""

""Utilize the following guidelines if a patient...wishes to leave hospital:  Provider informs the patient of the risks and benefits of the examination and/or treatment...Document the description of the examination and treatment that was refused by the patient...Follow hospital procedure related to consent for leaving hospital against advice (i.e. Against Medical Advice release).""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Transfer of Maternal Perinatal Patient"", dated as last revised ""10/13"", was reviewed. The policy stipulated ""A patient who meets the criteria of an emergency medical condition may not be transferred until she is stabilized unless...The patient requests a transfer, in writing, after being informed of the hospital's obligations under the law and the risks of transfer...An LIP signs a written certification that based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or unborn child.""

The procedure included the following requirements for the RN: ""Notify appropriate LIP of initial assessment findings...In most cases, the LIP will complete an examination of the patient prior to transfer...Telephone orders authorizing transfer may be accepted based on clinical situation. LIP to evaluate patient prior to transfer as appropriate per clinical status. Telephone orders must be signed by physician as contemporaneously as possible...Explain to the patient, prior to transfer, the need for transfer and the alternatives to transfer.  Risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and written on the Patient Transfer form...Verify receiving facility can accept transfer and has the space and qualified personnel to treat the patient...Verify that transferring LIP has given SBARR to receiving LIP, and receiving LIP accepts the patient...The transferring LIP will maintain responsibility for the patient until patient arrives at the receiving facility...Provide nurse to nurse report to receiving facility and document transfer summary on EMR, and any appropriate paper forms.  Nurse caring for patient is responsible for this report.""  Under the procedure section for ""Transportation & Equipment"" the RN was directed to notify the nursing supervisor to arrange for transportation.  Under the procedure section for ""Forms  & Paperwork"" the RN was directed to ""Complete patient transfer form for each transfer...Print patient transfer summary from EMR...Copy of medical records not in EMR.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Trial of Labor After Cesarean Section"", dated as last approved ""4/14"", was reviewed. The policy statement was ""Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital [and three other named hospitals] do not offer a trial of labor after cesarean section delivery.""

The procedure reflected that ""Risk for uterine rupture in women with a previous uterine scar...increases...for women who proceed with a TOLAC after one cesarean delivery...LIP should be notified immediately after initial assessment of patient's presence on the maternity unit...Refer to procedures related to...Obstetric Emergencies...Initiate procedures for obstetric emergency and treatment of suspected fetal or maternal compromise...Anticipate need for hemorrhage management if patient has uterine rupture.""

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""The Plan for the Provision of Care Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital"", dated as last revised ""3/2014"", was reviewed. The policy reflected the hospital did not have a NICU.  Under the ""Scope of Service"" it reflected ""When critical care or specialty care, not available at PHRMH, is needed for newborn and pediatric patients, they will be transferred to a more comprehensive facility based on medical necessity and parent or guardian preference."" 

* The hospital policy and procedure titled ""Patient's Leaving ED Before Treatment is Completed"", dated as last revised ""7/2013"", was reviewed. The policy reflected ""AMA: When a patient refuses to complete a medical screening examination, or consent to recommended treatment or transfer, risks and benefits should be discussed and an Informed Consent to Refuse form signed...the LIP should explain to the patient in understandable terms the risks of refusal of treatment or transfer...The nurse or LIP should complete the Informed Consent to Refuse form...The RN should document the patient's condition and circumstances surrounding the refusal of treatment or transfer in the medical record.""

There was no documentation related to implementation of the ""plan to discharge to OHSU"", including but not limited to: a written or telephone physician's order for ""discharge to OHSU"", communications with the patient about the assessment and plan, instructions given, risks and benefits discussed, physician to physician communications with OHSU, whether medical records were sent, mode of transportation arranged, who accompanied the patient, and time of discharge.  In addition, there was no documentation to reflect that the patient refused an appropriate transfer.

A progress note electronically ""filed"" by an MD the following day on 09/29/2014 at 1615 reflected: ""Patient called answering service 5:34 am 9/28/2014 and descirbed (sic) loss of fluid and blood tinged mucous, subsequently urinated. [Patient's] birth plan is VBAC at OHSU, advised to stop at triage in Hood River on [patient's] way to Portland and confirm ROM prior to proceeding to Portland.  Per nurse at approximately 6:30 am FHT 150s, contractions Q 10-15 minutes, patient grossly ruptured, cervix 3/90/-2.  Instructed not to wait for amniosure (sic) confirmation but to go directly to OHSU for labor management as previously planned.  FHT reviewed 150s.""  There was no other documentation by the MD prior to or after that note.

* The patient's pre-natal OB records from a clinic in Hood River were provided and reviewed.  Those reflected the patient's estimated date of delivery between 10/26/2014 and 11/04/2014.  The patient's documented history included a prior C-section ""due to breech"", and other risk factors such as a congenital single kidney, pre-diabetes, and obesity.  

* Mapquest reflects OHSU in Portland, Oregon is 65 miles and one hour and 11 minutes drive time from PHRMH in Hood River, Oregon.

* On 10/03/2014 at approximately 1330 the Associate Administrator of Patient Services and the Quality Management Coordinator were interviewed. They reported that on 09/29/2014 the PHRMH FBC Manager received an inquiry about Patient 1 who had presented to OHSU on 09/28/2014 in the a.m. where he/she delivered a newborn after arrival to that hospital. The Associate Administrator and Quality Coordinator reported that PHRMH staff started an investigation immediately and found that on 09/28/2014 at 0534 Patient 1 called his/her physician in Hood River with reports of loss of fluid and blood tinged mucus.  The physician directed Patient 1 to go the PHRMH for a ""labor check"" before driving to OHSU for a VBAC.  Patient 1 had an established birth plan to have a VBAC at OHSU as PHRMH does not provide VBAC by policy.  

The Associate Administrator and Quality Coordinator stated that medical staff bylaws permit a FBC RN to conduct the MSE for pregnant women.  They reported that Patient 1 arrived at PHRMH at 0610 and was checked by the FBC RN.  The RN assessed the patient to be 3 cm. dilated, 90% effaced, -2 station, with ruptured membranes, and FHTs in the 150s for ""3 to 4 mins"". During the time in the FBC the patient was requesting to leave the hospital to go to OHSU, was ""wanting to go AMA"". The RN called the physician who directed the RN to send Patient 1 to OHSU for the planned VBAC. Patient 1 left the hospital with his/her spouse in a private vehicle.  

During the interview it was confirmed that an appropriate transfer ""didn't happen"" as there was ""no MD to patient communication...no hospital to hospital communication...no RN to RN communication...nor did the RN complete transfer forms.""  They further reported that although Patient 1 was ""wanting to go AMA"", the patient was not presented with AMA forms to sign and there was no related documentation in Patient 1's medical record.

* The RN who cared for Patient 1 in the hospital's FBC on 09/28/2014 was interviewed on 10/03/2014 at 1610.  He/she stated that at 0600 (on 09/28/2014) he/she received a phone call from the MD who provided notice that Patient 1 was coming to the hospital. The RN related that the MD reported that his/her patient was coming in to the FBC to rule out ROM, and that the patient had a history of previous C-section and had a birth plan to have a VBAC at OHSU.  The MD provided orders for an Amnisure test and instructed the RN to call MD with result.

The RN stated that upon arrival at FBC the patient stated ""Can we make this quick"" and ""the baby is moving"".  The patient reported ""contractions every 15 minutes"" and stated that he/she wanted to go to OHSU.  The RN stated that he/she checked the patient's cervix, which was at 3 cm., and obtained a specimen for the Amnisure test. After the exam the patient was anxious to leave and asked if he/she could get dressed.  The RN stated that after the patient was dressed the RN observed the patient's pants were ""soaked"", and based on the smell and amount assessed the patient to have ""grossly ruptured"" membranes.  The RN reported that he/she contacted the MD by phone who directed the RN to ""discharge"" the patient to OHSU and ""send with a piece of paper"" to let OHSU know that the patient was ""grossly ruptured."" The RN reported he/she wrote on a ""sticky note"" the words ""grossly ruptured"" and the vaginal exam results of ""3 90% -2"".  The RN reported he/she gave the ""sticky note"" to the patient with instructions to give it to the staff at OHSU. The patient left the FBC at 0625 with his/her significant other who was at the bedside during the FBC visit. 

During the interview the RN stated that the patient wanted the FBC visit to be quick and that the patient ""did not want to be stuck in Hood River and wanted to be on [his/her] way to OHSU for the VBAC.""  The RN stated the patient was ""glad to be getting out of here.""  The RN confirmed that the only documentation sent with the patient was the ""sticky note"" and that no medical records were sent.  

During the interview the RN described an appropriate EMTALA transfer.  He/she stated that based on the RN assessment findings the physician would come in to the hospital to further evaluate the patient; the physician would call the other hospital to find out if the other hospital could accept the patient; there would have to be an RN to RN report; medical records would be printed and sent with the patient, including pre-natal records and labs; there would be an ambulance transport and the house supervisor would be contacted to help make those arrangements; and the appropriate transfer forms and documentation would have to be completed.  

3. The medical record of Patient 11 was reviewed. The ""Patient Demographics"" section of the record reflected that the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2005 with a chief complaint of ""Weakness, Dehydrated.""

The patient had been on TPN until 08/28/2014 and was continuing to receive wound treatments three times a week. As a result of a MSE conducted by an MD the patient was determined to have a bowel obstruction.

Patient 11 was transferred to OHSU on 09/06/2014 at 0045. Documentation on the electronic transfer form reflected that all aspects of an appropriate transfer were carried out except that the risks of the transfer were not individualized or patient specific. The risks were recorded as ""All transfers have the risk of traffic accidents, bad weather and/or road conditions as well as limitations of personnel and equipment during transport.  There is also potential for worsening of medical condition during transport resulting in possible disability and/or death...no other risks beyond those listed above are anticipated.""

1) An interview was conducted with EMP2 on April 4, 2013, at 9:40 AM.  EMP2 stated ""I was the Administrator On Call.  I received a call at 2:30 in the morning from nursing. ... that the physician scheduled to come in that day at 7:00 AM, had called in ill, that the physician was unable to work.  I directed the nursing staff to call ... our contracted company. Our Medical Director was out of the country and OTH16 was covering for him. The nursing staff contacted DRMC (DuBois Regional Medical Center) to call OTH16 who was covering.  The current ED physician that was here, was on a twenty-four hour shift, and [their] shift was up at 7:00 AM.  It was the physician that was replacing [them] at 7:00 AM, that called off.  OTH6 ... from DRMC called and advised the physician in the ED that [they] could not stay, that it was unsafe ... We contacted several other physicians at that time, and could not get anyone to come in ...  I can tell you that we do not have a formalized process in place for when this occurs.  So on this day we did not have a physician in the Emergency Department from 7:00 AM to 11:43 AM.""  
2)  An interview was conducted with EMP3 on April 4, 2013, at 9:50 AM.  EMP3 was queried to events that occurred on March 30, 2013.  EMP3 stated ""...I wasn't here when there was no physician coverage but was when the doctor called in sick.  The Clinical Care Coordinator (kind of like a supervisor) called the Administrator on call, EMP2.  EMP6 took the call from the doctor.  EMP6 called DuBois Regional Medical Center (DRMC).  At six AM, the shift was still not covered.  I absolutely saw a problem with this ... A couple of weeks ago we had this almost happen again.  It was a near miss.  OTH30 came in ...

We were all very nervous about the situation.  We didn't have a lot of patients and the ones we did were low level, fours or fives.  We were on the phone all morning trying to find coverage ... We never said we would not treat, but that we would help them find care.  We told them that we would bring them in and take vital signs, triage, and make them comfortable on a limited basis.  We told them that due to circumstances beyond our control, we can't have a doctor see you now.  At that point people weren't interested in much else.  There was no way they wanted to stay if there was no doctor.  People didn't have any interest in coming through the doors, once they knew we didn't have a doctor ... .""

INTERVIEWS:

Compliance Officer:
During an interview on 07/11/2013 at 9:36 a.m. with facility's Compliance Officer, she stated that in general she gets a report on all patients who visit the facility's emergency department, who left without being seen, left against medical advice and all patients medically screened, to determine the appropriateness of the medical screen. She said on 06/24/2013 she reviewed the record of Patient #1 and at that time she made a determination that the patient was not triaged or medically screened on her visit to the facility's emergency department. She then self-reported the findings to the State Agency.

She said the patient returned to the facility the following morning after the incident and was medically screened and treated by a physician. 

Clinical Director of emergency room   :
During an interview on 07/11/2013 at 1:10 p.m. with the facility's Emergency Department  Clinical Director revealed she became aware that the patient was present in the emergency room    on [DATE]. She said the registered nurse who was assigned to the patient called her at home via the telephone and informed her that there was a minor present in the emergency room    with presenting symptom of vaginal pain. The Registered Nurse informed her that there was no parent present but there was a young man who the patient claimed was her brother and that she lived with him. The nurse told her that the young man did not have any form of identification and that she had no way of proving that it was the patient's brother. The Clinical Director said she instructed the Registered Nurse assigned to the patient to go ahead and triage the patient, put her in a room and have the physician do a medical screen on the patient.

She said the following day when she arrived at the facility she reviewed Patient #1's clinical record and at that time she became aware that the patient was not triaged or provided with a medical screen. The Clinical Director said she placed a call to the patient at home and requested her to come back to the facility. 

The Clinical Director said she had a meeting with the Registered Nurse who was assigned to the patient. She was told by the nurse that she did not triage the patient because there was no parental consent. 

The Clinical Director said she has not had a formal in-service with the emergency room    staff but that she met with staff in groups and discussed the scenario. 

Registered Nurse (A):
During an interview on 07/12/13 at 8:17 a.m. with Registered Nurse (A) who was the registered nurse assigned to Patient #1 on 06/23/2013 when she presented to the facility's emergency department, revealed the following: Registered Nurse (A) said on the night of  Patient #1's visit to the facility's emergency department she was one of the nurses on duty. She said the registration clerk notified her that she had registered a [AGE] year old minor but there was no parent available for consent. Registered Nurse (A) said she did not know what to do but she brought the patient into the triage area and at that time told her that she needed a parent to treat her. She said Patient #1 told her that she lived with her brother. The patient then left the room and returned with two young men, one of whom she identified as her brother. The young man did not have any form of identification. She then asked her for her mother's telephone number, since she needed her mother's permission to treat her. The patient told her she did not know her mother's telephone number. Registered Nurse (A) said she asked the patient if she was bleeding or pregnant and the patient told her no. Registered Nurse (A) stated ""I just thought without a parent's consent we could not treat her.""

During the interview the Surveyor asked Registered Nurse (A) if she had been in-serviced on the EMTALA rules and the requirements for medical screening. Registered Nurse (A) said she was in-serviced by the facility on the EMTALA rules but she could not recall when she received the in-service. She stated ""Anybody that comes to the emergency department has to be medically screened.""

Registered Nurse (A) said she called her Nursing Director at home and the Nursing Director instructed her to triage the patient. She said she spoke to the patient but she did not triage the patient, did not obtain vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) on the patient. She said she did not assess the patient's pain level and on a scale of 0-10 she was not aware of the patient's pain level during her visit to the emergency department..

The Surveyor asked Registered Nurse (A)  if a medical screen was performed on the patient. She said there was no medical screen done on the patient. She said the physician on duty was present in the emergency department but she cannot recall if the physician was aware that the patient was present in the emergency department.

ER Medical Doctor:
On 07/12/2013 at 10.10 a.m. during interview with the facility's Medical Doctor revealed he was on duty on 06/23/2013 when Patient #1 presented to the emergency department. He said he did not actually make contact with the patient, but heard and was informed by the nurse that there was a [AGE] year old minor present with pelvic pain. He said the facility staff told him that facility staff were trying to make contact with one of her parents to obtain consent for treatment.  

He said while having a conversation with the registration clerk he caught a glimpse of the patient leaving the facility. He said he thought the patient left because of sheer frustration of not being able to contact her parent. The Medical Doctor said he was never asked by facility staff to conduct a medical screen on the patient. He said generally all patients are taken to the triage area and once the patient is triaged, then he is requested to perform a medical screen on the patient.

Based on interview, record review, and review of hospital policies and procedures and medical staff bylaws, the hospital failed to 1) ensure that the hospital's medical staff bylaws identified the qualifications of physicians, mid-level providers, and registered nurses who performed medical screening examinations (MSE) in the hospital's emergency department and obstetrical unit; and 2) ensure that a qualified health care provider performed a MSE for Patient #1.

Failure to ensure patients receive a comprehensive medical screening examination by a qualified medical professional and stabilizing treatment prior to transfer or discharge risks poor health care outcomes, injury, and death.

Reference:  42 CFR 482.55(b)(2) - ""The hospital must staff the emergency department with the appropriate numbers and types of professionals and other staff who possess the skills, education, certifications, specialized training and experience in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.""

Findings included:

1. Review of the hospital's medical staff bylaws showed they did not identify the qualifications of physicians, mid-level providers, and registered nurses who performed MSE's in the hospital's emergency department and obstetrical (OB) unit.

2. Review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Anti-Dumping Policy,"" Policy #1458 dated 05/24/19, showed that a MSE would be performed by a ""Qualified Provider."" The policy defined a ""Qualified Provider"" as a doctor of medicine or osteopathy; a certified nurse midwife with medical staff privileges that included OB care; and a registered nurse with two or more years' experience as a labor and delivery nurse and basic life support and neonatal resuscitation program certification. These qualifications were not included in the medical staff bylaws.

3. On 10/22/19 at 8:45 AM, the emergency department (ED) charge nurse stated physician assistants routinely provided emergency care to patients. The policy above did not identify a physician assistant as a ""Qualified Provider.""

4. Review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled ""Care of OB Triage Patients,"" Policy #6246 dated 05/15/19, showed that ""Qualified Medical Personnel"" would perform a MSE of obstetric patients at 20 weeks or greater gestation. The policy defined ""Qualified Medical Personnel"" as meeting the following requirements: Validation of labor and delivery unit competencies, as evidenced by completion of the orientation checklist and annual competency assessment; satisfactory completion of initial and annual job performance evaluation; successful completion of the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses intermediate fetal monitoring course; successful completion of unit-based education on EMTALA; and validation of MSE competency by the hospital educator and/or OB/GYN medical staff chair. These qualifications differed from the qualifications identified in Policy #1458 and were not included in the medical staff bylaws.

5. Review of the medical records for Patient #1 showed that a registered nurse (Staff #3) performed a MSE of Patient #1 in the hospital's obstetric unit on 09/16/19. There was no evidence in the record of another nurse or physician participating in the MSE.

6. On 10/23/19 at 3:10 PM during an interview with the investigator, the nursing director for the hospital's obstetric unit (Staff #5) stated that Staff #3 was currently in orientation.

7. Review of Staff #3's orientation checklist and personnel file on 10/23/19 showed she had been hired on 07/22/19. The nurse did not meet the requirements for ""Qualified Provider"" as defined in Policy #1458 nor ""Qualified Medical Personnel"" as defined in Policy #6246.

Based on interviews, review of medical records and review of documents, the hospital failed to identify the appropriate transfer forms that were to be completed by staff and sent with each transferred patient for 6 of 9 patients (Patients #6, #7, #16, #19, #21 and #23) transferred.

Failure to identify required transfer forms for transferred patients places patients at risk for unmet care needs and results in incomplete documentation.

Findings included:

1. Record review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled, ""EMTALA/Patient Transfers,"" last reviewed date 03/08/18, did not show guidance regarding which forms were required to be completed when patients were transferred.

2. Record review of the hospital's policy and procedure titled, ""COBRA/EMTALA,"" reviewed 04/03/19, did not show guidance regarding which forms were required.

Based on review of facility policies and procedures, medical records (MR), and interview with staff, it was determined the facility failed to ensure:

1. The staff implemented steps to prevent a patient(s) with Suicidal Ideation (SI) from leaving prior to receiving stabilizing treatment, including placement of the patient(s) in a safe environment area, initiation of 1:1 observation and/or constant observation, and documenting every 15 minute observations of the patient(s) behavior per the facility policy, including Patient Identifier (PI) # 11 and PI # 15 

2. A patient having hallucinations was re-evaluated for the dangerousness of the hallucinations and the family was apprised of the risks and benefits of leaving given the patient's hallucinations, including PI # 18. 

This deficient practice affected 3 of 23 MR's reviewed and had the potential to affect all patients treated at this facility.

Based on reviews of medical records, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) / Ambulance Report, Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) related Policies and Procedures and Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, and interviews, it was determined Jackson Hospital (Hospital # 1) failed to arrange an appropriate transfer of Patient Identifier (PI) # 1 and PI # 9, two patients determined to be a danger to self and/or others, by failing to arrange transfer after the Emergency Medical Screening was completed and the need for inpatient psychiatric treatment was identified, thereby, delaying stabilizing treatment for both PI # 1 and PI # 9. 

As a result of this deficient practice, PI # 1's and PI # 9's psychiatric treatment was delayed. This deficient practice affected PI # 1 and PI # 9, two of 29 sampled patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), and has the potential to affect all patients with emergency psychiatric conditions who present to the ED at Hospital # 1 and require transfer to another hospital for inpatient psychiatric treatment.

Interviews - Hospital # 1:

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 14:27, the Emergency Department (ED) Case Manager (CM) / Resource Management, Employee Identifier (EI ) # 1, stated if a psychiatric patient is committed by the court, placement is pre-determined by the Probate Judge and the patient is medically cleared, the patient is discharged    from the ED to the custody of the sheriff for transport. When a patient is court ordered to treatment at Hospital # 2, Hospital # 1 does not complete a consent for transfer form.  

Regarding PI # 1, the ED CM said prior to the court commitment of PI # 1, she tried to find an appropriate hospital to accept PI # 1. Mental Health staff (non hospital employees) come to the ED to evaluate psychiatric patients at the request of Jackson Hospital. 

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 16:55, EI # 1, ED Case Manager (CM) stated when PI # 1 presented to the ED, the patient did not have a court petition. According to the CM, she spoke with (name of psychiatrist) at Hospital # 3, but he would not accept PI # 1 without a court petition. While the CM continued to find another hospital to accept the patient, she was informed by Probate Court that a petition had been filed for PI # 1. The CM received a call from the Sheriff's office advising they were coming to transport the patient to Hospital # 2. The CM stated Hospital # 1 does not consider a patient court ordered to treatment a transfer because the court makes arrangements to include ascertaining bed availability at the receiving facility, not the hospital. Hospital # 1 considers the patient as a discharge and they do not talk to the receiving physician or staff at the receiving facility. According to the CM, PI # 1's consent for transfer form was completed in error. PI # 1's disposition was considered a discharge of a probate court ordered/committed patient who was medically cleared. The CM said PI # 1 was not a transfer. Review of  PI#1 ' s Consent to Transfer Form dated 3/10/2015 revealed that PI#1 was transferred and not discharged   .

During an interview on 3/18/15 at 16:45, the ED Physician (EI # 2) who signed the Consent and Transfer Form for PI # 1 on 3/10/15, confirmed the accepting psychiatrist as the receiving physician at Hospital # 2. Regarding patients with court orders for treatment the physician said, ""We (Jackson Hospital) don't know where the patient is going. We haven't made the arrangements.""  

According to the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, ""The condition of all injured persons presenting to the Emergency Department of the hospital shall be determined and the patient ...referred to an appropriate facility as indicated. Appropriate transfer agreements must be confirmed with the receiving facility and practitioner prior to transfer.""

During an interview on 3/19/15 at 10:00, EI # 1, ED Case Manager, said if a patient has a court petition, the judge determines where the patient will be sent for treatment. ""We (Jackson Hospital) don't have an accepting MD. The patient is discharged    from the ED. We are following the judge's order.""  

During an interview on 3/10/15 at 11:00, the ED Charge Nurse (EI # 6) stated PI # 1 was court ordered to treatment at Hospital # 2. According to the charge nurse, the sheriffs who came to the ED to transport PI # 1, said the patient refused to get in their van and insisted that EI # 6 call an ambulance to transport the patient. 

The Charge Nurse stated, ""I don't call the hospital because (name of case manager) takes care of that."" The nurse said the RN assigned to PI # 1 ""attempted"" to call report about the patient to the charge nurse at Hospital # 2.  EI # 1 said she did not know the outcome of that call. However, the charge nurse said she received a call from from the charge nurse at Hospital # 2 and gave report about PI # 1. This communication is not documented in PI # 1's medical record. 

During an interview on 3/19/15 at 17:00, the ED Physician, EI # 3, responsible for PI # 1's medical screening examination on 3/10/15, stated because PI # 1 was admitted     after 17:00 the mental health evaluation was not done until the following morning. When asked if he spoke with the psychiatrist documented on the transfer consent form as the receiving MD at Hospital # 2 he said, ""Probably. I usually do."" 

During an interview on 3/20/15 at 10:25, the Assistant ED Manager (EI # 4) and the ED Manager (EI # 5) verified that no consent transfer form is required when a patient is court ordered to treatment at another hospital. The patient is discharged    to the custody of the sheriff responsible for transporting the patient. The use of the Consent and Transfer Form to transfer of PI # 1 to Hospital # 2 on 3/10 15 was a ""mistake."" According to the managers, there is no contact by Jackson Hospital with the MD at the receiving hospital because probate court arranges the transfer. 

Summary, PI # 1 arrived in the ED at Hospital # 1 on 3/10/15 at 00:32.  Although the ED physician determined the patient was ""cleared medically for psychiatric referral"" at 03:10, no arrangements were documented and/or made to transfer PI # 1 to a psychiatric facility. Although the ED physician responsible for PI # 1's medical screening documented the patient's care was transferred to (name of psychiatrist), no physician to physician communication is documented in the medical record as required according to Hospital # 1's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. The mental health evaluation was documented at 08:45, more than eight hours after the medical screening evaluation was completed and the need for psychiatric treatment was identified. Over sixteen hours after arrival at Hospital # 1, PI # 1 was transported to Hospital # 2, representing an inappropriate transfer and a significant delay prior to the transfer of this patient identified as high risk by Hospital # 1's ED staff.  
 

2. PI # 9 - Jackson Hospital (Hospital # 1):

PI # 9 arrived at Hospital # 1's Emergency Department (ED) via private vehicle on 3/15/2015 at 18:45. According to the Triage Report at 18:57, PI # 9 complained of visual hallucinations for one week.  

Vital Signs: Blood Pressure 169/80, Pulse 100, Respirations: 20.

3/16/2015 at 05:30: ""...Awaiting psych.""   

3/16/2015 at 09:00: ""... (name of local Mental Health staff) in to see.""

3/16/15 at 13:16: ""... Pt. (PI # 9) aware of pending transport to (Mental Health facility).""   

3/16/15 at 13:45: Disposition: Transfer. ""Escorted to (Mental Health Facility) per...Sheriff.""

Psychiatric Problems: Depression, Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.

Patient is harm to others.

Disposition: Transfer.  

Condition: Improved. Stable. This is a certified medical emergency.  

Resource Management Note for PI # 9 dated 3/16/1015 at 09:42:

Pt. (PI #9) was evaluated by (Named Area Mental Health Authority) and it was determined inpatient psychiatric treatment needed, but patient unwilling to go for treatment. Mental Health Authority to petition probate court for involuntary commitment.  

Petition for Involuntary Commitment : 

PI # 9 has a history of psychiatric treatment with Named Mental Health Authority ... and has a previous diagnosis of Schizophrenic Disorder, Schizo-Affective Disorder, Schizo Affective Type. PI # 9 is currently at Jackson Hospital ER  (emergency room   ) and is refusing inpatient treatment...has delusional thinking regarding high school boys who are trying to fight (him/her). Has had very aggressive behavior at home, is preoccupied, disoriented to time and day and is seeing faces of people who are not there. The petitioner believes PI # 9 is a threat to self and others and is in need of treatment for stabilization. Without treatment PI # 9's condition will continue to worsen.    

In summary, PI # 9 received a Medical Screening Examination on 3/13/15 at 19:07 at Jackson Hospital's ED. The Physician determined the patient was psychotic and was a danger to others. There are no psychiatric services at Jackson Hospital. PI # 9 was evaluated by an outside psychiatric provider (Named Medial Health Authority - MAMHA) on 3/16/15 at 9:26 AM, fourteen hours and 26 minutes after the ED Physician determined the patient was a harm to others and ordered a psychiatric evaluation. Transfer of PI # 9 from the ED to (Mental Health facility) occurred on 3/16/15 at 13:45, 18 hours and 26 minutes after the Medical Screening Examination (MSE). This represents an inappropriate transfer and a significant delay prior to the transfer of PI # 9, a patient identified as a risk to harm others by Hospital # 1's ED staff.

The hospital failed to ensure their procedure titled, ""Transfer of an Unstable Patient to Another Facility after a MSE (Medical Screening Examination) was followed for PI # 9 on 3/15/2015 as evidenced by failing to:
1). Ensure the physician completed an Authorization and Consent for Patient Transfer Form (physician written certification for transfer).
2). Contact, confirm and document the receiving physician agreed to accept transfer of the patient (PI # 9); and
3). A report was given to the receiving hospital using the Authorization and Consent for Patient Transfer form.

INTERVIEWS - HOSPITAL # 1:

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/18/15 AT 14:27, THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) CASE MANAGER (CM) / RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEE IDENTIFIER (EI ) # 1, STATED IF A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT IS COMMITTED BY THE COURT, PLACEMENT IS PRE-DETERMINED BY THE PROBATE JUDGE AND THE PATIENT IS MEDICALLY CLEARED, THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED    FROM THE ED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF FOR TRANSPORT. WHEN A PATIENT IS COURT ORDERED TO TREATMENT AT HOSPITAL # 2, HOSPITAL # 1 DOES NOT COMPLETE A CONSENT FOR TRANSFER FORM.  

REGARDING PI # 1, THE ED CM SAID PRIOR TO THE COURT COMMITMENT OF PI # 1, SHE TRIED TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE HOSPITAL TO ACCEPT PI # 1. MENTAL HEALTH STAFF (NON HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES) COME TO THE ED TO EVALUATE PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS AT THE REQUEST OF JACKSON HOSPITAL. 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/18/15 AT 16:55, EI # 1, ED CASE MANAGER (CM) STATED WHEN PI # 1 PRESENTED TO THE ED, THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE A COURT PETITION. ACCORDING TO THE CM, SHE SPOKE WITH (NAME OF PSYCHIATRIST) AT HOSPITAL # 3, BUT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT PI # 1 WITHOUT A COURT PETITION. WHILE THE CM CONTINUED TO FIND ANOTHER HOSPITAL TO ACCEPT THE PATIENT, SHE WAS INFORMED BY PROBATE COURT THAT A PETITION HAD BEEN FILED FOR PI # 1. THE CM RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE ADVISING THEY WERE COMING TO TRANSPORT THE PATIENT TO HOSPITAL # 2. THE CM STATED HOSPITAL # 1 DOES NOT CONSIDER A PATIENT COURT ORDERED TO TREATMENT A TRANSFER BECAUSE THE COURT MAKES ARRANGEMENTS TO INCLUDE ASCERTAINING BED AVAILABILITY AT THE RECEIVING FACILITY, NOT THE HOSPITAL. HOSPITAL # 1 CONSIDERS THE PATIENT AS A DISCHARGE AND THEY DO NOT TALK TO THE RECEIVING PHYSICIAN OR STAFF AT THE RECEIVING FACILITY. ACCORDING TO THE CM, PI # 1'S CONSENT FOR TRANSFER FORM WAS COMPLETED IN ERROR. PI # 1'S DISPOSITION WAS CONSIDERED A DISCHARGE OF A PROBATE COURT ORDERED/COMMITTED PATIENT WHO WAS MEDICALLY CLEARED. THE CM SAID PI # 1 WAS NOT A TRANSFER. REVIEW OF  PI#1 ' S CONSENT TO TRANSFER FORM DATED 3/10/2015 REVEALED THAT PI#1 WAS TRANSFERRED AND NOT DISCHARGED   .

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/18/15 AT 16:45, THE ED PHYSICIAN (EI # 2) WHO SIGNED THE CONSENT AND TRANSFER FORM FOR PI # 1 ON 3/10/15, CONFIRMED THE ACCEPTING PSYCHIATRIST AS THE RECEIVING PHYSICIAN AT HOSPITAL # 2. REGARDING PATIENTS WITH COURT ORDERS FOR TREATMENT THE PHYSICIAN SAID, ""WE (JACKSON HOSPITAL) DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PATIENT IS GOING. WE HAVEN'T MADE THE ARRANGEMENTS.""  

ACCORDING TO THE FACILITY'S MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATIONS, ""THE CONDITION OF ALL INJURED PERSONS PRESENTING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL SHALL BE DETERMINED AND THE PATIENT ...REFERRED TO AN APPROPRIATE FACILITY AS INDICATED. APPROPRIATE TRANSFER AGREEMENTS MUST BE CONFIRMED WITH THE RECEIVING FACILITY AND PRACTITIONER PRIOR TO TRANSFER.""

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/19/15 AT 10:00, EI # 1, ED CASE MANAGER, SAID IF A PATIENT HAS A COURT PETITION, THE JUDGE DETERMINES WHERE THE PATIENT WILL BE SENT FOR TREATMENT. ""WE (JACKSON HOSPITAL) DON'T HAVE AN ACCEPTING MD. THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED    FROM THE ED. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE JUDGE'S ORDER.""  

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/10/15 AT 11:00, THE ED CHARGE NURSE (EI # 6) STATED PI # 1 WAS COURT ORDERED TO TREATMENT AT HOSPITAL # 2. ACCORDING TO THE CHARGE NURSE, THE SHERIFFS WHO CAME TO THE ED TO TRANSPORT PI # 1, SAID THE PATIENT REFUSED TO GET IN THEIR VAN AND INSISTED THAT EI # 6 CALL AN AMBULANCE TO TRANSPORT THE PATIENT. 

THE CHARGE NURSE STATED, ""I DON'T CALL THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE (NAME OF CASE MANAGER) TAKES CARE OF THAT."" THE NURSE SAID THE RN ASSIGNED TO PI # 1 ""ATTEMPTED"" TO CALL REPORT ABOUT THE PATIENT TO THE CHARGE NURSE AT HOSPITAL # 2.  EI # 1 SAID SHE DID NOT KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THAT CALL. HOWEVER, THE CHARGE NURSE SAID SHE RECEIVED A CALL FROM FROM THE CHARGE NURSE AT HOSPITAL # 2 AND GAVE REPORT ABOUT PI # 1. THIS COMMUNICATION IS NOT DOCUMENTED IN PI # 1'S MEDICAL RECORD. 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/19/15 AT 17:00, THE ED PHYSICIAN, EI # 3, RESPONSIBLE FOR PI # 1'S MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION ON 3/10/15, STATED BECAUSE PI # 1 WAS ADMITTED     AFTER 17:00 THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION WAS NOT DONE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING. WHEN ASKED IF HE SPOKE WITH THE PSYCHIATRIST DOCUMENTED ON THE TRANSFER CONSENT FORM AS THE RECEIVING MD AT HOSPITAL # 2 HE SAID, ""PROBABLY. I USUALLY DO."" 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 3/20/15 AT 10:25, THE ASSISTANT ED MANAGER (EI # 4) AND THE ED MANAGER (EI # 5) VERIFIED THAT NO CONSENT TRANSFER FORM IS REQUIRED WHEN A PATIENT IS COURT ORDERED TO TREATMENT AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL. THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED    TO THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING THE PATIENT. THE USE OF THE CONSENT AND TRANSFER FORM TO TRANSFER OF PI # 1 TO HOSPITAL # 2 ON 3/10 15 WAS A ""MISTAKE."" ACCORDING TO THE MANAGERS, THERE IS NO CONTACT BY JACKSON HOSPITAL WITH THE MD AT THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL BECAUSE PROBATE COURT ARRANGES THE TRANSFER. 

SUMMARY, PI # 1 ARRIVED IN THE ED AT HOSPITAL # 1 ON 3/10/15 AT 00:32.  ALTHOUGH THE ED PHYSICIAN DETERMINED THE PATIENT WAS ""CLEARED MEDICALLY FOR PSYCHIATRIC REFERRAL"" AT 03:10, NO ARRANGEMENTS WERE DOCUMENTED AND/OR MADE TO TRANSFER PI # 1 TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. ALTHOUGH THE ED PHYSICIAN RESPONSIBLE FOR PI # 1'S MEDICAL SCREENING DOCUMENTED THE PATIENT'S CARE WAS TRANSFERRED TO (NAME OF PSYCHIATRIST), NO PHYSICIAN TO PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION IS DOCUMENTED IN THE MEDICAL RECORD AS REQUIRED ACCORDING TO HOSPITAL # 1'S MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION WAS DOCUMENTED AT 08:45, MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE MEDICAL SCREENING EVALUATION WAS COMPLETED AND THE NEED FOR PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT WAS IDENTIFIED. OVER SIXTEEN HOURS AFTER ARRIVAL AT HOSPITAL # 1, PI # 1 WAS TRANSPORTED TO HOSPITAL # 2, REPRESENTING AN INAPPROPRIATE TRANSFER AND A SIGNIFICANT DELAY PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER OF THIS PATIENT IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK BY HOSPITAL # 1'S ED STAFF.

Based on interviews, medical record reviews and review of Hospital and EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) Policies and Procedures, emergency room    Policy and procedures, Bylaws/Rules and Regulations, Hospital # 1 failed to:

A. Ensure an appropriate Medical Screening Examination (MSE) was provided to Patient Identifier (PI #1), a preterm pregnant female who presented to the emergency room    with cramping and bleeding on 6/12/2017, to determine if an Emergency Medical Condition existed. Refer to findings at A 2406. 

B. Failed to provide stabilizing treatment for PI # 1 on 6/12/2017, when Hospital # 1 had the capacity and capability to provide treatment.  
Refer to findings at A 2407.

C. Prevent the inappropriate transfer of PI # 1, a patient who required further evaluation and treatment to stabilize her EMC (Emergency Medical Condition), to Hospital # 2.  Because the hospital failed to triage and screen PI # 1, an appropriate transfer was not arranged. Refer to findings at A 2409. 

This deficient practice effected PI #1, one of 32 ED (Emergency Department) sampled patients and had the potential to negatively affect other patients who present to Hospital #1's Emergency Department with similar obstetrical symptoms.

Stated she was not looked at when at arrowhead (sic). (Receiving hospital's-name of the Risk Management) stated patient due date was 10/4/2018 and she delivered at (name of the receiving hospital). Drove herself there from Arrowhead....""

During the Labor and Delivery (L & D) Unit-tour on 11/27/2018 and 11/28/2018, the surveyors observed the L & D Intake Department. All the patients presenting at the Intake Department were required to complete a hospital form titled 'OB Triage/Medical Screening' Form.

OB Triage /Medical Screening Form requires the pt. to complete the following:
""...Date; Time; Legal Name; Date of Birth (DOB); Social Security #; Home Phone #; Current Address; Have you been to an Abrazo Hospital before? OB Doctor; Due Date; Date of last period; Reason for visit today....""
 
The form also includes: ""...FOR YOUR SAFETY AND TO VERIFY PATIENT IDENTIFY: (sic) PLEASE PROVIDE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION AND INSURANCE CARDS WITH THIS FORM...If you have a Medical Emergency or are in Labor, you have the right to receive a Medical Screening Examination and necessary Stabilizing treatment/transfer, even if you cannot pay or do not have medical insurance...."" 

Employee #7 confirmed during an interview on 11/27/2018, that s/he remembered this case. S/he reported that every pt. is required to fill out the OB Triage /Medical Screening Form with name, DOB and reason for visit. Employee #7 stated, if the pt. cannot fill the form out, s/he would help them fill out. 
S/he identified that at that point in time, the unit was very busy; Triage was full; there were 3 patients who presented at once with same symptoms. S/he identified the 4th pt. came in and thought she was ""leaking fluid and complaining of pain."" The pt. saw the person before her go to the waiting room as OB triage was full. The pt. did not want to wait and asked how long the wait would be. She was told unsure, trying to move as fast as we can, maybe thirty minutes or less. Employee #7 identified that s/he asked pt. #1 to sign in; however, the pt. refused treatment and asked for a closer hospital. She asked for the (name of the receiving hospital) phone number. Pt. #1 called the receiving facility on her cell phone and spoke to the OB department. Employee #7 said that s/he tried to get the pt. to register to be seen; pt. declined and left.
  
Employee #4 confirmed during an interview on 11/28 and 11/29 that she was not present when the event occurred; however, when she interviewed Employee #7 it was reported that the pt. presented to the unit and waited to register. When it was her turn to register, the pt. asked ""how long is it going to be? (Probably, because she saw the pt. in front of her be escorted to the waiting room)."" 
The patient was told, ""We are moving quickly but it could be 30 minutes."" The pt. asked, ""where the next nearest hospital was?"" and she was told ""you can go to any hospital."" She was asked to register to be seen and the pt. refused to be registered and left the unit.

Employee #2 confirmed that the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form is a standard requirement for all patients who present to the L & D Department to fill out.
 
Both, Employee #5 & Employee #7 confirmed during private interviews that every pt. that presents to the L& D unit will fill out the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form, and that they never had a patient who didn't fill out the form. Both reported, the only time when the form is not filled out by the patient is when they are in active labor, and in that case the unit secretary would fill out the information on patient's behalf. The information from the OB Triage/Medical Screening Form is entered in the system, patient is registered and a label is generated with the patient's name, age, DOB, admin date. This label is included in the L & D log, for each pt.

However, there was no documentation that patient #1 was entered in the log, in accordance with the hospital's policy titled 'Care of the Obstetrical Patient', and Section 489.20(r)(3).

There was no documentation that the hospital staff followed the facility EMTALA policy related to required documentation in the Central log, or following the AMA policy related to refusal of treatment and leaving AMA (Against Medical Advice).

Based on review of the emergency room    (ER) Log, review of the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, policy and procedure review, and interview, it was determined the facility failed to accurately and completely record Patient #25's ER  presentation into the ER  Log.  Failure to enter Patient #25's name into the ER  Log did not allow the facility to track Patient #25's presentation and treatment.  The failed practice affected Patient #25 and had the likelihood to affect all patients presenting to the ER.  Findings included:

A.  Review of Medical Staff Rules and Regulations under ""General Rules Regarding Emergency Services,"" on 07/23/19, showed, ""an appropriate medical record shall be kept for every patient receiving emergency service and be incorporated into the patient's hospital record, if such exists.

RN #1 stated the ER  alerted the EMS crew that North Metro Medical Center was an inappropriate facility due to not having OB (obstetrics) services.  RN #1 stated EMS still brought Patient #25 in due to the patient's transportation home.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was in the ER  approximately one and a half minutes with profuse bleeding.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was transferred from the hospital bed to the EMS gurney with profuse bleeding noted on both beds.  RN #1 stated that EMS crew said, ""We need to move with her.""  RN #1 stated Patient #25 signed an AMA (Against Medical Advice) form.  RN #1 stated Patient #25's name was withheld from them so they could not register the patient.  RN #1 stated the AMA form was in his mailbox in the ER.  RN #2 stated he didn't know what to with it (AMA form).  RN #1 stated Patient #25 made the decision to go to another facility.  RN #1 stated Patient #25 was not placed on the ER  Log because no name was given.

H.  On 07/23/19 at 12:20 PM Physican #1 was interviewed via telephone.  Physician #1 stated, to his understanding, Patient #25 signed an AMA form.  Physician #1 stated he did not touch the patient.  Physician #1 stated he had heard about the blood on the gurney and bed but he did not see it himself.  Physician #1 stated to his understanding she immediately stated she didn't want to stay.  Physician #1 stated he did not assess Patient #25.  Phsycian #1 stated Patient #25 signed an AMA form and he felt he couldn't legally touch the patient.

I.  The CEO retrieved the AMA form from RN #1's mail box in the ER  on 07/23/19.  The AMA form was signed on 07/17/19 at 11:05 AM.

Based on clinical record review and interview, it was determined the Facility failed to provide an appropriate transfer for three (#1, #8 and #9) of nine (#1, #4, #7, #10, #14, #15, #17, #18 and #20) patients transferred in that the facility failed to send copies of the patient's medical records to the receiving facility and failed to transfer three (#1, #8 and #9) of (#1, #4, #7, #10, #14, #15, #17, #18 and #20) patients via qualified personnel and transportation equipment.  The failed practice placed the patients at risk of delivery during personal transport to the receiving Facility and had the potential to affect all patients presenting in labor that require transfer to another facility.  The findings follow:

Registered Nurse OB Triage note dated 04/21/14 at 0500 revealed, ""Gestational age (weeks): 32.3; Chief complaint: SROM; Contractions: irregular; Rupture of membranes: ruptured; Comments: pt arrives amb (ambulatory) with c/o SROM around 0315 this a.m., pt states she had a big gush of clear fluid with some abd tightening noted, denies any pain or vag (vaginal) bleeding at this time, pt states she is visiting family and requesting that if any way possible we transfer/allow her to go to her primary care OB in Bossier City, LA, due to insurance and physician preference, pt reassured we would do whatever possible but most important was fetal and maternal well being, VE done cx (cervix) 1cm (centimeter)/thick/ballotable, mod (moderate) amount clear fluid noted with VE, abd soft nontender to palp, EFM applied, findings per flowsheet, SO (significant other) at bedside, no request at this time.""
2.  Registered Nurse OB Triage note dated 04/21/14 at 0520 revealed, ""Dr. (named) called and notified of pt status and request, new orders received and noted.""
3.  Physician telephone order dated 04/21/14 at 0520 revealed, ""Discharge pt to go straight to hospital in Shreveport.""
4.  Discharge Summary Teaching/Instructions/Referrals dated 04/21/14 at 0524 revealed, ""Go directly to health care facility in Bossier City, LA for further OB care under primary OB physician.""

D.  The findings were confirmed in an interview with the Director of Quality and Risk Management on 06/23/14 at 1430.




Based on clinical record review and interview, it was determined the physician failed to sign the certification stating the risks and benefits of the transfer to another Facility for four (#7, #17, #20 and #21) of nine (#1, #4, #7, #10, #14, #15, #17, #18 and #20) patients.  The failed practice did not ensure the physician agreed with the stated risks and benefits of the transfer. This failed practice the potential to affect all obstetrical patients emergently transferred from the Facility.  The findings follow:

A.  Review of patient #7's clinical record on 06/23/14 revealed the patient was transferred from the Facility on 04/24/14.  Review of the Patient Transfer Form revealed the physician signature was blank.

B.  Review of patient #17's clinical record on 06/23/14 revealed the patient was transferred from the Facility on 03/22/14.  Review of the Patient Transfer Form revealed the physician signature was blank.

C.  Review of patient #20's clinical record on 06/23/14 revealed the patient was transferred from the Facility on 05/22/14.  Review of the Patient Transfer Form revealed the physician signature line had a Registered Nurse's signature/Physician's name.  There was no evidence the physician signed the form.

D.  Review of patient #21's clinical record on 06/23/14 revealed the patient was transferred from the facility on 02/26/14.  Review of the Patient Transfer Form revealed the physician signature was blank.

E.  The findings were confirmed in an interview with the Chief Nursing Officer on 06/23/14 at 1530.

Based on staff interview, Emergency Department (ED) record review, policy and procedure (P&P) and central ED log review, the hospital failed to maintain a central log on each individual who comes to the emergency department seeking assistance and document whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, or whether he or she was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   , for 1 of 20 patients reviewed (Patient 3).

Findings:

Review of Emergency Department's policy titled ""Register-Emergency Department "" (last revised 9/12) indicated the purpose was ""To ensure an accurate recording of all Emergency Department (ED) visits in a permanent register."" The policy directed that ""1. All patients who are registered to be seen in the ED shall be recorded in a permanent register. The T-system (electronic record system) generates a department log. 2. Such register shall contain: date, time of registration, patient name, address, age and sex, method of arrival, diagnosis, time of discharge, transfer or admission and treating physician."" The policy did not make a reference to any other ED logs in the hospital.

On 4/10/13 starting at 9 am, the Patient Care Executive stated that ED patient logs were maintained electronically. In addition to the ED log, there was Obstetrical (OB) Central Log  patient log maintained by the Family Birth Center in the Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit for all patients presenting to the L&D. The OB log was not maintained electronically. 

Review of the ""Obstetric (OB) Central Log"" showed that Patient 3 presented to the Family Birth Center, Labor and Delivery (L&D) unit, on 3/30/13 at 1:15 p.m. for decreased fetal movement. The log was blank in multiple areas for Patient 3's visit, including assessment/procedure section, length of stay, disposition and time and date of disposition. The OB central log did not indicate if patients presented to the L&D unit for routine (scheduled) care or for emergency (walk-in, unscheduled) care. Review of Patient 3's L&D record for 3/30/13 at 1:15 p.m. visit showed that Patient 3 presented unscheduled with complaint of decreased fetal movements and that the L&D nurse performed a Fetal Non-Stress test (NST) and the patient was discharged    home.

In an interview on 4/11/13 at 11 a.m. the L&D Manager and the ED Manager stated that patients who were pregnant 20 weeks or over were directed and provided a medical screening exam by an L&D RN per the ""Medical Screening Exam (MSE)"" policy when presenting unscheduled for pregnancy related emergency care. Those patients were logged in the Obstetric Central Log along with any other pregnant patients presenting to L&D unit for scheduled testing, such as routine NST and other appointments. The L&D Manager confirmed the OB log was incomplete for Patient 3. The L&D Manager confirmed that the OB log did not distinguish between emergency and non-emergency patients, and without looking at each patient's record, there was no way of telling which patients were emergency patients. The ED Manager stated that the OB log was not reviewed by the ED Department for emergency care.

BASED ON STAFF INTERVIEW, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) RECORD REVIEW, POLICY AND PROCEDURE (P&P) AND CENTRAL ED LOG REVIEW, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO MAINTAIN A CENTRAL LOG ON EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO COMES TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SEEKING ASSISTANCE AND DOCUMENT WHETHER HE OR SHE REFUSED TREATMENT, WAS REFUSED TREATMENT, OR WHETHER HE OR SHE WAS TRANSFERRED, ADMITTED     AND TREATED, STABILIZED AND TRANSFERRED, OR DISCHARGED   , FOR 1 OF 20 PATIENTS REVIEWED (PATIENT 3).

FINDINGS:

REVIEW OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT'S POLICY TITLED ""REGISTER-EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT "" (LAST REVISED 9/12) INDICATED THE PURPOSE WAS ""TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE RECORDING OF ALL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS IN A PERMANENT REGISTER."" THE POLICY DIRECTED THAT ""1. ALL PATIENTS WHO ARE REGISTERED TO BE SEEN IN THE ED SHALL BE RECORDED IN A PERMANENT REGISTER. THE T-SYSTEM (ELECTRONIC RECORD SYSTEM) GENERATES A DEPARTMENT LOG. 2. SUCH REGISTER SHALL CONTAIN: DATE, TIME OF REGISTRATION, PATIENT NAME, ADDRESS, AGE AND SEX, METHOD OF ARRIVAL, DIAGNOSIS, TIME OF DISCHARGE, TRANSFER OR ADMISSION AND TREATING PHYSICIAN."" THE POLICY DID NOT MAKE A REFERENCE TO ANY OTHER ED LOGS IN THE HOSPITAL.

ON 4/10/13 STARTING AT 9 AM, THE PATIENT CARE EXECUTIVE STATED THAT ED PATIENT LOGS WERE MAINTAINED ELECTRONICALLY. IN ADDITION TO THE ED LOG, THERE WAS OBSTETRICAL (OB) CENTRAL LOG  PATIENT LOG MAINTAINED BY THE FAMILY BIRTH CENTER IN THE LABOR AND DELIVERY (L&D) UNIT FOR ALL PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE L&D. THE OB LOG WAS NOT MAINTAINED ELECTRONICALLY. 

REVIEW OF THE ""OBSTETRIC (OB) CENTRAL LOG"" SHOWED THAT PATIENT 3 PRESENTED TO THE FAMILY BIRTH CENTER, LABOR AND DELIVERY (L&D) UNIT, ON 3/30/13 AT 1:15 P.M. FOR DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT. THE LOG WAS BLANK IN MULTIPLE AREAS FOR PATIENT 3'S VISIT, INCLUDING ASSESSMENT/PROCEDURE SECTION, LENGTH OF STAY, DISPOSITION AND TIME AND DATE OF DISPOSITION. THE OB CENTRAL LOG DID NOT INDICATE IF PATIENTS PRESENTED TO THE L&D UNIT FOR ROUTINE (SCHEDULED) CARE OR FOR EMERGENCY (WALK-IN, UNSCHEDULED) CARE. REVIEW OF PATIENT 3'S L&D RECORD FOR 3/30/13 AT 1:15 P.M. VISIT SHOWED THAT PATIENT 3 PRESENTED UNSCHEDULED WITH COMPLAINT OF DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENTS AND THAT THE L&D NURSE PERFORMED A FETAL NON-STRESS TEST (NST) AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    HOME.

IN AN INTERVIEW ON 4/11/13 AT 11 A.M. THE L&D MANAGER AND THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT PATIENTS WHO WERE PREGNANT 20 WEEKS OR OVER WERE DIRECTED AND PROVIDED A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM BY AN L&D RN PER THE ""MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM (MSE)"" POLICY WHEN PRESENTING UNSCHEDULED FOR PREGNANCY RELATED EMERGENCY CARE. THOSE PATIENTS WERE LOGGED IN THE OBSTETRIC CENTRAL LOG ALONG WITH ANY OTHER PREGNANT PATIENTS PRESENTING TO L&D UNIT FOR SCHEDULED TESTING, SUCH AS ROUTINE NST AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS. THE L&D MANAGER CONFIRMED THE OB LOG WAS INCOMPLETE FOR PATIENT 3. THE L&D MANAGER CONFIRMED THAT THE OB LOG DID NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EMERGENCY AND NON-EMERGENCY PATIENTS, AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT EACH PATIENT'S RECORD, THERE WAS NO WAY OF TELLING WHICH PATIENTS WERE EMERGENCY PATIENTS. THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT THE OB LOG WAS NOT REVIEWED BY THE ED DEPARTMENT FOR EMERGENCY CARE.

Based on documentation and interview, medical and nursing staff failed to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) for two of 29 sampled patients (18 and 19).

Findings:

1.  The record review on 1/13/12 at 10 a.m. indicated Patient 18 arrived at Labor and Delivery (L&D) on 1/5/12 at  9:24 a.m. The labor and delivery drop in sheet (log) indicated ""labor"" was the reason for Patient 18's visit. The Physician Orders L&D Triage Orders included ""obtain maternal vitals signs"".

At 9:47 a.m. the nurse's OB (obstetrics) triage note recorded the patient's level of consciousness as ""lethargy"". There was no record of the patient's blood pressure or heart rate in the record. The ""OB provider admission history and physical"" record did not include Patient 1's vital signs or address the lethargy.  On 1/15/12 at 10:20 a.m. Attending Physician A discharged    Patient 18 home without a review of vital signs or comment on the patient's lethargy.

Registered Nurse B (RN B) stated during a telephone interview on 1/17/12 at 12:15 p.m. she thought she had recorded the vital signs while she assessed Patient 1 in the examination room.  The medical record indicated the fetal monitor recorded the baby's heart rate but the strip did not include the mother's blood pressure and heart rate. 

Attending Physician A was interviewed on 1/13/12 at 2 p.m. and acknowledged there was no blood pressure or heart rate recorded in the patient's record.  The physician stated she would have asked for the vital signs if she had noticed they were missing but remained confident the patient was stable and there were no indications of potential changes in her medical condition.

During an interview on 1/13/12 at 10:20 a.m., the chief of obstetrics and gynecology (COOBG) stated he was notified by a physician at another local hospital, Patient 18 arrived by ambulance on 1/6/12 and died    in the receiving hospital's emergency room   . The COOBG acknowledged an MSE would include an examination of the patient and a review of vital signs. Although the patient's complaint was not unusual for their department, nursing and medical staff were required to document the MSE.  

2.  The record review on 3/7/12 indicated Patient 19 arrived in the emergency department on 1/25/12 at 4:25 p.m.  The labor and delivery drop in sheet (log) indicated the reason for the visit was decreased fetal movement.  The OB provider admission history and physical indicated Patient 19 was discharged    at 4:52 p.m. as stable without evidence the physician reviewed the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. 

According to the regulation individuals coming to labor and delivery for emergency visits must be provided an appropriate MSE.

BASED ON DOCUMENTATION AND INTERVIEW, MEDICAL AND NURSING STAFF FAILED TO CONDUCT AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION (MSE) FOR TWO OF 29 SAMPLED PATIENTS (18 AND 19).

FINDINGS:

1.  THE RECORD REVIEW ON 1/13/12 AT 10 A.M. INDICATED PATIENT 18 ARRIVED AT LABOR AND DELIVERY (L&D) ON 1/5/12 AT  9:24 A.M. THE LABOR AND DELIVERY DROP IN SHEET (LOG) INDICATED ""LABOR"" WAS THE REASON FOR PATIENT 18'S VISIT. THE PHYSICIAN ORDERS L&D TRIAGE ORDERS INCLUDED ""OBTAIN MATERNAL VITALS SIGNS"".

AT 9:47 A.M. THE NURSE'S OB (OBSTETRICS) TRIAGE NOTE RECORDED THE PATIENT'S LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS ""LETHARGY"". THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE OR HEART RATE IN THE RECORD. THE ""OB PROVIDER ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL"" RECORD DID NOT INCLUDE PATIENT 1'S VITAL SIGNS OR ADDRESS THE LETHARGY.  ON 1/15/12 AT 10:20 A.M. ATTENDING PHYSICIAN A DISCHARGED    PATIENT 18 HOME WITHOUT A REVIEW OF VITAL SIGNS OR COMMENT ON THE PATIENT'S LETHARGY.

REGISTERED NURSE B (RN B) STATED DURING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW ON 1/17/12 AT 12:15 P.M. SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD RECORDED THE VITAL SIGNS WHILE SHE ASSESSED PATIENT 1 IN THE EXAMINATION ROOM.  THE MEDICAL RECORD INDICATED THE FETAL MONITOR RECORDED THE BABY'S HEART RATE BUT THE STRIP DID NOT INCLUDE THE MOTHER'S BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE. 

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN A WAS INTERVIEWED ON 1/13/12 AT 2 P.M. AND ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS NO BLOOD PRESSURE OR HEART RATE RECORDED IN THE PATIENT'S RECORD.  THE PHYSICIAN STATED SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THE VITAL SIGNS IF SHE HAD NOTICED THEY WERE MISSING BUT REMAINED CONFIDENT THE PATIENT WAS STABLE AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL CHANGES IN HER MEDICAL CONDITION.

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 1/13/12 AT 10:20 A.M., THE CHIEF OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY (COOBG) STATED HE WAS NOTIFIED BY A PHYSICIAN AT ANOTHER LOCAL HOSPITAL, PATIENT 18 ARRIVED BY AMBULANCE ON 1/6/12 AND DIED    IN THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOM   . THE COOBG ACKNOWLEDGED AN MSE WOULD INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PATIENT AND A REVIEW OF VITAL SIGNS. ALTHOUGH THE PATIENT'S COMPLAINT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THEIR DEPARTMENT, NURSING AND MEDICAL STAFF WERE REQUIRED TO DOCUMENT THE MSE.  

2.  THE RECORD REVIEW ON 3/7/12 INDICATED PATIENT 19 ARRIVED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON 1/25/12 AT 4:25 P.M.  THE LABOR AND DELIVERY DROP IN SHEET (LOG) INDICATED THE REASON FOR THE VISIT WAS DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT.  THE OB PROVIDER ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL INDICATED PATIENT 19 WAS DISCHARGED    AT 4:52 P.M. AS STABLE WITHOUT EVIDENCE THE PHYSICIAN REVIEWED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to facilitate an appropriate transfer for one of four sampled transferred patients (Patient 10) when a Physician Certification & Authorization (physician signed certification of the risks and benefits of transfer) and a Patient Transfer Acknowledgement (consent) for Patient 10 were not available. This failure had the potential for Patient 10's responsible party to be unable to make informed decisions before consenting to the transfer.  

Findings:

During a concurrent interview and record review on 3/31/21, at 2:10 PM, with Clinical Informationist 2 (person skilled in the facility's electronic medical records), Patient 10's Emergency Department (ED) records, dated 1/18/21, at 8:30 AM, were reviewed. Patient 10's ""Emergency Documentation"" indicated the following:
Patient 10 was 4 years old, born prematurely at 31 weeks (A preterm or premature baby is delivered before 37 weeks of the pregnancy), had [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (a condition marked by impaired muscle coordination, typically caused by damage to the brain before or at birth), Infantile Spasm Seizures (burst of uncontrolled electrical activity between brain cells causing muscles in the arms and legs to stiffen and bend the baby's head forward), and asthma (swelling and narrowing of the airways [tubes] in the lungs). 
Patient 10 arrived by ambulance with mother for seizure-like activity and vomiting. Patient 10 received Versed (medication used to treat seizures) 0.37 milligrams (mg, unit of measurement) prior to arrival at the ED. In the ED, Patient 10 had full body tonic-clonic (type of seizure characterized by stiffening and rhythmic jerking) seizure activity. Patient 10 received an additional two doses of Versed 1.5 mg and Keppra (medication used to treat seizures). The facility pediatrician recommended Patient 10 transfer to a children's specialty hospital. 
Clinical Informationist 2 was unable to provide neither a Physician Certification & Authorization nor a signed Patient Transfer Acknowledgement for Patient 10.

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 10:50 AM, with Clinical Informationist 1 (CI) 1, CI 1 stated, transfer records should be located in the scanned documents; there was no other place the patient transfer documentation would be. 

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 2:37 PM, with ED Clinical Educator (EDCE), EDCE stated, the medical provider should provide a risk and benefit statement to the patient and document the discussion in the medical record.

During an interview on 3/31/21, at 4:30 PM, with Risk Management staff (RM), RM staff stated, she would contact medical records for the transfer records related to Patient 10's transfer.

During a review of a handwritten note, (undated) from RM staff, on 4/1/21, at 1:21 PM, the handwritten note indicated, ""Unable to locate [transfer] Forms.""

During a review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, approved 12/21/20, the Rules and Regulations indicated, EMTALA Transfers: (a) The transfer of a patient with an emergency medical condition from the Emergency Department to another hospital will be made in accordance with the District's applicable policy and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws, such as EMTALA. (b) Before any such transfer occurs, a physician must see the patient and enter a certification in the patient's medical record indicating that the medical benefits to be received at another medical facility outweigh the risk to the patient of being transferred. . .(4) provide the following information to the patient whenever the patient is transferred: (i) the reason for the transfer (ii) the risks and benefits of the transfer; and (iii) available alternatives to the transfer.""

During a review of the facility's policy and procedure (P&P) titled ""Compliance with EMTALA,"" approved 1/29/2020, the P&P indicated, [facility name] sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) available at the time of transfer related to the emergency condition of the patient, including;  ...b. the patient's informed written consent to transfer or the physician's certification (or copy thereof). The P&P indicated, the ""Physician Certification - The written certification by the treating physician ordering a transfer and setting forth, based on the information available at the time of transfer, that the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual ...""

BASED ON INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW, THE FACILITY FAILED TO FACILITATE AN APPROPRIATE TRANSFER FOR ONE OF FOUR SAMPLED TRANSFERRED PATIENTS (PATIENT 10) WHEN A PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION & AUTHORIZATION (PHYSICIAN SIGNED CERTIFICATION OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF TRANSFER) AND A PATIENT TRANSFER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (CONSENT) FOR PATIENT 10 WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THIS FAILURE HAD THE POTENTIAL FOR PATIENT 10'S RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO BE UNABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS BEFORE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER.  

FINDINGS:

DURING A CONCURRENT INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW ON 3/31/21, AT 2:10 PM, WITH CLINICAL INFORMATIONIST 2 (PERSON SKILLED IN THE FACILITY'S ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS), PATIENT 10'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) RECORDS, DATED 1/18/21, AT 8:30 AM, WERE REVIEWED.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to consistently provide on-call coverage for the emergency department (ED) commensurate with services available at the hospital. The hospital had ten members (Providers 1 through 10) of its medical staff in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), nine of which (Providers 1 through 8, and 10) provided routine services at the hospital. Yet the on call schedule for the ED offered OB/GYN coverage only for trauma patients, and a reference sheet regarding the scope of the hospital's services for emergency transfers indicated OB/GYN was not provided. Two of 20 sampled patients (Patients 2 and 7) did receive non-trauma OB/GYN on-call coverage in the ED and one of 20 sampled patients (Patient 1) did not.

Findings:

Review of Patient 1's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 7/5/21 complaining of a fever, bleeding, and pain following a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) at Hospital C on 6/19/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 7/5/21 indicated, ""I discussed the case with the patient's surgeon [Physician B] who felt that the patient should be treated here at Regional Medical Center however we do not have gyn service on-call. I discussed with our CMO [chief medical officer]... who states that the patient should be transferred ER  [emergency room   ] to ER  to [Hospital C] where the patient had the initial surgery for this post op [post-operative] complication. This would be for higher level of care for Gyn services.""

Review of the physician on-call schedules provided by the hospital indicated the schedules for the OB/GYN service for January 2021 through July 2021 were labeled ""OB/GYN - TRAUMA ONLY"". No on-call schedule for non-trauma OB/GYN was provided.

Review of the ""Regional Medical Center Reference List"" (revised 4/14/21) indicated the document delineated dispositions for various types of patients being considered for transfer in to the hospital. The document indicated OB/GYN was not offered on an on-call basis and that such patients could be declined without escalating to the administrator on call since the service was not offered.

Review of the hospital's undated medical staff roster indicated there were ten members of the medical staff specializing in OB/GYN (Providers 1 through 10), and that Physician B was not a member of the medical staff at the hospital.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:04 p.m., the Director of Medical Staff (DMS) stated the OB service had been closed in April, 2020 and the case volumes of the OB/GYN medical staff had been nil since then. The DMS stated the call schedule for the emergency room    was maintained because of trauma. The DMS stated Provider 9 had ""ambulatory"" status on the medical staff, which was a status pertaining to clinic physicians who do not come to the hospital.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:26 p.m., the Quality Director of Clinical Excellence (QDCE) stated the OB service at the hospital was closed on March 30, 2020 because it was not financially viable due to too few patients. She stated the perinatal unit was taken off the hospital's license on 6/11/21.

Review of a letter from the California Department of Public Health to the QDCE dated 6/8/20 indicated the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the perinatal unit were removed from the hospital license effective 5/30/20.

Review of Provider 1's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 7/1/21 for a two-year term. Provider 1's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies (removal of the uterus through the vagina or the abdominal wall), laparascopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH, using a fiber-optic tube for part of the surgery), and total laparascopic hysterectomy (TLH, using fiber-optic tubes rather than traditional incisions for the surgery). Provider 1's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had performed 5 surgeries and admitted     8 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 4's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 6/23/20 for a term expiring on 5/31/22. Provider 3's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 4's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had performed 11 surgeries at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 5's credentials file indicated he was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 11/7/19 for a term expiring on 10/31/21. Provider 5's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies, and LAVH. Provider 5's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 2 surgeries and admitted     15 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 6's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 4/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 6's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 6's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated she had not performed any surgeries or admitted     any inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 7's credentials file indicated she was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 5/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 7's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies, LAVH, and TLH. Provider 7's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 11 surgeries and admitted     6 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 8's credentials file indicated he was an active member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 2/25/20 for a term expiring on 1/31/22. Provider 8's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 8's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 6 surgeries at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

Review of Provider 9's credentials file indicated she was a member of the medical staff in the ambulatory (outpatient) category, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 1/16/20 for a term expiring on 11/30/21. Provider 9's credentials file indicated she did not have privileges at the hospital.

Review of Provider 10's credentials file indicated he was a courtesy member of the medical staff, specialty OB/GYN, last reappointed on 6/1/21 for a two year term. Provider 10's privileges included (among others) inpatient admitting and attending, core procedural privileges, vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies. Provider 10's case log for dates of service June 2020 to June 2021 indicated he had performed 7 surgeries and admitted     2 inpatients at the hospital during the time period covered by the report.

In an interview on 7/20/21 at 12:42 p.m., the DMS stated OBs were called in to the ED, not only for trauma patients. He stated the OB/GYNs on the medical staff were still doing hysterectomies at the hospital.

Review of Patient 2's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 1/26/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 1/26/21 indicated, ""SHE WAS SENT HERE BY HER OB/GYN TO RULE OUT MISCARRIAGE VERSUS [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]."" (In an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED], the embryo attaches outside the uterus. The fetus usually cannot survive, and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] can cause severe bleeding in the mother.) The provider note did not indicate Patient 2 had any traumatic injuries. The provider note indicated the ED provider consulted Provider 3, an OB/GYN on the hospital's medical staff.

Review of Patient 7's medical record indicated she was seen at the ED on 6/9/21. The ""EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT"" dated 6/9/21 indicated ...Ob was consulted. Advised to initiate therapy for potential pre term labor..."" The provider report did not indicate Patient 7 had any traumatic injuries. The provider note indicated the ED provider consulted Provider 1, an OB/GYN on the hospital's medical staff.

In an interview on 7/21/21 at 10:57 a.m., the surveyor asked the QDCE to explain the inconsistent interviews and record reviews regarding OB/GYN on call coverage. The QDCE replied that to her knowledge, OB/GYN on call coverage was only for trauma, but she would have the chief medical officer (CMO) address the question.

In an interview on 7/21/21 at 11:23 a.m., the CMO stated OB provided trauma call for any pregnant trauma patient. She stated the labor & delivery unit at the hospital was closed on 5/3/20. Initially, the OB service supported any pregnant patient, but now on-call OB is only for OB trauma. The CMO stated the hospital has OB/GYNs on its medical staff, who bring patients to the hospital to have surgical procedures, and those patients may be admitted    , but the OB/GYNs do not take calls. Regarding Patient 1, the CMO stated anyone who operates cares for their own patients for the first 30 days after surgery. The CMO acknowledged Patient 1's surgeon, Physician B, was not on the medical staff at the hospital, and stated Physician B would not have seen the patient, so the hospital would triage and transfer such a patient. The CMO stated the physicians who had covered the labor and delivery unit had resigned, and the remaining members of the medical staff did not provide consultations on inpatients. When the surveyor asked why Patients 2 and 7, who were not trauma patients, had OB consults while they were in the ED, the CMO replied that OB helps the ED out of courtesy, but they are not on call.

BASED ON INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE ON-CALL COVERAGE FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) COMMENSURATE WITH SERVICES AVAILABLE AT THE HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL HAD TEN MEMBERS (PROVIDERS 1 THROUGH 10) OF ITS MEDICAL STAFF IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY (OB/GYN), NINE OF WHICH (PROVIDERS 1 THROUGH 8, AND 10) PROVIDED ROUTINE SERVICES AT THE HOSPITAL.

IN AN INTERVIEW ON 7/21/21 AT 10:57 A.M., THE SURVEYOR ASKED THE QDCE TO EXPLAIN THE INCONSISTENT INTERVIEWS AND RECORD REVIEWS REGARDING OB/GYN ON CALL COVERAGE. THE QDCE REPLIED THAT TO HER KNOWLEDGE, OB/GYN ON CALL COVERAGE WAS ONLY FOR TRAUMA, BUT SHE WOULD HAVE THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER (CMO) ADDRESS THE QUESTION.

IN AN INTERVIEW ON 7/21/21 AT 11:23 A.M., THE CMO STATED OB PROVIDED TRAUMA CALL FOR ANY PREGNANT TRAUMA PATIENT. SHE STATED THE LABOR & DELIVERY UNIT AT THE HOSPITAL WAS CLOSED ON 5/3/20. INITIALLY, THE OB SERVICE SUPPORTED ANY PREGNANT PATIENT, BUT NOW ON-CALL OB IS ONLY FOR OB TRAUMA. THE CMO STATED THE HOSPITAL HAS OB/GYNS ON ITS MEDICAL STAFF, WHO BRING PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL TO HAVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, AND THOSE PATIENTS MAY BE ADMITTED    , BUT THE OB/GYNS DO NOT TAKE CALLS. REGARDING PATIENT 1, THE CMO STATED ANYONE WHO OPERATES CARES FOR THEIR OWN PATIENTS FOR THE FIRST 30 DAYS AFTER SURGERY. THE CMO ACKNOWLEDGED PATIENT 1'S SURGEON, PHYSICIAN B, WAS NOT ON THE MEDICAL STAFF AT THE HOSPITAL, AND STATED PHYSICIAN B WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE PATIENT, SO THE HOSPITAL WOULD TRIAGE AND TRANSFER SUCH A PATIENT. THE CMO STATED THE PHYSICIANS WHO HAD COVERED THE LABOR AND DELIVERY UNIT HAD RESIGNED, AND THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF DID NOT PROVIDE CONSULTATIONS ON INPATIENTS. WHEN THE SURVEYOR ASKED WHY PATIENTS 2 AND 7, WHO WERE NOT TRAUMA PATIENTS, HAD OB CONSULTS WHILE THEY WERE IN THE ED, THE CMO REPLIED THAT OB HELPS THE ED OUT OF COURTESY, BUT THEY ARE NOT ON CALL.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to ensure one of 20 patients' (Patient 1) medical records contained a physician certification (a documentation indicating that a physician certifies the expected medical benefits of the transfer outweigh the increased risks that results from being transferred) or document specifying the expected benefits of the transfer and risks associated with the transfer. This failure had a potential to deprive patients of information necessary to make informed decisions about their treatment and transfer and could cause an unnecessary transfer with unspecified reasons of the transfer. 

Findings:

Review of Patient 1's Emergency Provider Report, dated 7/5/21, indicated the patient was a [AGE]-year-old female, with past history of hysterectomy (surgery to remove a woman's uterus [the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant]) on 6/19/2 in Hospital C, and presented to the ED (emergency department) complaining of bleeding from the post-op (postoperative) site on the abdomen and associated abdominal pain.

On the same report, Review of Free Text MDM (Medical Decision Making) Notes indicated at 2:58 p.m., Physician A re-evaluated Patient 1 and ""some pus was also expressed from the wound."" Physician A discussed Patient 1's care with Patient 1's surgeon in Hospital C, ""who felt that the patient should be treated here at [the hospital name] however we do not have gyn [gynecology, the branch of physiology and medicine which deals with the functions and diseases specific to women and girls, especially those affecting the reproductive system] service on-call."" It indicated Physician A discussed  with the chief medical officer (CMO) and the CMO stated the patient should be transferred to Hospital C where the patient had the initial surgery for the post-op complication and ""this would be for higher level of care for Gyn services."" At 5:30 p.m. Physician A discussed the case with a doctor who accepted the patient in transfer to Hospital C for higher level of care for gynecology services. There was no documentation regarding the expected medical benefits and risks associated with transfer and/or whether the benefits outweighed the risks.  

Review of Patient 1's Emergency Patient Record, dated 7/5/21, indicated at 7:10 p.m. Patient 1 was transferred to Hospital C. There was no physician certification indicating the physician certified that the expected benefits of the transfer outweighed the risks.

Review of the hospital's Memorandum of Transfer, a transfer form utilized in the hospital, indicated the form certified the risk and benefits of the transfer, verification of health records being sent, accepting physician, and certification whether the patient was in stable condition. 

During an interview on 7/19/21 at 2:10 p.m., Quality Director of Clinical Excellence (QDCE) stated when a patient is transferred to another hospital, the physician has to fill the form, Memorandum of Transfer. She reviewed Patient 1's medical records and stated Patient 1's record did not contain Memorandum of Transfer form.

Review of the hospital's policy, ""EMTALA-CALIFORNIA TRANSFER POLICY"", dated 11/2016, indicated any transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition must be initiated either by a written request for transfer from the individual or the legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, or by a physician order with the appropriate physician certification as required under EMTALA. It indicated a physician must sign an express written certification that, based on the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual. The certification should meet the following requirements: 1) The certification must state the reason for transfer. The narrative rationale need not be a lengthy discussion of the individual's medical condition as this can be found in the medical record but should be specific to the condition of the patient upon transfer. 2) The certification must contain a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time away from an acute care setting necessary to effect the transfer. 3) The date and time of the physician certification should closely match the date and time of the transfer. 4) Certifications may not be backdated. It further indicated a Memorandum of Transfer must be completed for every patient who is transferred to anther separately licensed hospital. A copy of the Memorandum of Transfer shall be retained by the transferring hospital and incorporated into the patient's medical record.    

Review of the hospital's policy,""EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT TRANSFER PROCESS"", dated 4/9/31, indicated the physician completes the Physician Section of the Memorandum of Transfer (MOT) form after reviewing all ordered tests and treatments and stabilizing the patient and certifies the patient status for transfer by signing the certification. The primary care nurse completes the nursing section of the MOT form.

BASED ON INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO ENSURE ONE OF 20 PATIENTS' (PATIENT 1) MEDICAL RECORDS CONTAINED A PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION (A DOCUMENTATION INDICATING THAT A PHYSICIAN CERTIFIES THE EXPECTED MEDICAL BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER OUTWEIGH THE INCREASED RISKS THAT RESULTS FROM BEING TRANSFERRED) OR DOCUMENT SPECIFYING THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFER. THIS FAILURE HAD A POTENTIAL TO DEPRIVE PATIENTS OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR TREATMENT AND TRANSFER AND COULD CAUSE AN UNNECESSARY TRANSFER WITH UNSPECIFIED REASONS OF THE TRANSFER. 

FINDINGS:

REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S EMERGENCY PROVIDER REPORT, DATED 7/5/21, INDICATED THE PATIENT WAS A [AGE]-YEAR-OLD FEMALE, WITH PAST HISTORY OF HYSTERECTOMY (SURGERY TO REMOVE A WOMAN'S UTERUS [THE PLACE WHERE A BABY GROWS WHEN A WOMAN IS PREGNANT]) ON 6/19/2 IN HOSPITAL C, AND PRESENTED TO THE ED (EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT) COMPLAINING OF BLEEDING FROM THE POST-OP (POSTOPERATIVE) SITE ON THE ABDOMEN AND ASSOCIATED ABDOMINAL PAIN.

ON THE SAME REPORT, REVIEW OF FREE TEXT MDM (MEDICAL DECISION MAKING) NOTES INDICATED AT 2:58 P.M., PHYSICIAN A RE-EVALUATED PATIENT 1 AND ""SOME PUS WAS ALSO EXPRESSED FROM THE WOUND."" PHYSICIAN A DISCUSSED PATIENT 1'S CARE WITH PATIENT 1'S SURGEON IN HOSPITAL C, ""WHO FELT THAT THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TREATED HERE AT [THE HOSPITAL NAME] HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE GYN [GYNECOLOGY, THE BRANCH OF PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE WHICH DEALS WITH THE FUNCTIONS AND DISEASES SPECIFIC TO WOMEN AND GIRLS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTING THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM] SERVICE ON-CALL."" IT INDICATED PHYSICIAN A DISCUSSED  WITH THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER (CMO) AND THE CMO STATED THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL C WHERE THE PATIENT HAD THE INITIAL SURGERY FOR THE POST-OP COMPLICATION AND ""THIS WOULD BE FOR HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE FOR GYN SERVICES."" AT 5:30 P.M. PHYSICIAN A DISCUSSED THE CASE WITH A DOCTOR WHO ACCEPTED THE PATIENT IN TRANSFER TO HOSPITAL C FOR HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE FOR GYNECOLOGY SERVICES. THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THE EXPECTED MEDICAL BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSFER AND/OR WHETHER THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGHED THE RISKS.  

REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S EMERGENCY PATIENT RECORD, DATED 7/5/21, INDICATED AT 7:10 P.M. PATIENT 1 WAS TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL C. THERE WAS NO PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION INDICATING THE PHYSICIAN CERTIFIED THAT THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER OUTWEIGHED THE RISKS.

REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER, A TRANSFER FORM UTILIZED IN THE HOSPITAL, INDICATED THE FORM CERTIFIED THE RISK AND BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER, VERIFICATION OF HEALTH RECORDS BEING SENT, ACCEPTING PHYSICIAN, AND CERTIFICATION WHETHER THE PATIENT WAS IN STABLE CONDITION. 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 7/19/21 AT 2:10 P.M., QUALITY DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL EXCELLENCE (QDCE) STATED WHEN A PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL, THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FILL THE FORM, MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER. SHE REVIEWED PATIENT 1'S MEDICAL RECORDS AND STATED PATIENT 1'S RECORD DID NOT CONTAIN MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER FORM.

REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY, ""EMTALA-CALIFORNIA TRANSFER POLICY"", DATED 11/2016, INDICATED ANY TRANSFER OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION MUST BE INITIATED EITHER BY A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR TRANSFER FROM THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE PERSON ACTING ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S BEHALF, OR BY A PHYSICIAN ORDER WITH THE APPROPRIATE PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION AS REQUIRED UNDER EMTALA. IT INDICATED A PHYSICIAN MUST SIGN AN EXPRESS WRITTEN CERTIFICATION THAT, BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER, THE MEDICAL BENEFITS REASONABLY EXPECTED FROM THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT AT ANOTHER MEDICAL FACILITY OUTWEIGH THE INCREASED RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THE CERTIFICATION SHOULD MEET THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS: 1) THE CERTIFICATION MUST STATE THE REASON FOR TRANSFER. THE NARRATIVE RATIONALE NEED NOT BE A LENGTHY DISCUSSION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICAL CONDITION AS THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE MEDICAL RECORD BUT SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE CONDITION OF THE PATIENT UPON TRANSFER. 2) THE CERTIFICATION MUST CONTAIN A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE BENEFITS TO BE EXPECTED FROM APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE RECEIVING FACILITY AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFER, INCLUDING THE TIME AWAY FROM AN ACUTE CARE SETTING NECESSARY TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER. 3) THE DATE AND TIME OF THE PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION SHOULD CLOSELY MATCH THE DATE AND TIME OF THE TRANSFER. 4) CERTIFICATIONS MAY NOT BE BACKDATED. IT FURTHER INDICATED A MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER MUST BE COMPLETED FOR EVERY PATIENT WHO IS TRANSFERRED TO ANTHER SEPARATELY LICENSED HOSPITAL. A COPY OF THE MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER SHALL BE RETAINED BY THE TRANSFERRING HOSPITAL AND INCORPORATED INTO THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD.    

REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY,""EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT TRANSFER PROCESS"", DATED 4/9/31, INDICATED THE PHYSICIAN COMPLETES THE PHYSICIAN SECTION OF THE MEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER (MOT) FORM AFTER REVIEWING ALL ORDERED TESTS AND TREATMENTS AND STABILIZING THE PATIENT AND CERTIFIES THE PATIENT STATUS FOR TRANSFER BY SIGNING THE CERTIFICATION. THE PRIMARY CARE NURSE COMPLETES THE NURSING SECTION OF THE MOT FORM.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to ensure that seven of 10 sampled  emergency department (ED) patients (Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16) who required transfer to a higher level of care for an Emergent Medical Condition (EMC) met the requirements for an appropriate transfer as follows:

1.  Patients 7, 8, 9 and 10's ""Physician Certification"" emergency transfer form was not properly authenticated with a date and time of the physician's signature.

2.  Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16's, ""Physician Certification"" did not contain: 
*  A description of the higher level of medical services that would cause the patient to benefit from the transfer,
*  The medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of the medical services available at the receiving facility, and that those benefits outweigh the increased risks to the individual from being transferred, and
*  A summary of the risks and benefits upon which the certification was based.

3.  Patients 7, 8, and 10's, ""Physician Certification"" form contained information that indicated the patients had been transferred using non-qualified personnel and transfer equipment

These failures have the potential for patients to have delays in receiving needed care and inappropriate transfers to another facility which could result in adverse outcomes including death.


Findings:

1.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 7 was reviewed.  Patient 7 was seen in the ED on 5/7/14 beginning at 7:37 pm with an initial complaint that she had thoughts of harming herself.  In the ED, a Medical Screening Examination (MSE) showed Patient 7 did have an emergency medical condition and was at risk of harming herself.  Patient 7 had previously been found unable to care for herself and placed under conservatorship.  Patient 7's conservator was contacted and arrangements were made to transfer Patient 7 to a psychiatric care facility. 

On 5/9/14 at or near 9:50 am, Patient 7 was transferred to the psychiatric facility for definitive care.  Patient 7's record contains a ""Physician Certification (for Emergent Transfer)"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate notes Patient 7 was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first and last name of an individual was listed.  There was no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

2.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 8 was reviewed.  Patient 8 was brought to the ED on 5/2/14 at 10:43 am by local law enforcement officers with the history of threatening others and himself.  In the ED, a MSE of Patient 9 showed he did have an emergency medical condition and was at risk of harming himself and others.  Because of this, Patient 8 was placed on involuntary psychiatric hold (5150) and plans were made to transfer him to psychiatric care specialty facility in a distant community. 

At 4:55 pm on 5/2/14, Patient 8 was transferred to the distant psychiatric care facility.  Patient 8?s record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate noted Patient 8 was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first name of an individual is listed.  There was no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

3.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 9 was reviewed.  Patient 9 was seen in the ED on 5/3/14 beginning at 2:47 pm with an initial complaint that she thought she had had a seizure.  Patient 9's MSE found that she did have a EMC and arrangements were made to send her to a medical center and physician where she had recently had some neurological (pertaining to nerves) specialty care.

At 4:55 pm on 5/3/14, Patient 9 was transferred to be admitted     by her neurologist (Physician specializing in nerve function) at a local medical center.  Patient 9's record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

4.  On 6/4/14, the record of Patient 10 was reviewed.  Patient 10 was brought to the ED on 5/4/14 at 1:38 am by local law enforcement officers with the history of being ""paranoid"" (a mental condition in which one falsely believes others are trying harm them).  Patient 10's MSE was not clearly delineated but concludes with ""Medically cleared and given (two medications) will be released and clearing her to a 5150.""  The phrase ""5150"" refers to a state legislative statute regarding patients that need to be involuntarily held for psychiatric care because they are a danger to themselves or others.  The record does not otherwise specify the reason for transfer or other specifics related to the care to be received at the receiving facility.

At 11:26 pm on 5/4/14, Patient 10 was transferred to the distant psychiatric care facility.  Patient 10's record contains a ""Physician Certification"" which was signed but not otherwise authenticated with a date or time of the signature.  The certificate had only limited information about the services to be provided, the benefits to be received, the risks of transfer or the relationship between risks and benefits.

The certificate notes the patient was transferred (""Mode of Transfer"") by ""Private Car"" and the first name of an individual was listed.  There is no notation that the listed individual was a family member or otherwise affiliated.

5.  A review of Patient 11's record indicated she was seen in the ED on 5/11/14 beginning at 3:15 pm with an initial complaint of abdominal pain following a VP shunt surgery. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is surgery to treat excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ([DIAGNOSES REDACTED]).  Patient 11's surgeon was contacted and requested a transfer to a higher level of care for evaluation.  Patient 11's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" for transfer that did not contain the reasons for transfer and was not signed by Patient 11 but instead signed by the physician.  Patient 11's record indicated that she was alert and oriented and did not have conditions which precluded her from signing the transfer form.  Patient 11's record also indicated that she had a family member present in the ED that could have signed for Patient 11 if she was unable to do so.

6.  On 6/3/14, Patient 15's record was reviewed.  Patient 15 was seen in the OB (obstetrical - for birthing) unit and found to have pre-eclampsia (a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure to both the mother and the fetus).  Patient 15's physician provided stabilizing treatment and arranged for transfer to a hospital with a higher level of care.  Patient 15's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" that did not include a detailed summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.

7.  On 6/3/14, Patient 16's record was reviewed.  Patient 16 was admitted on [DATE] in labor.  Patient 16 had been scheduled for a Cesarean section (delivery of the infant via the abdomen) at a hospital with a higher level of care on 1/23/14 due to fetal omphalocele (a high risk condition in which the stomach and other organs are on the outside of the body).  Patient 16's physician provided stabilizing treatment and arranged for transfer to the hospital above. Patient 16's record contained a ""Physician Certification"" that did not include a detailed summary of the risks and benefits of the transfer.

On 6/4/14, the hospital's policy, titled, ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act,"" dated 7/7/11, was reviewed.  The policy instructed the physician to complete the certification form but did not detail the required elements of a complete physician certification.

On 6/4/14 between 9:45 and 10:30 am, Patients 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16 were concurrently reviewed with the hospital's Vice-President of Medical Affairs (VPMA), and he acknowledged and concurred with the findings listed above.

VPMA also provided information about the two individuals that provided the transfer transportation for Patients 7, 8 and 10.  VPMA indicated these drivers were provided by a local mental-health care organization with which the hospital has an agreement.  This agreement or ""memorandum of agreement"" (MOU) was obtained and reviewed.  The MOU did not provide any information about the transfer services outlined above or the drivers that the organization provided.  The agreement did not have language that specified the mental-health care organization would ensure the provision of services that would allow the hospital to be in compliance with any regulations.  The VPMA stated that the hospital had no information to show that these drivers had received any specific training, were bonded or had other qualifications that would indicate they could provide appropriate and safe transportation for mental patients and/or patients that could be a danger to themselves or others.  The VPMA indicated that he understood the hospital was responsible for ensuring that emergent transfer services and all services provided by agreement are safe and effective.

BASED ON INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO ENSURE THAT SEVEN OF 10 SAMPLED  EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) PATIENTS (PATIENTS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, AND 16) WHO REQUIRED TRANSFER TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE FOR AN EMERGENT MEDICAL CONDITION (EMC) MET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN APPROPRIATE TRANSFER AS FOLLOWS:

1.  PATIENTS 7, 8, 9 AND 10'S ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" EMERGENCY TRANSFER FORM WAS NOT PROPERLY AUTHENTICATED WITH A DATE AND TIME OF THE PHYSICIAN'S SIGNATURE.

2.  PATIENTS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, AND 16'S, ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" DID NOT CONTAIN: 
*  A DESCRIPTION OF THE HIGHER LEVEL OF MEDICAL SERVICES THAT WOULD CAUSE THE PATIENT TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRANSFER,
*  THE MEDICAL BENEFITS REASONABLY EXPECTED FROM THE PROVISION OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES AVAILABLE AT THE RECEIVING FACILITY, AND THAT THOSE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE INCREASED RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL FROM BEING TRANSFERRED, AND
*  A SUMMARY OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS UPON WHICH THE CERTIFICATION WAS BASED.

3.  PATIENTS 7, 8, AND 10'S, ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" FORM CONTAINED INFORMATION THAT INDICATED THE PATIENTS HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED USING NON-QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND TRANSFER EQUIPMENT

THESE FAILURES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE DELAYS IN RECEIVING NEEDED CARE AND INAPPROPRIATE TRANSFERS TO ANOTHER FACILITY WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES INCLUDING DEATH.


FINDINGS:

1.  ON 6/4/14, THE RECORD OF PATIENT 7 WAS REVIEWED.  PATIENT 7 WAS SEEN IN THE ED ON 5/7/14 BEGINNING AT 7:37 PM WITH AN INITIAL COMPLAINT THAT SHE HAD THOUGHTS OF HARMING HERSELF.  IN THE ED, A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION (MSE) SHOWED PATIENT 7 DID HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION AND WAS AT RISK OF HARMING HERSELF.  PATIENT 7 HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN FOUND UNABLE TO CARE FOR HERSELF AND PLACED UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP.  PATIENT 7'S CONSERVATOR WAS CONTACTED AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO TRANSFER PATIENT 7 TO A PSYCHIATRIC CARE FACILITY. 

ON 5/9/14 AT OR NEAR 9:50 AM, PATIENT 7 WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY FOR DEFINITIVE CARE.  PATIENT 7'S RECORD CONTAINS A ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION (FOR EMERGENT TRANSFER)"" WHICH WAS SIGNED BUT NOT OTHERWISE AUTHENTICATED WITH A DATE OR TIME OF THE SIGNATURE.

2.  ON 6/4/14, THE RECORD OF PATIENT 8 WAS REVIEWED.  PATIENT 8 WAS BROUGHT TO THE ED ON 5/2/14 AT 10:43 AM BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH THE HISTORY OF THREATENING OTHERS AND HIMSELF.  IN THE ED, A MSE OF PATIENT 9 SHOWED HE DID HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION AND WAS AT RISK OF HARMING HIMSELF AND OTHERS.  BECAUSE OF THIS, PATIENT 8 WAS PLACED ON INVOLUNTARY PSYCHIATRIC HOLD (5150) AND PLANS WERE MADE TO TRANSFER HIM TO PSYCHIATRIC CARE SPECIALTY FACILITY IN A DISTANT COMMUNITY. 

AT 4:55 PM ON 5/2/14, PATIENT 8 WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTANT PSYCHIATRIC CARE FACILITY.  PATIENT 8?S RECORD CONTAINS A ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" WHICH WAS SIGNED BUT NOT OTHERWISE AUTHENTICATED WITH A DATE OR TIME OF THE SIGNATURE.

5.  A REVIEW OF PATIENT 11'S RECORD INDICATED SHE WAS SEEN IN THE ED ON 5/11/14 BEGINNING AT 3:15 PM WITH AN INITIAL COMPLAINT OF ABDOMINAL PAIN FOLLOWING A VP SHUNT SURGERY. VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNTING IS SURGERY TO TREAT EXCESS CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) IN THE BRAIN ([DIAGNOSES REDACTED]).  PATIENT 11'S SURGEON WAS CONTACTED AND REQUESTED A TRANSFER TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE FOR EVALUATION.  PATIENT 11'S RECORD CONTAINED A ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" FOR TRANSFER THAT DID NOT CONTAIN THE REASONS FOR TRANSFER AND WAS NOT SIGNED BY PATIENT 11 BUT INSTEAD SIGNED BY THE PHYSICIAN.  PATIENT 11'S RECORD INDICATED THAT SHE WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED AND DID NOT HAVE CONDITIONS WHICH PRECLUDED HER FROM SIGNING THE TRANSFER FORM.  PATIENT 11'S RECORD ALSO INDICATED THAT SHE HAD A FAMILY MEMBER PRESENT IN THE ED THAT COULD HAVE SIGNED FOR PATIENT 11 IF SHE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.

6.  ON 6/3/14, PATIENT 15'S RECORD WAS REVIEWED.  PATIENT 15 WAS SEEN IN THE OB (OBSTETRICAL - FOR BIRTHING) UNIT AND FOUND TO HAVE PRE-ECLAMPSIA (A DANGEROUS CONDITION INVOLVING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE TO BOTH THE MOTHER AND THE FETUS).  PATIENT 15'S PHYSICIAN PROVIDED STABILIZING TREATMENT AND ARRANGED FOR TRANSFER TO A HOSPITAL WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE.  PATIENT 15'S RECORD CONTAINED A ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" THAT DID NOT INCLUDE A DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER.

7.  ON 6/3/14, PATIENT 16'S RECORD WAS REVIEWED.  PATIENT 16 WAS ADMITTED ON [DATE] IN LABOR.  PATIENT 16 HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR A CESAREAN SECTION (DELIVERY OF THE INFANT VIA THE ABDOMEN) AT A HOSPITAL WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE ON 1/23/14 DUE TO FETAL OMPHALOCELE (A HIGH RISK CONDITION IN WHICH THE STOMACH AND OTHER ORGANS ARE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY).  PATIENT 16'S PHYSICIAN PROVIDED STABILIZING TREATMENT AND ARRANGED FOR TRANSFER TO THE HOSPITAL ABOVE. PATIENT 16'S RECORD CONTAINED A ""PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION"" THAT DID NOT INCLUDE A DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER.

ON 6/4/14, THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY, TITLED, ""EMTALA - EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND LABOR ACT,"" DATED 7/7/11, WAS REVIEWED.  THE POLICY INSTRUCTED THE PHYSICIAN TO COMPLETE THE CERTIFICATION FORM BUT DID NOT DETAIL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF A COMPLETE PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION.

ON 6/4/14 BETWEEN 9:45 AND 10:30 AM, PATIENTS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, AND 16 WERE CONCURRENTLY REVIEWED WITH THE HOSPITAL'S VICE-PRESIDENT OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS (VPMA), AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED AND CONCURRED WITH THE FINDINGS LISTED ABOVE.

VPMA ALSO PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDED THE TRANSFER TRANSPORTATION FOR PATIENTS 7, 8 AND 10.  VPMA INDICATED THESE DRIVERS WERE PROVIDED BY A LOCAL MENTAL-HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION WITH WHICH THE HOSPITAL HAS AN AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT OR ""MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT"" (MOU) WAS OBTAINED AND REVIEWED.

Based on record review, and interview, the hospital failed to ensure staff certified (documented specifics) that patients' medical benefits of medical treatment at receiving hospitals outweighed the risks associated with transfer to those hospital, for 5 of 24 sampled patients' medical records for which patients had not requested transfers, Patient 1, 9, 10, and 19.

For Patient 1, 10, and 19, the hospital failed to ensure medical records contained documentation that benefits outweigh the risks of transfer to receiving hospitals for treatment, and whether Patient 1, 10, and 19 requested the transfer to receiving hospitals for treatment.

For Patient 9, the hospital failed to ensure medical records contained documentation of specific risks that could result from transfer to receiving hospital for treatment, and whether Patient 9 requested the transfer or the hospital offered Patient 9 transfer to receiving hospital for treatment.

For an additional 1 of 24 sampled patients (Patient 17), the hospital failed to document specific risks of transferring to another facility, failed to document a physician certification that the benefits of transfer outweighed the risks, and had contradictory documentation regarding whether or not the patient's responsible party had requested the transfer.

This failure had a potential to deprive patients of information necessary to make informed decisions about their treatment, with potential for patients to make wrong decisions for wrong treatments, contributing to adverse events (unanticipated health care injuries) and compromising their health and safety.

_x000d_
Based on observation, interview, and record review, the facility (Facility A), failed to maintain an accurate central log for the Emergency Department (ED). The ED Central Log did not contain the name and disposition of one obstetric (OB) patient (Patient 1), who presented on   January 5, 2016, seeking assistance. As a result the facility was unable to track the care provided to Patient 1.

Findings:

On January 12, 2016, the record for Patient 1, obtained from Facility B, was reviewed. The record contained a copy of the ""OB Patient Registration Form,"" from Facility A. The Registration Form indicated Patient 1 presented to Facility A on January 5, 2016, at 1:45 a.m., with complaints of, ""A lot of pain/ pressure in lower stomic (stomach).""

On January 12, 2016, at 11:15 a.m., an unannounced visit was made to Facility A. The ED and OB Central Logs were reviewed. Patient 1 was not listed on either log.

On January 12, 2016, at 3 p.m., a copy of the ED security video for January 5, 2015, was reviewed with the Director of Security (DS) and the Director of Quality Services. The DS stated the time stamp on the video was 34 minutes fast. The video revealed the following:

- At 2:19 a.m. (actual time 1:45 a.m.), a man and a woman (who appeared to be pregnant) entered the ED. The security guard gave the woman paperwork to fill out, and assisted the woman into a wheelchair. The woman was next observed filling out the paperwork.

- At 2:24 a.m. (1:50 a.m.), the man handed the paperwork to a staff member (Patient Access Representative 1) observed sitting behind a semi circular desk in the lobby.

- At 2:27 a.m. (1:53 a.m.), Patient Access Representative (PAR) 1 gave the paperwork back to the couple and they went to sit in the waiting area.

- At 2:28 a.m. (1:54 a.m.), the man went back to the desk to talk to PAR 1.

- At 2:32 a.m. (1:58 a.m.), the man assisted the pregnant woman from the wheelchair and the couple left the ED.

On January 13, 2016, at 10:53 a.m., the Director of Patient Access (DPA) was interviewed. The DPA stated when an OB patient presented to the ED the PAR would do a quick registration on the patient and enter the patient into the computer. She stated at that time the patient's name would appear on the tracking board (electronic central log). The DPA stated if a patient left without being seen (LWBS) or left without being triaged (LWBT), the patient would still be on the electronic log, but be listed as LWBS or LWBT, so that it could be tracked.

On January 13, 2016, at 11:20 a.m., PAR 1 was interviewed. PAR 1 stated she was not a nurse and her job was not clinical. PAR 1 stated it was her job to register patients as they came in to the ED. However, PAR 1 stated,  if it was an OB patient, then she would not register them unless she knew for sure that the patient was going to have a baby. 

PAR 1 stated she would review the paperwork, to make sure everything was filled out, and then call the OB Department to report to them that an OB patient would be coming soon. She stated after the patient was seen in the OB department, then they would fax the registration form back to the PAR on duty, and the patient would be entered into the computer at that time.

PAR 1 stated she worked the night shift on January 5, 2016. PAR 1 stated she remembered Patient 1 and her boyfriend presented on   that night. PAR 1 stated Patient 1's boyfriend complained that Patient 1 was overdue and they hoped that she could be induced. PAR 1 stated she did not register Patient 1 into the computer, because she did not know if Patient 1 would be admitted     or not. PAR 1 stated she remembered that at some point Patient 1's boyfriend informed her that they were going to go to another hospital, and they left. PAR 1 added, it's the patients choice if they want to go somewhere else.

BASED ON OBSERVATION, INTERVIEW, AND RECORD REVIEW, THE FACILITY (FACILITY A), FAILED TO MAINTAIN AN ACCURATE CENTRAL LOG FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED). THE ED CENTRAL LOG DID NOT CONTAIN THE NAME AND DISPOSITION OF ONE OBSTETRIC (OB) PATIENT (PATIENT 1), WHO PRESENTED ON   JANUARY 5, 2016, SEEKING ASSISTANCE. AS A RESULT THE FACILITY WAS UNABLE TO TRACK THE CARE PROVIDED TO PATIENT 1.

FINDINGS:

ON JANUARY 12, 2016, THE RECORD FOR PATIENT 1, OBTAINED FROM FACILITY B, WAS REVIEWED. THE RECORD CONTAINED A COPY OF THE ""OB PATIENT REGISTRATION FORM,"" FROM FACILITY A. THE REGISTRATION FORM INDICATED PATIENT 1 PRESENTED TO FACILITY A ON JANUARY 5, 2016, AT 1:45 A.M., WITH COMPLAINTS OF, ""A LOT OF PAIN/ PRESSURE IN LOWER STOMIC (STOMACH).""

ON JANUARY 12, 2016, AT 11:15 A.M., AN UNANNOUNCED VISIT WAS MADE TO FACILITY A. THE ED AND OB CENTRAL LOGS WERE REVIEWED. PATIENT 1 WAS NOT LISTED ON EITHER LOG.

ON JANUARY 12, 2016, AT 3 P.M., A COPY OF THE ED SECURITY VIDEO FOR JANUARY 5, 2015, WAS REVIEWED WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SECURITY (DS) AND THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY SERVICES. THE DS STATED THE TIME STAMP ON THE VIDEO WAS 34 MINUTES FAST. THE VIDEO REVEALED THE FOLLOWING:

- AT 2:19 A.M. (ACTUAL TIME 1:45 A.M.), A MAN AND A WOMAN (WHO APPEARED TO BE PREGNANT) ENTERED THE ED. THE SECURITY GUARD GAVE THE WOMAN PAPERWORK TO FILL OUT, AND ASSISTED THE WOMAN INTO A WHEELCHAIR. THE WOMAN WAS NEXT OBSERVED FILLING OUT THE PAPERWORK.

- AT 2:24 A.M. (1:50 A.M.), THE MAN HANDED THE PAPERWORK TO A STAFF MEMBER (PATIENT ACCESS REPRESENTATIVE 1) OBSERVED SITTING BEHIND A SEMI CIRCULAR DESK IN THE LOBBY.

- AT 2:27 A.M. (1:53 A.M.), PATIENT ACCESS REPRESENTATIVE (PAR) 1 GAVE THE PAPERWORK BACK TO THE COUPLE AND THEY WENT TO SIT IN THE WAITING AREA.

- AT 2:28 A.M. (1:54 A.M.), THE MAN WENT BACK TO THE DESK TO TALK TO PAR 1.

- AT 2:32 A.M. (1:58 A.M.), THE MAN ASSISTED THE PREGNANT WOMAN FROM THE WHEELCHAIR AND THE COUPLE LEFT THE ED.

ON JANUARY 13, 2016, AT 10:53 A.M., THE DIRECTOR OF PATIENT ACCESS (DPA) WAS INTERVIEWED. THE DPA STATED WHEN AN OB PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE ED THE PAR WOULD DO A QUICK REGISTRATION ON THE PATIENT AND ENTER THE PATIENT INTO THE COMPUTER. SHE STATED AT THAT TIME THE PATIENT'S NAME WOULD APPEAR ON THE TRACKING BOARD (ELECTRONIC CENTRAL LOG). THE DPA STATED IF A PATIENT LEFT WITHOUT BEING SEEN (LWBS) OR LEFT WITHOUT BEING TRIAGED (LWBT), THE PATIENT WOULD STILL BE ON THE ELECTRONIC LOG, BUT BE LISTED AS LWBS OR LWBT, SO THAT IT COULD BE TRACKED.

ON JANUARY 13, 2016, AT 11:20 A.M., PAR 1 WAS INTERVIEWED. PAR 1 STATED SHE WAS NOT A NURSE AND HER JOB WAS NOT CLINICAL. PAR 1 STATED IT WAS HER JOB TO REGISTER PATIENTS AS THEY CAME IN TO THE ED. HOWEVER, PAR 1 STATED,  IF IT WAS AN OB PATIENT, THEN SHE WOULD NOT REGISTER THEM UNLESS SHE KNEW FOR SURE THAT THE PATIENT WAS GOING TO HAVE A BABY. 

PAR 1 STATED SHE WOULD REVIEW THE PAPERWORK, TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS FILLED OUT, AND THEN CALL THE OB DEPARTMENT TO REPORT TO THEM THAT AN OB PATIENT WOULD BE COMING SOON. SHE STATED AFTER THE PATIENT WAS SEEN IN THE OB DEPARTMENT, THEN THEY WOULD FAX THE REGISTRATION FORM BACK TO THE PAR ON DUTY, AND THE PATIENT WOULD BE ENTERED INTO THE COMPUTER AT THAT TIME.

PAR 1 STATED SHE WORKED THE NIGHT SHIFT ON JANUARY 5, 2016. PAR 1 STATED SHE REMEMBERED PATIENT 1 AND HER BOYFRIEND PRESENTED ON   THAT NIGHT. PAR 1 STATED PATIENT 1'S BOYFRIEND COMPLAINED THAT PATIENT 1 WAS OVERDUE AND THEY HOPED THAT SHE COULD BE INDUCED. PAR 1 STATED SHE DID NOT REGISTER PATIENT 1 INTO THE COMPUTER, BECAUSE SHE DID NOT KNOW IF PATIENT 1 WOULD BE ADMITTED     OR NOT. PAR 1 STATED SHE REMEMBERED THAT AT SOME POINT PATIENT 1'S BOYFRIEND INFORMED HER THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL, AND THEY LEFT.

Based on observation, interviews and record review, the hospital failed to comply with CFR 489.24, the EMTALA requirements when the facility failed to ensure:

1.   One of 29 sampled patients (Patient 1) was triaged appropriately in order to determine the presence of an emergent condition therefore delaying the completion of a timely Medical Screening Exam (MSE) when Patient 1 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on 11/29/10 at 1:39 p.m. 

2.   Provide evidence that 8 of 8 Registered Nurses in Labor and Delivery (RN4, RN5, RN6, RN7, RN8, RN9, RN10, RN11) had completed an annual skills review to determine competency to provide a MSE to patients presenting to the Obstetrical Department for assessment of active labor. 

Findings:

Patient 1, a two year old, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) from an Urgent Care Clinic (UCC) on 11/29/10 at 1:39 p.m. with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat and earache for two days. Patient 1 had been seen immediately prior in a nearby UCC with a recommendation to go to the ED to rule out meningitis. In a form identified by Registration staff as the facility facesheet (a summary of patient history and demographics) of Patient 1 the chief complaint was noted to be ""rule out meningitis, vomiting"". 

In an interview with the physician (DO1) who treated Patient 1 at the UCC on 11/29/10 at 12:57 p.m., he stated he recalled Patient 1. He said Patient 1 was only at the UCC for a short time (""five to ten minutes at the most"") as he felt it was ""crucial"" for her to be seen in the ED immediately. DO1 stated he was concerned regarding the high fever (103F) and the petechial rashes (spots caused by bleeding under the skin) on both cheeks. He described the rash as ""purpural"" (purplish spots or patches on the skin due to bleeding within the skin, do  not change color under direct pressure). DO1 stated it ""looked like a [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [an acute infection of the bloodstream] rash"". DO1 stated he completed a referral form addressed to the ED physician that described the complaints as ""fever, petechial rash on face, lethargy and headache"" and recommended Patient 1 undergo further evaluation to ""rule out meningitis"". He further stated he told the Patient 1's parents of the need to rule out meningitis and gave them a copy of the referral form.

In a concurrent review of a form titled Urgent Care and addressed Dear ER  Physician, Patient 1 was noted to have been seen at the clinic with complaints of ""fever, petechial rash, lethargy and headache"" with a ""fever 103"". DO1 acknowledged he had signed the form with a documented recommendation to ""rule out meningitis"".

In an interview with a Registration Clerk (RC1) on 1/18/11 at 12 p.m., he stated that when someone was admitted     through the ED, they have ""the person write down on a slip of paper [identified by Registration staff as the Emergency Department Sign-In Slip] what the main problem is"". RC1 stated if the patient brought a referral form from a physician office or clinic, the referral form would be given back to the patient and he would let the triage nurse know there was a referral. When RC1 was asked to read what the UCC physician had recommended for Patient 1, he stated ""the doctor ruled out meningitis, fever 103"". When asked to repeat this statement, he repeated, ""the doctor ruled out meningitis, fever 103"". RC1 stated there was no facility policy on what to report to the triage nurse regarding any chief complaints or referrals. 

In an interview with a Registration Clerk (RC2), she acknowledged she was the Registration Clerk who had completed a stat registration for Patient 1 on 11/29/10 at 1:39 p.m. RC2 stated she was training with RC1 at that time and had been working in the ED for a week and a half following eight days in Admitting. RC2 stated ""the patient fills out a piece of paper with their problem and I type it into the computer"" (identified as the ED Sign-In Slip). RC2 also stated ""If they come with a paper from Urgent Care, I would let triage know immediately if needed"". RC2 also stated ""I would tell the patient to hold on to the form and give it to the doctor"". RC2 stated there was no policy to guide the registration clerks on potential emergent conditions or what to report to the triage nurse regarding a referral form. RC2 stated the ED Sign-In Slip would be placed with the chart labels in an area designated for the triage nurse to retrieve.

In review of a form titled Emergency Department Sign-In Slip dated 11/29/10 at 1:21 p.m., Patient 1's chief complaint was documented by the family member as ""skin changing color, throwing up, 102 temp"".

Patient 1 was triaged in the ED by a licensed nurse (RN1) at 1:56 p.m. and assigned to a Level 3 or Urgent status. In a review of the ED Triage Form, RN1 noted the chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, fever, sore throat and ear pain for two days. RN1 documented Patient 1's respirations were 32 breaths per minute and described in a concurrent narrative  ""respirations regular and unlabored"". In a further assessment, RN1 described Patient 1's skin as ""warm and dry"" and in a section designated for Skin Integrity Major Factors, noted ""none"".  The vital signs documented at the time of triage were: heart rate 160 H, respirations 32 H, temperature 39.0 H. (The computer program was set up to use H to define a higher value than normal) There was no documentation of Patient 1's blood pressure or capillary refill assessment (measurement of adequacy of circulation) at the time of triage or throughout the ED stay until discharge. There was no documentation the physician had been notified of the elevated heart rate, temperature and respirations. There was no assessment of pain or any GI (gastrointestinal) problems i.e. vomiting. There was no reference to any rash or bruising on the face or body.  

In an interview with RN1 on 1/20/11 at 2:10 p.m., he stated he was assigned as the Triage Nurse on the day shift (7a-7p) on 11/29/10 but had ""no specific recollection"" of Patient 1. RN1 did not recall being given a referral letter from the UCC but stated that if he had, it would have been ""entered into the triage notes"" and ""put into the chart"". RN1 stated, in general, the communication between Registration and the Triage Nurse was ""hit and miss"" and there were often ""errors"" in information entered by Registration staff therefore it was important to see the patient as soon as possible to ""seek out errors"". RN1 stated when he was assigned to triage he does not undress a child to check for rashes unless indicated. RN1 did not recall reviewing the ED Sign-In Slip that noted the ""skin changing color"". RN1 acknowledged the surge in the ED (a large number of patients presenting during the same time period) may have impacted his ability to perform timely re-assessments. When RN1 was asked if he was familiar with the Pediatric Fever assessment criteria located on a flip card index for triage nurses, he stated ""I've seen it before"". When asked why he did not check for capillary refill due to Patient 1's fever, he stated capillary refill was ""done at the bedside"". Further in the interview, RN1 stated again ""capillary refill is a bedside procedure, not done in triage"". RN1 stated there was ""no box"" on the computerized medical record to record a capillary refill. 

In further review of the medical record, there was inconsistent documentation of Patient 1's vital signs and re-assessments related to the chief complaint and symptoms from 1:56 p.m. until  Patient 1 was transferred at 10:34 p.m. (There was no documentation in the medical record to reflect the time Patient 1 was placed in an ED bed)

1.	Temperatures were documented at 1:46 p.m., (102.2F),  3:35 p.m. (102.5F (90 minutes after tylenol), 5:29 p.m. (100.4F) and 9 p.m. (99.1F)  
     The policy for re-assessments was 30 minutes for emergent or abnormal or 60 minutes for urgent.
2.	Heart rates were documented at 1:46 p.m. (160), 5:29 p.m. (122), 6:30 p.m. (140), and 9 p.m. (113).  
     The policy for re-assessments was 30 minutes for emergent or abnormal or 60 minutes for urgent.
3.	Respirations were documented at 1:46 p.m. (32), 5:29 p.m. (28), 6:30 p.m. (24) and 9 p.m. (24).  
     The policy for re-assessments was 30 minutes for emergent or abnormal or 60 minutes for urgent.
4.	Blood pressure - none noted throughout stay   
5.	Capillary refill done only prior to transfer  
6.	Central pulses - none noted throughout stay 
7.   There was no documentation of any intake or output (to rule out dehydration)
8.   There was no re-assessement of pain following the administration of two doses of morphine.

In review of an area designated for ED Physical Assessment, RN2 noted respiratory efforts as regular and unlabored at 5:38 p.m. There was no evidence of any prior or further nursing physical assessments by RN2. 

In an interview with RN2 on 1/20/10 at 9:10 a.m., he stated he recalled Patient 1 as it was an ""extremely busy day"" with ""parades of ambulances"" and ""lots in the waiting room"". RN2 stated he never received any communication from triage during Patient 1's wait in the ED and he did not receive a report from the TN when Patient 1 was placed in a bed in the ED. RN2 further stated ""I am unaware of patients until they land in my room"". RN2 stated he does not know the assigned triage level of patients until ""I look it up"" and ""do my own assessment"". RN2 stated Patient 1 was ""not as animated as a two year old should be"" and was just ""laying still which is not normal for a two year old"". RN2 stated he was ""struck by her non-resistance"". RN 2 stated Patient 1 ""continued to moan when she nodded on and off"". RN2 stated Patient 1 was fully dressed and he ""opened and peeked"" beneath her clothing. RN2 stated Patient 1's ""whole body was purpura"" which he further described as ""appeared bruised uniformly"". RN2 stated the bruising on Patient 1's face looked like rosacea (a skin condition characterized by redness or pimples) but the color was purple. RN2 stated he was not given and did not see a referral form from the physician at the UCC. RN2 stated he informed PA2 ""in passing"" that he had ""a very sick child"" but did not recall how much time passed before PA2 initially saw the child at the bedside. RN2 stated he was ""constantly"" re-assessing Patient 1 but acknowledged that with his additional work load he did not have the time to document his assessments or re-assessments. 

In review of a policy titled emergency room    Triage, no date, the five classifications to determine the priority of care were defined:

Level 1: RESUSCITATION  Conditions that are threats to life or limb requiring immediate aggressive interventions. **THE ED MD IS IMMEDIATELY INFORMED OF ALL PATIENTS**

Level 2: EMERGENT  Conditions that are a potential threat to life, limb or function. Requires rapid medical intervention or delegated acts. **THE ED MD IS IMMEDIATELY 
INFORMED OF ALL EMERGENCY PATIENTS**

Level 3: URGENT  Condition that could potentially progress to a serious problem requiring emergency intervention. 

Level 4: DELAYED Conditions that when related to patient age, distress or potential for deterioration and/or complications would benefit from intervention or reassurance.
	 
Level 5: MINOR  Conditions that may be acute but non-urgent as well as chronic problems with or without evidence of deterioration.

This policy did not stipulate time frames for the patient to be seen by the physician or PA at each of the five levels of care. 

In review of the Triage Reassessment Guidelines, an addendum to the emergency room    Triage policy, there was stipulation the reassessment times were determined by the level assigned and would include a re-assessment of the chief complaint, any change in condition, a re-assessment of any abnormal vital signs and response to medication or treatment. The policy further stated ""All re-assessments are to be documented on the ED record"" and ""all abnormal vital signs will be brought to the attention of the Emergency Department Provider and will be repeated within 30 minutes"".

1.  Level 1 	Resuscitation    Every 5 minutes*
2.  Level 2 	Emergent  	Every 15 minutes*
3.  Level 3 	Urgent  	Every 60 minutes
4.  Level 4 	Delayed  	Every 90 minutes
5.  Level 5 	Minor 	 	Every 120 minutes

* Resuscitation and Emergency patients will be placed into a treatment area and the reassessments will be completed at the bedside by the primary RN in accordance with the policy Assessment and Reassessment.

In review of an undated facility policy titled Patient Assessment/Reassessment and Care Planning, no date, the re-assessment of ED patients was defined as:
"" Reassessment is determined by Triage Classification, related to chief complaint and symptoms. At the time of re-assessment, all abnormal vital signs will be reported to the ED provider and repeated within 30 minutes."" The minimum time frame requirements for reassessment were the same as defined in the Triage Reassessment Guidelines.

In review of an index card titled Pediatric Fever, dated 12-05, an assessment tool used by the TN to determine the level of care to be assigned, there was stipulation to evaluate capillary refill, central pulses, presence of headache and purpura to determine if the level of care was Emergent.  There was no evidence RN1 had assessed or re-assessed Patient 1 appropriately to determine an emergent versus an urgent condition was present.

In review of a Standardized Procedure titled Pediatric Fever Management in Triage, revised 07/09, there was criteria to prompt the triage nurse to notify the ED provider to see the patient immediately for many factors including:
1.	Fever >38.3 with history of high risk factors
4.   Rash with purple or red spots or dots
5.   Inconsolable crying
8.	Abnormal or unexplained bruising
10.   Behavior changes
11.  Somnolence or confusion
12.  Difficult to arouse or unresponsive
13.  Limp, weak or not moving
14.  Dehydration

In an interview with a Physician Assistant (PA1) on 1/20/11 at 4:10 p.m., he stated he was the first provider to see Patient 1. PA1 stated ""I was asked to go into the triage area and assess things ""due to a surge"". PA1 stated he was assigned to be the PIT (Provider in Triage) on 11/29/10 at approximately 1 p.m. and he was assisting the TN with the re-assessment of patients in the waiting areas. During the interview, PA1 identified an untitled, undated form with a time noted as 3:35 p.m., as his PIT notes. PA1 defined the form as his ""PIT notes"" (Provider in Triage) and acknowledged ""there were no notes from me"" on this form for the assessment of Patient 1 (the sections noted for history and physical, impession and condition were left blank). In a review of this form there were orders documented for ""Zofran, p.o.[oral] fluids"". PA1 recalled ordering the Zofran as Patient 1's family had said she had been vomiting prior to the ED visit. PA1 stated ""if she still vomits it would indicate how sick she is"". PA1 stated Patient 1 was ""ruddy cheeked"" but ""not outside normal"". PA1 stated he did not undress the child to examine Patient 1's body further and did not perform a physical assessment. PA1 described Patient 1 as an ""unremarkable, ill child"". PA1 did not recall seeing the referral letter from the UCC physician. 

In review of an untitled form acknowledged by PA2 as the MSE, dated 11/29/10 at 4:48 p.m. and co-signed by PA2 and the ED physician (MD1), PA2 noted Patient 1 had bruising on her cheeks, ear lobes and over her body which the parents stated had started the prior evening. PA2 documented Patient 1 had complained of a sore throat and earache and had a fever for two days. PA2 documented she had consulted with the physician regarding Patient 1 but the date and time space on the form was left blank. 

In an interview with PA2 on 1/20/11 at 10 a.m., she stated she was walking past the ""hall chairs"" about four hours after Patient 1's arrival to the ED and was confronted by Patient 1's father who stated he ""had been waiting a long time"". PA2 stated the father told her his child was sick and inquired how long it might be before she would be seen. PA2 stated ""I knew she needed a room"" and started caring for Patient 1 immediately. PA2 stated Patient 1 was warm and crying. PA2 stated she noted ""bruising"" on Patient 1's cheeks, ears and legs and revealed ""it was extensive enough to concern me"". PA2 stated the ""bruising"" was ""not a rash"" and it was ""non-blanchable"". PA2 described the bruising further as patches and called it ""purpural"".  PA2 stated the bruising was ""more intense"" on the extremities. She further stated from ""far away"" she might look ""flushed"", but ""not if examined closely"" and...""it didn't blanch"". PA2 stated Patient 1 was ""roomed"" (taken to an ED bed) about 20 minutes later and she immediately notified one of the ED physicians (MD1) to see the patient. PA2 stated MD1 assumed the care of Patient 1 ""when the labs came back"".  PA2 stated she never received any communication from the TN or PA1 regarding Patient 1. PA2 stated the family ""did not give me a letter from Urgent Care, but communicated clearly they were here to rule out meningitis"".  

In review of a dictated report dated 11/29/10 at 9:34 p.m., MD1 documented Patient 1 to have slight jaundice (yellow coloring) of the skin with bruising on the cheeks, earlobes, thorax, buttocks and lower extremities. MD1 documented the results of blood tests done, including abnormal liver tests, and recommended Patient 1 be transferred to another facility for ""further intensive care"".

In an interview with MD1 on 1/21/11 at 1 p.m., he stated PA2 ""probably saw the child around 5:30 or so"" and ""got me involved about 6 p.m"". MD1 stated he observed ""bruising"" and called it ""disturbing purpura"". MD1 revealed he had never been informed of or given a letter of referral from the UCC physician. MD1 stated he assessed Patient 1, reviewed the results of the laboratory tests and made direct contact with a pediatric intensive care specialist to prepare for transfer. MD1 stated ""I would have loved to have had the kid in front of me hours earlier"". 

In review of a policy titled Administrative Policy, EMTALA, REVISED 4/2008, the role of the physician in performing the MSE was defined. The policy, however, did not stipulate the anticipated time for the patient to be seen by the physician or PA for the different triage levels assigned (1 through 5). 

In a further review of this policy there was definition of the Triage Assessment. The policy stipulated an initial assessment would be performed within 15 minutes of the arrival of every patient and a complete triage assessment would be conducted as soon as possible. The policy noted the complete assessment would determine the accuracy of the chief complaint, the physical findings, vital signs and past medical history. The policy stipulated, when applicable, the Standardized Procedure for Pediatric Fever would be initiated. The policy stipulated complete reassessments of waiting patients would be based on the chief complaint and triage classification. The policy referred to the Reassessment Guidelines for further reference.

In an Initial Tour of the ED with the Director of Emergency Services (DES) on 1/18/11 at 
10:40 a.m., the waiting room, registration, triage and patient care areas were observed. The DES stated there were 23 beds in the ED and the average number of patients seen was 4500 per month. The DES stated on 11/29/10 there was one TN assigned and the triage room and registration clerk were located next to each other in one central area. The DES stated a ""stat"" (immediate) registration was done at the time the patient arrived with the name, date of birth and chief complaint obtained in order to begin the medical record. The DES stated prior to 12/15/10, the ED Sign-In Slip completed by the patient or designee would be passed on to the Triage Nurse with the patient's ""stickers"" (labels to be placed on the record for patient identification). The DES stated all nurses working in the ED (except orientees or preceptors) were assigned to triage. She stated nurses hired without triage experience took a class during orientation and experienced nurses were oriented in the triage area. The DES stated there was no competency or annual competency review or any ongoing training for triage nurses as they were only assigning the acuity of the patient, not participating in the MSE. The DES also stated there was no ongoing training for the management of pediatric patients with the exception of PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) certification. There were no ED policies or guidelines for the stipulation of training requirements for triage nurses.    

In an interview with the DES on 1/20/11 at 3:10 p.m., she demonstrated the computerized medical record for the ED which included a prompt to be used for pediatric patients. The DES acknowledged RN1 had not activated the prompt and therefore had not seen the screen for the assessment of a pediatric patient. The DES also acknowledged RN1 had not accessed the appropriate screen for assessing pain for a child. The DES stated at the time of Patient 1's visit there was no box for recording the capillary refill but stated this should have been documented in a narrative. The DES also revealed there was no ED surge plan to be implemented when ED was at maximum census and wait times were long.

2.  During an Initial Tour on 1/18/11, the Director of Womens' and Childrens' Services (DWCS) stated there were approximately 100 births a month in the Family Birth Center (FBC). The DWCS stated patients were instructed to come directly to the FBC unless the main entrance was locked in which case they would enter the facility through the ED. ED staff would then send them directly to the FBC where they were to be immediately assessed by a labor and delivery RN in the FBC Triage Room. The DWCS stated the medical staff had delegated the responsibility of assessing the competency of the labor and delivery nurse to the labor and delivery nurse manager.  The standardized procedure was reviewed annually by the Interdisciplinary Practice Committee, OB Committee and the Medical Executive Committee.

In review of the Medical Staff Rules & Regulations, Emergency Care and Services - Qualified Medical Personnel, approved 7/30/09, there was stipulation all patients who present to the hospital including... the Emergency Department and the Labor and Delivery unit, and who request an examination and treatment for...active labor, shall be evaluated for the existence of...active labor. This screening exam may be performed by the following persons:

""2. In the Labor and Delivery Unit: by either a Physician or by a registered nurse (RN) who has been determined by the L&D nurse manager to be qualified and experienced in obstetrical nursing and who is required to follow standardized procedures approved by the Medical Staff.""

In review of an FBC policy titled Medical Screening Exam (OB) Standardized Procedure, revised 10/08, there was stipulation for the Initial Competency Validation and an Ongoing Competency Validation. Both validations required an annual review of skills with completion of a written post test. The policy further stipulated: A list of RN's authorized to perform this standardized procedure will be maintained in Nursing Administration.

In an interview with RN3 on 1/18/11 at 11 a.m., she stated that all of the labor and delivery nurses have been trained to triage obstetrical patients and there was an annual exam for competency. RN3 provided a copy of the OB Triage Record and stated the assessment included a non-stress test (monitoring the status of the fetus and the contractions of the uterus) and a cervical exam when indicated.

In an interview with the DWCS on 1/18/11 at 11:30 a.m., the DWCS was unable to provide evidence of the annual competency training or test results for the labor and delivery nurses (RN4, RN5, RN6) who triaged the three obstetrical patients reviewed (Patients 6, 7, 8). The DWCS stated the record keeping had been disorganized and some of the nurses had not turned in their paperwork.

In an interview on 1/21/11 at 11 a.m., the DWCS was unable to produce evidence that five of five nurses (RN7, RN8, RN9, RN10, RN11) working in labor and delivery that shift had completed the annual competency evaluation for the MSE in 2010. The DWCS stated the former manager had not maintained the records where they were readily retrievable and she could not locate any of the files for the annual competency for labor and delivery nurses. The DWCS was able to produce competencies for the five nurses which had been done in January of 2011 but the dates were outside of the window of review for the survey (July through December)

BASED ON OBSERVATION, INTERVIEWS AND RECORD REVIEW, THE HOSPITAL FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CFR 489.24, THE EMTALA REQUIREMENTS WHEN THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE:

1.   ONE OF 29 SAMPLED PATIENTS (PATIENT 1) WAS TRIAGED APPROPRIATELY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF AN EMERGENT CONDITION THEREFORE DELAYING THE COMPLETION OF A TIMELY MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM (MSE) WHEN PATIENT 1 PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) ON 11/29/10 AT 1:39 P.M. 

2.   PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT 8 OF 8 REGISTERED NURSES IN LABOR AND DELIVERY (RN4, RN5, RN6, RN7, RN8, RN9, RN10, RN11) HAD COMPLETED AN ANNUAL SKILLS REVIEW TO DETERMINE COMPETENCY TO PROVIDE A MSE TO PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE OBSTETRICAL DEPARTMENT FOR ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVE LABOR. 

FINDINGS:

PATIENT 1, A TWO YEAR OLD, PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) FROM AN URGENT CARE CLINIC (UCC) ON 11/29/10 AT 1:39 P.M. WITH A CHIEF COMPLAINT OF NAUSEA, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, SORE THROAT AND EARACHE FOR TWO DAYS. PATIENT 1 HAD BEEN SEEN IMMEDIATELY PRIOR IN A NEARBY UCC WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO GO TO THE ED TO RULE OUT MENINGITIS. IN A FORM IDENTIFIED BY REGISTRATION STAFF AS THE FACILITY FACESHEET (A SUMMARY OF PATIENT HISTORY AND DEMOGRAPHICS) OF PATIENT 1 THE CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS NOTED TO BE ""RULE OUT MENINGITIS, VOMITING"". 

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PHYSICIAN (DO1) WHO TREATED PATIENT 1 AT THE UCC ON 11/29/10 AT 12:57 P.M., HE STATED HE RECALLED PATIENT 1. HE SAID PATIENT 1 WAS ONLY AT THE UCC FOR A SHORT TIME (""FIVE TO TEN MINUTES AT THE MOST"") AS HE FELT IT WAS ""CRUCIAL"" FOR HER TO BE SEEN IN THE ED IMMEDIATELY. DO1 STATED HE WAS CONCERNED REGARDING THE HIGH FEVER (103F) AND THE PETECHIAL RASHES (SPOTS CAUSED BY BLEEDING UNDER THE SKIN) ON BOTH CHEEKS. HE DESCRIBED THE RASH AS ""PURPURAL"" (PURPLISH SPOTS OR PATCHES ON THE SKIN DUE TO BLEEDING WITHIN THE SKIN, DO  NOT CHANGE COLOR UNDER DIRECT PRESSURE). DO1 STATED IT ""LOOKED LIKE A [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] [AN ACUTE INFECTION OF THE BLOODSTREAM] RASH"". DO1 STATED HE COMPLETED A REFERRAL FORM ADDRESSED TO THE ED PHYSICIAN THAT DESCRIBED THE COMPLAINTS AS ""FEVER, PETECHIAL RASH ON FACE, LETHARGY AND HEADACHE"" AND RECOMMENDED PATIENT 1 UNDERGO FURTHER EVALUATION TO ""RULE OUT MENINGITIS"". HE FURTHER STATED HE TOLD THE PATIENT 1'S PARENTS OF THE NEED TO RULE OUT MENINGITIS AND GAVE THEM A COPY OF THE REFERRAL FORM.

IN A CONCURRENT REVIEW OF A FORM TITLED URGENT CARE AND ADDRESSED DEAR ER  PHYSICIAN, PATIENT 1 WAS NOTED TO HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE CLINIC WITH COMPLAINTS OF ""FEVER, PETECHIAL RASH, LETHARGY AND HEADACHE"" WITH A ""FEVER 103"". DO1 ACKNOWLEDGED HE HAD SIGNED THE FORM WITH A DOCUMENTED RECOMMENDATION TO ""RULE OUT MENINGITIS"".

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH A REGISTRATION CLERK (RC1) ON 1/18/11 AT 12 P.M., HE STATED THAT WHEN SOMEONE WAS ADMITTED     THROUGH THE ED, THEY HAVE ""THE PERSON WRITE DOWN ON A SLIP OF PAPER [IDENTIFIED BY REGISTRATION STAFF AS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SIGN-IN SLIP] WHAT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS"". RC1 STATED IF THE PATIENT BROUGHT A REFERRAL FORM FROM A PHYSICIAN OFFICE OR CLINIC, THE REFERRAL FORM WOULD BE GIVEN BACK TO THE PATIENT AND HE WOULD LET THE TRIAGE NURSE KNOW THERE WAS A REFERRAL. WHEN RC1 WAS ASKED TO READ WHAT THE UCC PHYSICIAN HAD RECOMMENDED FOR PATIENT 1, HE STATED ""THE DOCTOR RULED OUT MENINGITIS, FEVER 103"". WHEN ASKED TO REPEAT THIS STATEMENT, HE REPEATED, ""THE DOCTOR RULED OUT MENINGITIS, FEVER 103"". RC1 STATED THERE WAS NO FACILITY POLICY ON WHAT TO REPORT TO THE TRIAGE NURSE REGARDING ANY CHIEF COMPLAINTS OR REFERRALS. 

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH A REGISTRATION CLERK (RC2), SHE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS THE REGISTRATION CLERK WHO HAD COMPLETED A STAT REGISTRATION FOR PATIENT 1 ON 11/29/10 AT 1:39 P.M. RC2 STATED SHE WAS TRAINING WITH RC1 AT THAT TIME AND HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE ED FOR A WEEK AND A HALF FOLLOWING EIGHT DAYS IN ADMITTING. RC2 STATED ""THE PATIENT FILLS OUT A PIECE OF PAPER WITH THEIR PROBLEM AND I TYPE IT INTO THE COMPUTER"" (IDENTIFIED AS THE ED SIGN-IN SLIP). RC2 ALSO STATED ""IF THEY COME WITH A PAPER FROM URGENT CARE, I WOULD LET TRIAGE KNOW IMMEDIATELY IF NEEDED"". RC2 ALSO STATED ""I WOULD TELL THE PATIENT TO HOLD ON TO THE FORM AND GIVE IT TO THE DOCTOR"". RC2 STATED THERE WAS NO POLICY TO GUIDE THE REGISTRATION CLERKS ON POTENTIAL EMERGENT CONDITIONS OR WHAT TO REPORT TO THE TRIAGE NURSE REGARDING A REFERRAL FORM. RC2 STATED THE ED SIGN-IN SLIP WOULD BE PLACED WITH THE CHART LABELS IN AN AREA DESIGNATED FOR THE TRIAGE NURSE TO RETRIEVE.

IN REVIEW OF A FORM TITLED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SIGN-IN SLIP DATED 11/29/10 AT 1:21 P.M., PATIENT 1'S CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS DOCUMENTED BY THE FAMILY MEMBER AS ""SKIN CHANGING COLOR, THROWING UP, 102 TEMP"".

PATIENT 1 WAS TRIAGED IN THE ED BY A LICENSED NURSE (RN1) AT 1:56 P.M. AND ASSIGNED TO A LEVEL 3 OR URGENT STATUS. IN A REVIEW OF THE ED TRIAGE FORM, RN1 NOTED THE CHIEF COMPLAINT OF NAUSEA, VOMITING, FEVER, SORE THROAT AND EAR PAIN FOR TWO DAYS. RN1 DOCUMENTED PATIENT 1'S RESPIRATIONS WERE 32 BREATHS PER MINUTE AND DESCRIBED IN A CONCURRENT NARRATIVE  ""RESPIRATIONS REGULAR AND UNLABORED"". IN A FURTHER ASSESSMENT, RN1 DESCRIBED PATIENT 1'S SKIN AS ""WARM AND DRY"" AND IN A SECTION DESIGNATED FOR SKIN INTEGRITY MAJOR FACTORS, NOTED ""NONE"".  THE VITAL SIGNS DOCUMENTED AT THE TIME OF TRIAGE WERE: HEART RATE 160 H, RESPIRATIONS 32 H, TEMPERATURE 39.0 H. (THE COMPUTER PROGRAM WAS SET UP TO USE H TO DEFINE A HIGHER VALUE THAN NORMAL) THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION OF PATIENT 1'S BLOOD PRESSURE OR CAPILLARY REFILL ASSESSMENT (MEASUREMENT OF ADEQUACY OF CIRCULATION) AT THE TIME OF TRIAGE OR THROUGHOUT THE ED STAY UNTIL DISCHARGE. THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION THE PHYSICIAN HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE ELEVATED HEART RATE, TEMPERATURE AND RESPIRATIONS. THERE WAS NO ASSESSMENT OF PAIN OR ANY GI (GASTROINTESTINAL) PROBLEMS I.E. VOMITING. THERE WAS NO REFERENCE TO ANY RASH OR BRUISING ON THE FACE OR BODY.  

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH RN1 ON 1/20/11 AT 2:10 P.M., HE STATED HE WAS ASSIGNED AS THE TRIAGE NURSE ON THE DAY SHIFT (7A-7P) ON 11/29/10 BUT HAD ""NO SPECIFIC RECOLLECTION"" OF PATIENT 1. RN1 DID NOT RECALL BEING GIVEN A REFERRAL LETTER FROM THE UCC BUT STATED THAT IF HE HAD, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ""ENTERED INTO THE TRIAGE NOTES"" AND ""PUT INTO THE CHART"". RN1 STATED, IN GENERAL, THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN REGISTRATION AND THE TRIAGE NURSE WAS ""HIT AND MISS"" AND THERE WERE OFTEN ""ERRORS"" IN INFORMATION ENTERED BY REGISTRATION STAFF THEREFORE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SEE THE PATIENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ""SEEK OUT ERRORS"". RN1 STATED WHEN HE WAS ASSIGNED TO TRIAGE HE DOES NOT UNDRESS A CHILD TO CHECK FOR RASHES UNLESS INDICATED. RN1 DID NOT RECALL REVIEWING THE ED SIGN-IN SLIP THAT NOTED THE ""SKIN CHANGING COLOR"". RN1 ACKNOWLEDGED THE SURGE IN THE ED (A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PRESENTING DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD) MAY HAVE IMPACTED HIS ABILITY TO PERFORM TIMELY RE-ASSESSMENTS. WHEN RN1 WAS ASKED IF HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PEDIATRIC FEVER ASSESSMENT CRITERIA LOCATED ON A FLIP CARD INDEX FOR TRIAGE NURSES, HE STATED ""I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE"". WHEN ASKED WHY HE DID NOT CHECK FOR CAPILLARY REFILL DUE TO PATIENT 1'S FEVER, HE STATED CAPILLARY REFILL WAS ""DONE AT THE BEDSIDE"". FURTHER IN THE INTERVIEW, RN1 STATED AGAIN ""CAPILLARY REFILL IS A BEDSIDE PROCEDURE, NOT DONE IN TRIAGE"". RN1 STATED THERE WAS ""NO BOX"" ON THE COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL RECORD TO RECORD A CAPILLARY REFILL. 

IN FURTHER REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL RECORD, THERE WAS INCONSISTENT DOCUMENTATION OF PATIENT 1'S VITAL SIGNS AND RE-ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO THE CHIEF COMPLAINT AND SYMPTOMS FROM 1:56 P.M. UNTIL  PATIENT 1 WAS TRANSFERRED AT 10:34 P.M. (THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD TO REFLECT THE TIME PATIENT 1 WAS PLACED IN AN ED BED)

1.	TEMPERATURES WERE DOCUMENTED AT 1:46 P.M., (102.2F),  3:35 P.M. (102.5F (90 MINUTES AFTER TYLENOL), 5:29 P.M. (100.4F) AND 9 P.M. (99.1F)  
     THE POLICY FOR RE-ASSESSMENTS WAS 30 MINUTES FOR EMERGENT OR ABNORMAL OR 60 MINUTES FOR URGENT.
2.	HEART RATES WERE DOCUMENTED AT 1:46 P.M. (160), 5:29 P.M. (122), 6:30 P.M. (140), AND 9 P.M. (113).  
     THE POLICY FOR RE-ASSESSMENTS WAS 30 MINUTES FOR EMERGENT OR ABNORMAL OR 60 MINUTES FOR URGENT.
3.	RESPIRATIONS WERE DOCUMENTED AT 1:46 P.M. (32), 5:29 P.M. (28), 6:30 P.M. (24) AND 9 P.M. (24).  
     THE POLICY FOR RE-ASSESSMENTS WAS 30 MINUTES FOR EMERGENT OR ABNORMAL OR 60 MINUTES FOR URGENT.
4.	BLOOD PRESSURE - NONE NOTED THROUGHOUT STAY   
5.	CAPILLARY REFILL DONE ONLY PRIOR TO TRANSFER  
6.	CENTRAL PULSES - NONE NOTED THROUGHOUT STAY 
7.   THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION OF ANY INTAKE OR OUTPUT (TO RULE OUT DEHYDRATION)
8.   THERE WAS NO RE-ASSESSEMENT OF PAIN FOLLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION OF TWO DOSES OF MORPHINE.

IN REVIEW OF AN AREA DESIGNATED FOR ED PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT, RN2 NOTED RESPIRATORY EFFORTS AS REGULAR AND UNLABORED AT 5:38 P.M. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PRIOR OR FURTHER NURSING PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS BY RN2. 

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH RN2 ON 1/20/10 AT 9:10 A.M., HE STATED HE RECALLED PATIENT 1 AS IT WAS AN ""EXTREMELY BUSY DAY"" WITH ""PARADES OF AMBULANCES"" AND ""LOTS IN THE WAITING ROOM"". RN2 STATED HE NEVER RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION FROM TRIAGE DURING PATIENT 1'S WAIT IN THE ED AND HE DID NOT RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE TN WHEN PATIENT 1 WAS PLACED IN A BED IN THE ED. RN2 FURTHER STATED ""I AM UNAWARE OF PATIENTS UNTIL THEY LAND IN MY ROOM"". RN2 STATED HE DOES NOT KNOW THE ASSIGNED TRIAGE LEVEL OF PATIENTS UNTIL ""I LOOK IT UP"" AND ""DO MY OWN ASSESSMENT"". RN2 STATED PATIENT 1 WAS ""NOT AS ANIMATED AS A TWO YEAR OLD SHOULD BE"" AND WAS JUST ""LAYING STILL WHICH IS NOT NORMAL FOR A TWO YEAR OLD"". RN2 STATED HE WAS ""STRUCK BY HER NON-RESISTANCE"". RN 2 STATED PATIENT 1 ""CONTINUED TO MOAN WHEN SHE NODDED ON AND OFF"". RN2 STATED PATIENT 1 WAS FULLY DRESSED AND HE ""OPENED AND PEEKED"" BENEATH HER CLOTHING. RN2 STATED PATIENT 1'S ""WHOLE BODY WAS PURPURA"" WHICH HE FURTHER DESCRIBED AS ""APPEARED BRUISED UNIFORMLY"". RN2 STATED THE BRUISING ON PATIENT 1'S FACE LOOKED LIKE ROSACEA (A SKIN CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY REDNESS OR PIMPLES) BUT THE COLOR WAS PURPLE. RN2 STATED HE WAS NOT GIVEN AND DID NOT SEE A REFERRAL FORM FROM THE PHYSICIAN AT THE UCC. RN2 STATED HE INFORMED PA2 ""IN PASSING"" THAT HE HAD ""A VERY SICK CHILD"" BUT DID NOT RECALL HOW MUCH TIME PASSED BEFORE PA2 INITIALLY SAW THE CHILD AT THE BEDSIDE. RN2 STATED HE WAS ""CONSTANTLY"" RE-ASSESSING PATIENT 1 BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITH HIS ADDITIONAL WORK LOAD HE DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO DOCUMENT HIS ASSESSMENTS OR RE-ASSESSMENTS. 

IN REVIEW OF A POLICY TITLED EMERGENCY ROOM    TRIAGE, NO DATE, THE FIVE CLASSIFICATIONS TO DETERMINE THE PRIORITY OF CARE WERE DEFINED:

LEVEL 1: RESUSCITATION  CONDITIONS THAT ARE THREATS TO LIFE OR LIMB REQUIRING IMMEDIATE AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTIONS. **THE ED MD IS IMMEDIATELY INFORMED OF ALL PATIENTS**

LEVEL 2: EMERGENT  CONDITIONS THAT ARE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE, LIMB OR FUNCTION. REQUIRES RAPID MEDICAL INTERVENTION OR DELEGATED ACTS. **THE ED MD IS IMMEDIATELY 
INFORMED OF ALL EMERGENCY PATIENTS**

LEVEL 3: URGENT  CONDITION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PROGRESS TO A SERIOUS PROBLEM REQUIRING EMERGENCY INTERVENTION. 

LEVEL 4: DELAYED CONDITIONS THAT WHEN RELATED TO PATIENT AGE, DISTRESS OR POTENTIAL FOR DETERIORATION AND/OR COMPLICATIONS WOULD BENEFIT FROM INTERVENTION OR REASSURANCE.
	 
LEVEL 5: MINOR  CONDITIONS THAT MAY BE ACUTE BUT NON-URGENT AS WELL AS CHRONIC PROBLEMS WITH OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION.

THIS POLICY DID NOT STIPULATE TIME FRAMES FOR THE PATIENT TO BE SEEN BY THE PHYSICIAN OR PA AT EACH OF THE FIVE LEVELS OF CARE. 

IN REVIEW OF THE TRIAGE REASSESSMENT GUIDELINES, AN ADDENDUM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM    TRIAGE POLICY, THERE WAS STIPULATION THE REASSESSMENT TIMES WERE DETERMINED BY THE LEVEL ASSIGNED AND WOULD INCLUDE A RE-ASSESSMENT OF THE CHIEF COMPLAINT, ANY CHANGE IN CONDITION, A RE-ASSESSMENT OF ANY ABNORMAL VITAL SIGNS AND RESPONSE TO MEDICATION OR TREATMENT. THE POLICY FURTHER STATED ""ALL RE-ASSESSMENTS ARE TO BE DOCUMENTED ON THE ED RECORD"" AND ""ALL ABNORMAL VITAL SIGNS WILL BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROVIDER AND WILL BE REPEATED WITHIN 30 MINUTES"".

1.  LEVEL 1 	RESUSCITATION    EVERY 5 MINUTES*
2.  LEVEL 2 	EMERGENT  	EVERY 15 MINUTES*
3.  LEVEL 3 	URGENT  	EVERY 60 MINUTES
4.  LEVEL 4 	DELAYED  	EVERY 90 MINUTES
5.  LEVEL 5 	MINOR 	 	EVERY 120 MINUTES

* RESUSCITATION AND EMERGENCY PATIENTS WILL BE PLACED INTO A TREATMENT AREA AND THE REASSESSMENTS WILL BE COMPLETED AT THE BEDSIDE BY THE PRIMARY RN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY ASSESSMENT AND REASSESSMENT.

IN REVIEW OF AN UNDATED FACILITY POLICY TITLED PATIENT ASSESSMENT/REASSESSMENT AND CARE PLANNING, NO DATE, THE RE-ASSESSMENT OF ED PATIENTS WAS DEFINED AS:
"" REASSESSMENT IS DETERMINED BY TRIAGE CLASSIFICATION, RELATED TO CHIEF COMPLAINT AND SYMPTOMS. AT THE TIME OF RE-ASSESSMENT, ALL ABNORMAL VITAL SIGNS WILL BE REPORTED TO THE ED PROVIDER AND REPEATED WITHIN 30 MINUTES."" THE MINIMUM TIME FRAME REQUIREMENTS FOR REASSESSMENT WERE THE SAME AS DEFINED IN THE TRIAGE REASSESSMENT GUIDELINES.

IN REVIEW OF AN INDEX CARD TITLED PEDIATRIC FEVER, DATED 12-05, AN ASSESSMENT TOOL USED BY THE TN TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF CARE TO BE ASSIGNED, THERE WAS STIPULATION TO EVALUATE CAPILLARY REFILL, CENTRAL PULSES, PRESENCE OF HEADACHE AND PURPURA TO DETERMINE IF THE LEVEL OF CARE WAS EMERGENT.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE RN1 HAD ASSESSED OR RE-ASSESSED PATIENT 1 APPROPRIATELY TO DETERMINE AN EMERGENT VERSUS AN URGENT CONDITION WAS PRESENT.

IN REVIEW OF A STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE TITLED PEDIATRIC FEVER MANAGEMENT IN TRIAGE, REVISED 07/09, THERE WAS CRITERIA TO PROMPT THE TRIAGE NURSE TO NOTIFY THE ED PROVIDER TO SEE THE PATIENT IMMEDIATELY FOR MANY FACTORS INCLUDING:
1.	FEVER >38.3 WITH HISTORY OF HIGH RISK FACTORS
4.   RASH WITH PURPLE OR RED SPOTS OR DOTS
5.   INCONSOLABLE CRYING
8.	ABNORMAL OR UNEXPLAINED BRUISING
10.   BEHAVIOR CHANGES
11.  SOMNOLENCE OR CONFUSION
12.  DIFFICULT TO AROUSE OR UNRESPONSIVE
13.  LIMP, WEAK OR NOT MOVING
14.  DEHYDRATION

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT (PA1) ON 1/20/11 AT 4:10 P.M., HE STATED HE WAS THE FIRST PROVIDER TO SEE PATIENT 1. PA1 STATED ""I WAS ASKED TO GO INTO THE TRIAGE AREA AND ASSESS THINGS ""DUE TO A SURGE"". PA1 STATED HE WAS ASSIGNED TO BE THE PIT (PROVIDER IN TRIAGE) ON 11/29/10 AT APPROXIMATELY 1 P.M. AND HE WAS ASSISTING THE TN WITH THE RE-ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS IN THE WAITING AREAS. DURING THE INTERVIEW, PA1 IDENTIFIED AN UNTITLED, UNDATED FORM WITH A TIME NOTED AS 3:35 P.M., AS HIS PIT NOTES. PA1 DEFINED THE FORM AS HIS ""PIT NOTES"" (PROVIDER IN TRIAGE) AND ACKNOWLEDGED ""THERE WERE NO NOTES FROM ME"" ON THIS FORM FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT 1 (THE SECTIONS NOTED FOR HISTORY AND PHYSICAL, IMPESSION AND CONDITION WERE LEFT BLANK). IN A REVIEW OF THIS FORM THERE WERE ORDERS DOCUMENTED FOR ""ZOFRAN, P.O.[ORAL] FLUIDS"". PA1 RECALLED ORDERING THE ZOFRAN AS PATIENT 1'S FAMILY HAD SAID SHE HAD BEEN VOMITING PRIOR TO THE ED VISIT. PA1 STATED ""IF SHE STILL VOMITS IT WOULD INDICATE HOW SICK SHE IS"". PA1 STATED PATIENT 1 WAS ""RUDDY CHEEKED"" BUT ""NOT OUTSIDE NORMAL"". PA1 STATED HE DID NOT UNDRESS THE CHILD TO EXAMINE PATIENT 1'S BODY FURTHER AND DID NOT PERFORM A PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT. PA1 DESCRIBED PATIENT 1 AS AN ""UNREMARKABLE, ILL CHILD"". PA1 DID NOT RECALL SEEING THE REFERRAL LETTER FROM THE UCC PHYSICIAN. 

IN REVIEW OF AN UNTITLED FORM ACKNOWLEDGED BY PA2 AS THE MSE, DATED 11/29/10 AT 4:48 P.M. AND CO-SIGNED BY PA2 AND THE ED PHYSICIAN (MD1), PA2 NOTED PATIENT 1 HAD BRUISING ON HER CHEEKS, EAR LOBES AND OVER HER BODY WHICH THE PARENTS STATED HAD STARTED THE PRIOR EVENING. PA2 DOCUMENTED PATIENT 1 HAD COMPLAINED OF A SORE THROAT AND EARACHE AND HAD A FEVER FOR TWO DAYS. PA2 DOCUMENTED SHE HAD CONSULTED WITH THE PHYSICIAN REGARDING PATIENT 1 BUT THE DATE AND TIME SPACE ON THE FORM WAS LEFT BLANK. 

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PA2 ON 1/20/11 AT 10 A.M., SHE STATED SHE WAS WALKING PAST THE ""HALL CHAIRS"" ABOUT FOUR HOURS AFTER PATIENT 1'S ARRIVAL TO THE ED AND WAS CONFRONTED BY PATIENT 1'S FATHER WHO STATED HE ""HAD BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME"". PA2 STATED THE FATHER TOLD HER HIS CHILD WAS SICK AND INQUIRED HOW LONG IT MIGHT BE BEFORE SHE WOULD BE SEEN. PA2 STATED ""I KNEW SHE NEEDED A ROOM"" AND STARTED CARING FOR PATIENT 1 IMMEDIATELY. PA2 STATED PATIENT 1 WAS WARM AND CRYING. PA2 STATED SHE NOTED ""BRUISING"" ON PATIENT 1'S CHEEKS, EARS AND LEGS AND REVEALED ""IT WAS EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TO CONCERN ME"". PA2 STATED THE ""BRUISING"" WAS ""NOT A RASH"" AND IT WAS ""NON-BLANCHABLE"". PA2 DESCRIBED THE BRUISING FURTHER AS PATCHES AND CALLED IT ""PURPURAL"".  PA2 STATED THE BRUISING WAS ""MORE INTENSE"" ON THE EXTREMITIES. SHE FURTHER STATED FROM ""FAR AWAY"" SHE MIGHT LOOK ""FLUSHED"", BUT ""NOT IF EXAMINED CLOSELY"" AND...""IT DIDN'T BLANCH"". PA2 STATED PATIENT 1 WAS ""ROOMED"" (TAKEN TO AN ED BED) ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER AND SHE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ONE OF THE ED PHYSICIANS (MD1) TO SEE THE PATIENT. PA2 STATED MD1 ASSUMED THE CARE OF PATIENT 1 ""WHEN THE LABS CAME BACK"".  PA2 STATED SHE NEVER RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION FROM THE TN OR PA1 REGARDING PATIENT 1. PA2 STATED THE FAMILY ""DID NOT GIVE ME A LETTER FROM URGENT CARE, BUT COMMUNICATED CLEARLY THEY WERE HERE TO RULE OUT MENINGITIS"".  

IN REVIEW OF A DICTATED REPORT DATED 11/29/10 AT 9:34 P.M., MD1 DOCUMENTED PATIENT 1 TO HAVE SLIGHT JAUNDICE (YELLOW COLORING) OF THE SKIN WITH BRUISING ON THE CHEEKS, EARLOBES, THORAX, BUTTOCKS AND LOWER EXTREMITIES. MD1 DOCUMENTED THE RESULTS OF BLOOD TESTS DONE, INCLUDING ABNORMAL LIVER TESTS, AND RECOMMENDED PATIENT 1 BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FACILITY FOR ""FURTHER INTENSIVE CARE"".

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH MD1 ON 1/21/11 AT 1 P.M., HE STATED PA2 ""PROBABLY SAW THE CHILD AROUND 5:30 OR SO"" AND ""GOT ME INVOLVED ABOUT 6 P.M"". MD1 STATED HE OBSERVED ""BRUISING"" AND CALLED IT ""DISTURBING PURPURA"". MD1 REVEALED HE HAD NEVER BEEN INFORMED OF OR GIVEN A LETTER OF REFERRAL FROM THE UCC PHYSICIAN. MD1 STATED HE ASSESSED PATIENT 1, REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY TESTS AND MADE DIRECT CONTACT WITH A PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE SPECIALIST TO PREPARE FOR TRANSFER. MD1 STATED ""I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD THE KID IN FRONT OF ME HOURS EARLIER"". 

IN REVIEW OF A POLICY TITLED ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY, EMTALA, REVISED 4/2008, THE ROLE OF THE PHYSICIAN IN PERFORMING THE MSE WAS DEFINED. THE POLICY, HOWEVER, DID NOT STIPULATE THE ANTICIPATED TIME FOR THE PATIENT TO BE SEEN BY THE PHYSICIAN OR PA FOR THE DIFFERENT TRIAGE LEVELS ASSIGNED (1 THROUGH 5). 

IN A FURTHER REVIEW OF THIS POLICY THERE WAS DEFINITION OF THE TRIAGE ASSESSMENT. THE POLICY STIPULATED AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT WOULD BE PERFORMED WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF THE ARRIVAL OF EVERY PATIENT AND A COMPLETE TRIAGE ASSESSMENT WOULD BE CONDUCTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE POLICY NOTED THE COMPLETE ASSESSMENT WOULD DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF THE CHIEF COMPLAINT, THE PHYSICAL FINDINGS, VITAL SIGNS AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY. THE POLICY STIPULATED, WHEN APPLICABLE, THE STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE FOR PEDIATRIC FEVER WOULD BE INITIATED. THE POLICY STIPULATED COMPLETE REASSESSMENTS OF WAITING PATIENTS WOULD BE BASED ON THE CHIEF COMPLAINT AND TRIAGE CLASSIFICATION. THE POLICY REFERRED TO THE REASSESSMENT GUIDELINES FOR FURTHER REFERENCE.

IN AN INITIAL TOUR OF THE ED WITH THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (DES) ON 1/18/11 AT 
10:40 A.M., THE WAITING ROOM, REGISTRATION, TRIAGE AND PATIENT CARE AREAS WERE OBSERVED. THE DES STATED THERE WERE 23 BEDS IN THE ED AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS SEEN WAS 4500 PER MONTH. THE DES STATED ON 11/29/10 THERE WAS ONE TN ASSIGNED AND THE TRIAGE ROOM AND REGISTRATION CLERK WERE LOCATED NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN ONE CENTRAL AREA. THE DES STATED A ""STAT"" (IMMEDIATE) REGISTRATION WAS DONE AT THE TIME THE PATIENT ARRIVED WITH THE NAME, DATE OF BIRTH AND CHIEF COMPLAINT OBTAINED IN ORDER TO BEGIN THE MEDICAL RECORD. THE DES STATED PRIOR TO 12/15/10, THE ED SIGN-IN SLIP COMPLETED BY THE PATIENT OR DESIGNEE WOULD BE PASSED ON TO THE TRIAGE NURSE WITH THE PATIENT'S ""STICKERS"" (LABELS TO BE PLACED ON THE RECORD FOR PATIENT IDENTIFICATION). THE DES STATED ALL NURSES WORKING IN THE ED (EXCEPT ORIENTEES OR PRECEPTORS) WERE ASSIGNED TO TRIAGE. SHE STATED NURSES HIRED WITHOUT TRIAGE EXPERIENCE TOOK A CLASS DURING ORIENTATION AND EXPERIENCED NURSES WERE ORIENTED IN THE TRIAGE AREA. THE DES STATED THERE WAS NO COMPETENCY OR ANNUAL COMPETENCY REVIEW OR ANY ONGOING TRAINING FOR TRIAGE NURSES AS THEY WERE ONLY ASSIGNING THE ACUITY OF THE PATIENT, NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE MSE. THE DES ALSO STATED THERE WAS NO ONGOING TRAINING FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PALS (PEDIATRIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT) CERTIFICATION. THERE WERE NO ED POLICIES OR GUIDELINES FOR THE STIPULATION OF TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRIAGE NURSES.    

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DES ON 1/20/11 AT 3:10 P.M., SHE DEMONSTRATED THE COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL RECORD FOR THE ED WHICH INCLUDED A PROMPT TO BE USED FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THE DES ACKNOWLEDGED RN1 HAD NOT ACTIVATED THE PROMPT AND THEREFORE HAD NOT SEEN THE SCREEN FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF A PEDIATRIC PATIENT. THE DES ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED RN1 HAD NOT ACCESSED THE APPROPRIATE SCREEN FOR ASSESSING PAIN FOR A CHILD. THE DES STATED AT THE TIME OF PATIENT 1'S VISIT THERE WAS NO BOX FOR RECORDING THE CAPILLARY REFILL BUT STATED THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN A NARRATIVE. THE DES ALSO REVEALED THERE WAS NO ED SURGE PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN ED WAS AT MAXIMUM CENSUS AND WAIT TIMES WERE LONG.

2.  DURING AN INITIAL TOUR ON 1/18/11, THE DIRECTOR OF WOMENS' AND CHILDRENS' SERVICES (DWCS) STATED THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 100 BIRTHS A MONTH IN THE FAMILY BIRTH CENTER (FBC). THE DWCS STATED PATIENTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO COME DIRECTLY TO THE FBC UNLESS THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS LOCKED IN WHICH CASE THEY WOULD ENTER THE FACILITY THROUGH THE ED. ED STAFF WOULD THEN SEND THEM DIRECTLY TO THE FBC WHERE THEY WERE TO BE IMMEDIATELY ASSESSED BY A LABOR AND DELIVERY RN IN THE FBC TRIAGE ROOM. THE DWCS STATED THE MEDICAL STAFF HAD DELEGATED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ASSESSING THE COMPETENCY OF THE LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSE TO THE LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSE MANAGER.  THE STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE WAS REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PRACTICE COMMITTEE, OB COMMITTEE AND THE MEDICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

IN REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL STAFF RULES & REGULATIONS, EMERGENCY CARE AND SERVICES - QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL, APPROVED 7/30/09, THERE WAS STIPULATION ALL PATIENTS WHO PRESENT TO THE HOSPITAL INCLUDING... THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND THE LABOR AND DELIVERY UNIT, AND WHO REQUEST AN EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT FOR...ACTIVE LABOR, SHALL BE EVALUATED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF...ACTIVE LABOR. THIS SCREENING EXAM MAY BE PERFORMED BY THE FOLLOWING PERSONS:

""2. IN THE LABOR AND DELIVERY UNIT: BY EITHER A PHYSICIAN OR BY A REGISTERED NURSE (RN) WHO HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY THE L&D NURSE MANAGER TO BE QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED IN OBSTETRICAL NURSING AND WHO IS REQUIRED TO FOLLOW STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES APPROVED BY THE MEDICAL STAFF.""

IN REVIEW OF AN FBC POLICY TITLED MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM (OB) STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE, REVISED 10/08, THERE WAS STIPULATION FOR THE INITIAL COMPETENCY VALIDATION AND AN ONGOING COMPETENCY VALIDATION. BOTH VALIDATIONS REQUIRED AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF SKILLS WITH COMPLETION OF A WRITTEN POST TEST. THE POLICY FURTHER STIPULATED: A LIST OF RN'S AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM THIS STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE WILL BE MAINTAINED IN NURSING ADMINISTRATION.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH RN3 ON 1/18/11 AT 11 A.M., SHE STATED THAT ALL OF THE LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSES HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO TRIAGE OBSTETRICAL PATIENTS AND THERE WAS AN ANNUAL EXAM FOR COMPETENCY. RN3 PROVIDED A COPY OF THE OB TRIAGE RECORD AND STATED THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDED A NON-STRESS TEST (MONITORING THE STATUS OF THE FETUS AND THE CONTRACTIONS OF THE UTERUS) AND A CERVICAL EXAM WHEN INDICATED.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DWCS ON 1/18/11 AT 11:30 A.M., THE DWCS WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE ANNUAL COMPETENCY TRAINING OR TEST RESULTS FOR THE LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSES (RN4, RN5, RN6) WHO TRIAGED THE THREE OBSTETRICAL PATIENTS REVIEWED (PATIENTS 6, 7, 8). THE DWCS STATED THE RECORD KEEPING HAD BEEN DISORGANIZED AND SOME OF THE NURSES HAD NOT TURNED IN THEIR PAPERWORK.

IN AN INTERVIEW ON 1/21/11 AT 11 A.M., THE DWCS WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT FIVE OF FIVE NURSES (RN7, RN8, RN9, RN10, RN11) WORKING IN LABOR AND DELIVERY THAT SHIFT HAD COMPLETED THE ANNUAL COMPETENCY EVALUATION FOR THE MSE IN 2010. THE DWCS STATED THE FORMER MANAGER HAD NOT MAINTAINED THE RECORDS WHERE THEY WERE READILY RETRIEVABLE AND SHE COULD NOT LOCATE ANY OF THE FILES FOR THE ANNUAL COMPETENCY FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSES. THE DWCS WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE COMPETENCIES FOR THE FIVE NURSES WHICH HAD BEEN DONE IN JANUARY OF 2011 BUT THE DATES WERE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW OF REVIEW FOR THE SURVEY (JULY THROUGH DECEMBER)

Based on interview and record review, the facility (Facility A) failed to comply with CFR 489.24 by failing:

1. To ensure an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) occurred, and was documented, for three of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patients 1, 4, and 14). This resulted in Patient 1 leaving the facility and being transferred to Facility B without a MSE, Patient 4 leaving the Labor & Delivery (L&D) Unit without a MSE, and Patient 14 being seen in L&D without documented evidence a MSE was done by a provider (Refer to A2406);

2. To ensure stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of the facility was provided prior to two of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patients 1 and 4) being directed to go to either Facility B or Facility C. This resulted in the facility not knowing if Patients 1 and 4 were in a stable condition in order to be discharged    or transferred to other acute care facilities (Refer to A2407); and 

3. To ensure the transfer of one of 17 sampled obstetrical patients (Patient 1) occurred in a safe manner when Patient 1 was not provided a medical screening examination, was not determined to be in a stable condition prior to being transferred to Facility B, and was transferred via private vehicle by a family member to Facility B (25.2 miles away from Facility A). This had the potential to result in harm or death to Patient 1 and her infant (Refer to A2409).

Based on interview and record/document review, Hospital A failed to maintain documented evidence of an appropriate inter-facility transfer for 6 of 21 sampled patients (1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 12).  Documentation of Patient 1's re-assessment after a change of condition, a transfer summary report and evidence of informed consent for the transfer were not available in the patient's medical record. In addition, Patient 2, Patient 5 and Patient 11's transfer summaries and informed consent for transfer were not available in the patients' medical records. In addition, Patient 8 and Patient 12's transfer summaries were not available in the patients' medical record. The omission of the patients' transfer summaries and informed consents, failed to ensure evidence of the required physician attestation of patient stability, informed consent and appropriateness for the inter-facility transfers.  

Findings:  

1. Patient 1 was admitted     to Hospital A's Emergency Department (ED) via paramedics on 12/24/15 at 7:34 A.M. per the Assessment History Report. Patient 1's family members stated the the patient was observed with new onset difficulty speaking and weakness. A ""Code Stroke"" protocol (a specific set of laboratory, radiology and neurological screening examinations used in the diagnosis and treatment a suspected stroke, which is an emergent brain disorder which can cause permanent disability and/or death) was initiated upon the patient's arrival in the ED.

During an interview and joint record review, on 2/2/16 at 11:30 A.M., Medical Doctor (MD) 2 recalled Patient 1 and  reviewed Patient 1's ED progress notes, dated 12/24/15. MD 2 stated that he examined the patient upon the patient's arrival in the ED. MD 2 stated Patient 1 was aphasic (unable to speak) and demonstrated decreased right sided grip strength. MD 2 stated that a head CT (computerized tomography; a specialized radiology examination used in the diagnosis of brain disorders) was completed and reviewed by the neurologist (physician specialist in nerve and brain disorders). MD 2 stated that Patient 1's aphasia and grip improved after the CT and during the on call neurologist examination. MD 2 stated that he consulted with a physician at the patient's HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) primary care hospital (Hospital B), ""felt the patient was stable"" and proceeded with transfer arrangements (prior to 10:00 A.M.).  MD 2 recalled registered nurse (RN) 1 reported an increased facial droop and change in condition ""around 10 am"". MD 2 stated he re-examined the patient and spoke to the patient/family members, but acknowledged that he did not document the patient re-examination or the discussion with the patient/family members regarding the risks/benefits of the planned transfer. In addition, MD 2 stated that he had not communicated or re-consulted,with the on call neurologist, after the reported re-occurrence of the patient's symptoms.

During an interview and joint record review of nurse notes, on 2/3/16 at 7:45 A.M., RN 1 recalled Patient 1 and reviewed nurse notes, dated 12/24/15.  RN 1 stated that Patient 1 was admitted     as a ""Code Stroke"" and that he was assigned to the patient throughout the patient's ED visit. RN 1 stated that the patient's initial aphasia and right sided weakness improved after the patient returned from the initial CT exam, at approximately 8:17 A.M.  RN 1 stated he then conducted a nursing assessment, assisted with the on call neurologist consultation and monitored the patient's status. RN 1 stated Patient 1's family members stated the patient was ""nearly back to normal around 9:30"".  RN 1 stated at 10:03 A.M., he informed MD 2 of  the patient's ""reappearing symptoms, right side weakness, and return of facial droop.""  RN 1 stated he conducted a nursing re-assessment, but acknowledged that he did not document the re-assessment in the patient's medical record.  RN 1 acknowledged that the next nursing note documentation occurred at 11:32 A.M. The nursing documentation indicated that the patient was transferred at ""1215 (12:15 P.M.)"" to the patient's primary care hospital.  RN 1 acknowledged that the nursing notes did not include further nursing assessments or vital sign documentation after the change in the patient's condition at 10:03 A.M.  

During an interview on 2/3/16 at 8:00 A.M., the Emergency Department Director (EDD) stated a handwritten ED Transfer Form should be completed on each patient transferred from the hospital ED to other facilities. The EDD stated the ED Transfer Form provided information regarding the patient condition at the time of discharge/transfer and included both nursing and physician summaries. The EDD stated Patient 1's ED Transfer Form was not available for review as it could not be located in Patient 1's medical record. 

During a record review on 2/22/16 at 2:00 P.M., Patient 1's medical record at Hospital B was reviewed.  Patient 1 was admitted on [DATE] at 12:23 P.M. after arriving by Critical Care Transport (CCT).  A ""Stroke Code"" was also initiated on Patient 1 at Hospital B. The nursing assessment dated    /timed 12/24/16 at 12:37 P.M., included the presence of right sided weakness, aphasia and right sided facial drooping. A review of Hospital B's neurology consultation note, dated 12/24/15 at 1:13 P.M., included ""[Patient 1] presented with right sided weakness, facial droop and slurred speech...resolved at 0930 (9:30 A.M.)...started again at about 1030 (10:30 A.M.)...Symptoms worsened in the ambulance.""  In addition, Patient 1's ED Transfer Form, initiated at Hospital A, was found at Hospital B and reviewed. The Physician Summary area on the ED Transfer Form had not been completed in a thorough manner and omitted information such as a diagnosis and physician orders for transport. The Physician Summary included a checklist for ""Reason for Transfer (include risk and benefit)"" and ""Insurance Request"" checkbox had been marked with an ""x"".  An area on the form for the physician's signature attestation for the transfer had been left blank. In addition, the Nursing Summary area on the ED Transfer Form had not been completed with regard to patient/representative transfer acknowledgements, hand off report to the receiving facility and the time of recorded vital signs. Furthermore, an attached Transfer Consent form, which indicated a patient/representative acknowledgment of explanation and acceptance of the transfer, had been left blank and unsigned.     

An interview with MD 3 was conducted on 2/24/16 at 8:30 A.M. MD 3 stated he was the Tele-neurologist on call and consulted by MD 2 (the Emergency Department physician) when Patient 1 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) , on 12/24/15, with symptoms of a stroke.  MD 3 stated that since Patient 1 had unknown onset of her stroke symptoms greater than 4 hours and that Patient 1's head CT (computed tomogram - a scan of the brain) was negative for bleeding or blockage of large vessels, that Patient 1 would not be a candidate for TPA (tissue plasminogen activator- a medicine that breaks down blood clots).  MD 3 stated his management plan was that Patient 1 was stable for transfer to a hospital that was part of Patient 1's HMO insurance plan for further management.  MD 3 stated that during his evaluation of Patient 1 that he observed her to ""wax and wane"" or slightly improve and worsen in her stroke symptoms; however MD 3 stated that Patient 1 did not have worsening symptoms than when Patient 1 presented to the ED. MD 3 stated that he did not have an expectation that the hospital would contact him if Patient 1 had slightly worsening symptoms as this was normally seen in this type of stroke patient. However, MD 3 stated  that determination would be dictated  by the hospital polices.  MD 3 acknowledged that MD 2 should have documented an examination of Patient 1 after the reported change of condition and prior to transfer and that MD2 should have signed the physician attestation that Patient 1 was stable for transfer.
A second interview with MD 2 was conducted on 2/24/16 at 9:20 A.M.  MD 2 stated he was the Emergency Department (ED) physician who provided care for Patient 1.  MD 2 stated Patient 1 presented with signs and symptoms of a stroke and that the onset of these symptoms was unknown, but greater than the 4 hour window to treat with TPA. MD 2 stated that he consulted MD 3 who was the tele-neurologist on call and that MD 3 advised him to obtain an emergent CTA (computerized tomography angiogram- a scan of the brain and blood vessels) which was negative for any blockage of large blood vessels. MD 2 stated that MD 3 advised him that Patient 1 would be stable for transfer to a hospital that is part of her HMO health insurance plan for further management. MD 2 stated that prior to transfer of Patient 1 that he was notified by RN 1 that Patient 1 was developing facial droop and right sided weakness and that MD 2 examined Patient 1 but he did not document his physical assessment of Patient 1. MD 2 stated he did not consult MD 3 about Patient 1's worsening of stroke symptoms because Patient 1's symptoms were not worse than her ""baseline"" or level of presenting symptoms. MD 2 stated that Patient 1 was still not a candidate for the TPA treatment and the minor worsening of symptoms would not change the plan for transfer. MD 2 stated he discussed the transfer with Patient 1's family and that the family was in agreement, however, MD 2 stated that he did not document his conversation with the family. MD 2 acknowledged that he should have documented his physical examination of Patient 1 after the change in her condition prior to transfer. MD 2 also acknowledged that he should have documented his conversation with Patient 1's family regarding the transfer. MD 2 stated he did not recall whether he signed the physician attestation that Patient 1 was stable for transfer.

Based on review of the facility's policies/procedures, facility document review, staff interview, and medical record review the facility failed to maintain a complete central log on each individual who came to the emergency department, as defined in ?489.24(b), seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment, was refused treatment, or whether he or she was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   . Specifically, the facility failed to record Sample Patient #1 into the emergency department's log and failed to ensure that the logs for the emergency department and obstetrics department were complete.

The findings were:

A review of the facility's policy titled, ""EMTALA Guidelines for Emergency Department Services"" last revised 3/2008 stated the following, in pertinent parts:
""...Medical Screening Exams:
Medical Screening Exams should include at a minimum the following:
?Emergency Department Log entry including disposition of patient
?Patient's triage record
?Vital signs
?History
?Physical exam of affected systems and potentially affected systems
?Exam of known chronic conditions
?Necessary testing to rule out emergency medical conditions
?Notification and use of on-call personnel to complete previously mentioned guidelines
?Notification and use of on-call physicians to diagnose and/or stabilize the patient as necessary
?Vital signs upon discharge or transfer
?Complete documentation of the medical screening exam ..."" 

A review of the facility's Emergency Department and Obstetrical Department's logs that were used to satisfy the requirements at 489.20 revealed that Sample patient #1 was not included in the log. Also the logs for both departments were noted to have incomplete entries which included the absence of dispositions of some of the patients.

A review of the facility's Emergency Department's log revealed that the following entries were incomplete:
Sample patient #8's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #9's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. 
Sample patient #10's entry from 1/29/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #11's entry from 1/30/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time or disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.
Sample patient #12's entry from 1/31/2012 did not have a discharge disposition. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.

Sample patient #15's entry from 2/1/2012 did not have a discharge date   /time. The log also did not include information about the patient's presenting complaint.

An interview with the facility's Director of the Emergency Department on 4/12/2012 at approximately 2:45 PM revealed that the logs provided to the surveyors were the logs that the facility used to satisfy the requirements of this section. S/he confirmed that the log was incomplete and that it did not include Sample patient #1.

An interview with the facility's Director of Obstetrics on 4/12/2012 at approximately 2:00 PM  revealed that there was one log used to capture all patients presenting to the obstetrics department. S/he reviewed the log titled ""OB Log"" and stated that all admissions, transfers, and discharges for the department would be documented on this log. The Director of Obstetrics stated that the logs are typically completed by technicians and are not audited by staff. S/he confirmed that the log had missing information as to discharge of patients from the department.

Based on medical record review, facility document review and staff interview the facility failed to ensure that patients were provided an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE).

This failure has the potential to lead to patient harm due to not receiving the appropriate MSE and possible necessary treatment or therapies.

Findings:

1. The facility failed to ensure that Sample Patient #1 received an appropriate MSE. This patient was seen by an Emergency Department (ED) physician who determined the patient was at risk due to his suicidal ideation and violent behavior. A mental health (M1) hold was placed and evaluation by the psychiatric team ordered but was never completed. The patient was discharged    with law enforcement to jail due to his violent behavior.

a. A review of the medical record for Sample Patient #1 revealed s/he was brought into the ED on 07/05/12 at 3:23 a.m. by ambulance and police in 4 point restraints due to belligerent and assaultive behaviors. The Patient admitted     to drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) report to the receiving RN was that the Patient stated ""you leave me I'll kill myself."" The nursing note indicates the Patient stated to the RN ""My parents are going to kill me.""

Upon arrival to the ER, s/he was temporarily released from restraints after the RN talked to him/her and advised him/her if s/he cooperated they would not be put back on. S/he was administered Ativan 2 mg IV push on three occasions for aggressive behavior. An order was written at 3:32 to notify the psychiatric evaluation team about the Patient. An order for 4 point restraints was also written. During the process of placing the restrains, the Patient kicked an ED tech in the face, was spitting and attempting to bite the RN. The mental health hold (M1) process was initiated at 4:13 a.m. per physician order . The police department was notified at this time regarding Patients assaultive behavior. 

At 4:25 a.m. the nursing notes stated the Patient was sleeping and being prepared to be discharged    to jail. His/her blood alcohol level was 298. The Patient had not received a psychiatric evaluation.

The discharge summary written by the ED physician states the Patient's work up was consistent with alcohol intoxication, possible polypharmacy ingestion or acute exacerbation of mental illness. ""S/he did seem to understand his/her actions and demonstrated medical decision making capacity and I feel s/he is to be held responsible for assaultive behavior toward nursing staff"". The note also stated that the Patient was medically cleared for jail without any obvious evidence of needing further emergency medical management and ""can continue to sober in jail where s/he is safe and unlikely to present further harm to others.""

The Patient was discharged    at 4:59 a.m. in the custody of law enforcement, ambulating and in hand cuffs. ED Physician's discharge instructions stated to place the Patient on suicide watch and obtain psychiatric evaluation in jail.

b. An interview was conducted on 09/25/12 at 1:58 p.m. with the ED Director (EDD), ED Manager, and Director of Quality Management (DQM). The EDD stated that a process has been implemented for psychiatric patients who are abusive and threatening to the ED staff. These patients may be taken off of the M1 hold either before or after they have been evaluated by the psychiatric team and discharged    to jail. They are sent with an order by the ED physician as being a suicide risk and to have a psychiatric evaluation by the psychiatric evaluation team . S/he states this only happens if the patient is medically stable, has failed attempts at de-escalation and is harmful to ED staff. 

c. An interview was conducted on 09/26/12 at 8:25 a.m. with the EDD where s/he wanted to provide some background to the decision of sending violent patients to jail. S/he stated they have been seeing a lot more violent and dangerous patients and there have been several incidents of staff members being attacked by violent patients. Last summer the hospital administration, risk management, and legal counsel met with local law enforcement and a city attorney to discuss what their options were for handling violent patients. The conclusion was to discharge the patients into the custody of the police and they would ensure a psychiatric evaluation would still be obtained. The hospital's contracted psychiatric evaluation team does evaluations at the jail as well, so the physicians could use the jail as another resource to treat these patients. 

d. The ED Medical Director was interviewed on 09/26/12 at 8:50 a.m. S/he stated the patients that are discharged    to jail are medically stabilized and the only thing left to be handled is their psychiatric condition. Evaluations and continued treatment can be handled in jail. The Medical Director stated a policy was revised and approved by medical staff last summer regarding violent patients.

e. An interview was conducted on 09/26/12 at 8:43 a.m. with the Patient's ED physician  where s/he verified documentation in the medical record. S/he stated that because of the Patient's escalating behavior and aggression toward staff s/he decided to discharge the Patient to law enforcement. The Patient denied and showed no signs of physical trauma other than abrasions obtained during the earlier struggle with police. S/he felt that the Patient could get the psychiatric evaluation and care s/he needed in a safer place. 
 
f. The RN for the Patient was interviewed on 09/26/12 at 9:20 a.m. where s/he verified documentation in the medical record. S/he stated the patient came in by ambulance with altered mentation from alcohol and marijuana. S/he was verbally abusive from the time of arrival. His/her behavior continued to escalate and become more violent despite being medicated with Ativan and physically restrained. S/he stated the patient made no suicidal comments but did state that his/her parents were going to kill him/her. When the patient became violent the RN called law enforcement and they arrived on scene very quickly. S/he was discharged    to them on a suicide watch and was to have a psychiatric evaluation in jail.

g. Hospital policy ""Patients on Involuntary Status"", last revision 07/2011 was reviewed.
It states in section VII: staff members may press charges against a patient, who is alleged to have physically harmed patient care personnel and or has caused hospital property damage. The attending physician must ensure that the patient is medically stable for transfer to local law enforcement facilities or to another healthcare entity with appropriate facilities in accordance to these Rules and Regulations and applicable policies. Further, if the patient is on a mental health hold, the physician shall be responsible for relinquishing that patient from the mental health hold in order for local law enforcement to place the patient on a suicide watch.

h. Hospital policy ""EMTALA"" was reviewed. Its defines emergency condition (EMC) as a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy. The policy states the hospital shall provide a medical screening examination (MSE) to determine whether an EMC exists. It defines a MSE as the screening process required to determine with reasonable clinical confidence whether an EMC does or does not exist. The MSE represents a spectrum ranging from a brief history and physical exam to complex processes that also involve performing ancillary studies and procedures. The policy states the MSE is an ongoing process. The medical record must reflect an ongoing assessment of the patient's condition. Monitoring must continue until the individual is stabilized or appropriately admitted     or transferred. There should be evidence of this prior to discharge or transfer. The policy defines a Qualified Medical Person as an individual who is licensed or certified in one of the following professional categories and who has demonstrated current competence in the performance of a MSE: all staff physicians, ED mid-level practitioners, PEPCS team members (psychiatric evaluators) and obstetrical nurses.

2. The facility failed to ensure that Sample Patient #2 received an appropriate MSE. This patient was seen by an ED physician who determined the patient was at risk due to his suicidal ideation and violent behavior. A M1 hold was placed and evaluation by the psychiatric team ordered but was never completed. The patient was discharged    with law enforcement to jail due to his violent behavior.

a. Sample Patient #7 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:12 a.m. S/he was brought into the ED by EMS after an altercation with his/her spouse and then voiced suicidal ideation. The Patient received several doses of Haldol due to aggressive behavior and was also intermittently in 4 point restraints. A M1 hold and psychiatric evaluation was ordered for the Patient by the ED physician. The Patient was in the ED until s/he was discharged    to law enforcement at 4:55 p.m. due to threatening and assaultive behavior. The patient did not receive a psychiatric evaluation before discharge.

b. During an interview with the DQM on 09/26/12 at 12:03 p.m. it was verified that Sample Patient #7 was a patient with suicidal ideation who did not receive a psychiatric evaluation and was discharged    to jail.

FINDINGS:

1. THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE THAT SAMPLE PATIENT #1 RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATE MSE. THIS PATIENT WAS SEEN BY AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) PHYSICIAN WHO DETERMINED THE PATIENT WAS AT RISK DUE TO HIS SUICIDAL IDEATION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. A MENTAL HEALTH (M1) HOLD WAS PLACED AND EVALUATION BY THE PSYCHIATRIC TEAM ORDERED BUT WAS NEVER COMPLETED. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO JAIL DUE TO HIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

A. A REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL RECORD FOR SAMPLE PATIENT #1 REVEALED S/HE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE ED ON 07/05/12 AT 3:23 A.M. BY AMBULANCE AND POLICE IN 4 POINT RESTRAINTS DUE TO BELLIGERENT AND ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIORS. THE PATIENT ADMITTED     TO DRINKING ALCOHOL AND SMOKING MARIJUANA. THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) REPORT TO THE RECEIVING RN WAS THAT THE PATIENT STATED ""YOU LEAVE ME I'LL KILL MYSELF."" THE NURSING NOTE INDICATES THE PATIENT STATED TO THE RN ""MY PARENTS ARE GOING TO KILL ME.""

UPON ARRIVAL TO THE ER, S/HE WAS TEMPORARILY RELEASED FROM RESTRAINTS AFTER THE RN TALKED TO HIM/HER AND ADVISED HIM/HER IF S/HE COOPERATED THEY WOULD NOT BE PUT BACK ON. S/HE WAS ADMINISTERED ATIVAN 2 MG IV PUSH ON THREE OCCASIONS FOR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. AN ORDER WAS WRITTEN AT 3:32 TO NOTIFY THE PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION TEAM ABOUT THE PATIENT. AN ORDER FOR 4 POINT RESTRAINTS WAS ALSO WRITTEN. DURING THE PROCESS OF PLACING THE RESTRAINS, THE PATIENT KICKED AN ED TECH IN THE FACE, WAS SPITTING AND ATTEMPTING TO BITE THE RN. THE MENTAL HEALTH HOLD (M1) PROCESS WAS INITIATED AT 4:13 A.M. PER PHYSICIAN ORDER . THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED AT THIS TIME REGARDING PATIENTS ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR. 

AT 4:25 A.M. THE NURSING NOTES STATED THE PATIENT WAS SLEEPING AND BEING PREPARED TO BE DISCHARGED    TO JAIL. HIS/HER BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS 298. THE PATIENT HAD NOT RECEIVED A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION.

THE DISCHARGE SUMMARY WRITTEN BY THE ED PHYSICIAN STATES THE PATIENT'S WORK UP WAS CONSISTENT WITH ALCOHOL INTOXICATION, POSSIBLE POLYPHARMACY INGESTION OR ACUTE EXACERBATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ""S/HE DID SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HIS/HER ACTIONS AND DEMONSTRATED MEDICAL DECISION MAKING CAPACITY AND I FEEL S/HE IS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARD NURSING STAFF"". THE NOTE ALSO STATED THAT THE PATIENT WAS MEDICALLY CLEARED FOR JAIL WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS EVIDENCE OF NEEDING FURTHER EMERGENCY MEDICAL MANAGEMENT AND ""CAN CONTINUE TO SOBER IN JAIL WHERE S/HE IS SAFE AND UNLIKELY TO PRESENT FURTHER HARM TO OTHERS.""

THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    AT 4:59 A.M. IN THE CUSTODY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, AMBULATING AND IN HAND CUFFS. ED PHYSICIAN'S DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS STATED TO PLACE THE PATIENT ON SUICIDE WATCH AND OBTAIN PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IN JAIL.

B. AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 09/25/12 AT 1:58 P.M. WITH THE ED DIRECTOR (EDD), ED MANAGER, AND DIRECTOR OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT (DQM). THE EDD STATED THAT A PROCESS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS WHO ARE ABUSIVE AND THREATENING TO THE ED STAFF. THESE PATIENTS MAY BE TAKEN OFF OF THE M1 HOLD EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN EVALUATED BY THE PSYCHIATRIC TEAM AND DISCHARGED    TO JAIL. THEY ARE SENT WITH AN ORDER BY THE ED PHYSICIAN AS BEING A SUICIDE RISK AND TO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION BY THE PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION TEAM . S/HE STATES THIS ONLY HAPPENS IF THE PATIENT IS MEDICALLY STABLE, HAS FAILED ATTEMPTS AT DE-ESCALATION AND IS HARMFUL TO ED STAFF. 

C. AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 09/26/12 AT 8:25 A.M. WITH THE EDD WHERE S/HE WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND TO THE DECISION OF SENDING VIOLENT PATIENTS TO JAIL. S/HE STATED THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING A LOT MORE VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS PATIENTS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF STAFF MEMBERS BEING ATTACKED BY VIOLENT PATIENTS. LAST SUMMER THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND LEGAL COUNSEL MET WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A CITY ATTORNEY TO DISCUSS WHAT THEIR OPTIONS WERE FOR HANDLING VIOLENT PATIENTS. THE CONCLUSION WAS TO DISCHARGE THE PATIENTS INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE POLICE AND THEY WOULD ENSURE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION WOULD STILL BE OBTAINED. THE HOSPITAL'S CONTRACTED PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION TEAM DOES EVALUATIONS AT THE JAIL AS WELL, SO THE PHYSICIANS COULD USE THE JAIL AS ANOTHER RESOURCE TO TREAT THESE PATIENTS. 

D. THE ED MEDICAL DIRECTOR WAS INTERVIEWED ON 09/26/12 AT 8:50 A.M. S/HE STATED THE PATIENTS THAT ARE DISCHARGED    TO JAIL ARE MEDICALLY STABILIZED AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE HANDLED IS THEIR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION. EVALUATIONS AND CONTINUED TREATMENT CAN BE HANDLED IN JAIL. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR STATED A POLICY WAS REVISED AND APPROVED BY MEDICAL STAFF LAST SUMMER REGARDING VIOLENT PATIENTS.

E. AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 09/26/12 AT 8:43 A.M. WITH THE PATIENT'S ED PHYSICIAN  WHERE S/HE VERIFIED DOCUMENTATION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. S/HE STATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE PATIENT'S ESCALATING BEHAVIOR AND AGGRESSION TOWARD STAFF S/HE DECIDED TO DISCHARGE THE PATIENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE PATIENT DENIED AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF PHYSICAL TRAUMA OTHER THAN ABRASIONS OBTAINED DURING THE EARLIER STRUGGLE WITH POLICE. S/HE FELT THAT THE PATIENT COULD GET THE PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AND CARE S/HE NEEDED IN A SAFER PLACE. 
 
F. THE RN FOR THE PATIENT WAS INTERVIEWED ON 09/26/12 AT 9:20 A.M. WHERE S/HE VERIFIED DOCUMENTATION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. S/HE STATED THE PATIENT CAME IN BY AMBULANCE WITH ALTERED MENTATION FROM ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA. S/HE WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE FROM THE TIME OF ARRIVAL. HIS/HER BEHAVIOR CONTINUED TO ESCALATE AND BECOME MORE VIOLENT DESPITE BEING MEDICATED WITH ATIVAN AND PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED. S/HE STATED THE PATIENT MADE NO SUICIDAL COMMENTS BUT DID STATE THAT HIS/HER PARENTS WERE GOING TO KILL HIM/HER. WHEN THE PATIENT BECAME VIOLENT THE RN CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY ARRIVED ON SCENE VERY QUICKLY. S/HE WAS DISCHARGED    TO THEM ON A SUICIDE WATCH AND WAS TO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IN JAIL.

G. HOSPITAL POLICY ""PATIENTS ON INVOLUNTARY STATUS"", LAST REVISION 07/2011 WAS REVIEWED.
IT STATES IN SECTION VII: STAFF MEMBERS MAY PRESS CHARGES AGAINST A PATIENT, WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE PHYSICALLY HARMED PATIENT CARE PERSONNEL AND OR HAS CAUSED HOSPITAL PROPERTY DAMAGE. THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN MUST ENSURE THAT THE PATIENT IS MEDICALLY STABLE FOR TRANSFER TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITIES OR TO ANOTHER HEALTHCARE ENTITY WITH APPROPRIATE FACILITIES IN ACCORDANCE TO THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND APPLICABLE POLICIES. FURTHER, IF THE PATIENT IS ON A MENTAL HEALTH HOLD, THE PHYSICIAN SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RELINQUISHING THAT PATIENT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH HOLD IN ORDER FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PLACE THE PATIENT ON A SUICIDE WATCH.

H. HOSPITAL POLICY ""EMTALA"" WAS REVIEWED. ITS DEFINES EMERGENCY CONDITION (EMC) AS A MEDICAL CONDITION MANIFESTING ITSELF BY ACUTE SYMPTOMS OF SUFFICIENT SEVERITY (INCLUDING SEVERE PAIN, PSYCHIATRIC DISTURBANCES AND/OR SYMPTOMS OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE) SUCH THAT THE ABSENCE OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PLACING THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY. THE POLICY STATES THE HOSPITAL SHALL PROVIDE A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION (MSE) TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN EMC EXISTS. IT DEFINES A MSE AS THE SCREENING PROCESS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WITH REASONABLE CLINICAL CONFIDENCE WHETHER AN EMC DOES OR DOES NOT EXIST. THE MSE REPRESENTS A SPECTRUM RANGING FROM A BRIEF HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM TO COMPLEX PROCESSES THAT ALSO INVOLVE PERFORMING ANCILLARY STUDIES AND PROCEDURES. THE POLICY STATES THE MSE IS AN ONGOING PROCESS. THE MEDICAL RECORD MUST REFLECT AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THE PATIENT'S CONDITION. MONITORING MUST CONTINUE UNTIL THE INDIVIDUAL IS STABILIZED OR APPROPRIATELY ADMITTED     OR TRANSFERRED. THERE SHOULD BE EVIDENCE OF THIS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE OR TRANSFER. THE POLICY DEFINES A QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS LICENSED OR CERTIFIED IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES AND WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED CURRENT COMPETENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A MSE: ALL STAFF PHYSICIANS, ED MID-LEVEL PRACTITIONERS, PEPCS TEAM MEMBERS (PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATORS) AND OBSTETRICAL NURSES.

2. THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE THAT SAMPLE PATIENT #2 RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATE MSE. THIS PATIENT WAS SEEN BY AN ED PHYSICIAN WHO DETERMINED THE PATIENT WAS AT RISK DUE TO HIS SUICIDAL IDEATION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. A M1 HOLD WAS PLACED AND EVALUATION BY THE PSYCHIATRIC TEAM ORDERED BUT WAS NEVER COMPLETED. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO JAIL DUE TO HIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

A. SAMPLE PATIENT #7 (MDS) DATED [DATE] AT 9:12 A.M. S/HE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE ED BY EMS AFTER AN ALTERCATION WITH HIS/HER SPOUSE AND THEN VOICED SUICIDAL IDEATION. THE PATIENT RECEIVED SEVERAL DOSES OF HALDOL DUE TO AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND WAS ALSO INTERMITTENTLY IN 4 POINT RESTRAINTS. A M1 HOLD AND PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION WAS ORDERED FOR THE PATIENT BY THE ED PHYSICIAN. THE PATIENT WAS IN THE ED UNTIL S/HE WAS DISCHARGED    TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT 4:55 P.M. DUE TO THREATENING AND ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR. THE PATIENT DID NOT RECEIVE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION BEFORE DISCHARGE.

B. DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DQM ON 09/26/12 AT 12:03 P.M. IT WAS VERIFIED THAT SAMPLE PATIENT #7 WAS A PATIENT WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION WHO DID NOT RECEIVE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AND WAS DISCHARGED    TO JAIL.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to maintain a central log that contained accurate information regarding disposition and transfer of patients who had received treatment in the Emergency Department (ED) for 5 of 18 ED records reviewed (Patients #4, #6, #17, #19 and #20).

Findings:

POLICY

According to the policy, titled Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act (EMTALA), a central log must list each individual seeking or in need of emergency services that comes to the hospital. The log must include an indication whether the individual did not consent to treatment or transfer, or was transferred, admitted     and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged   .  

1. The facility failed to maintain a complete and accurate central log of patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED), including an accurate record of patients that were admitted    , transferred or discharged   . 

a) Review of the EMTALA log, dated 08/21/16, revealed Patient #6 presented to the ED at 2:48 p.m. with a headache and eloped from the ED at 5:35 p.m. on 08/21/16. 

However, review of Patient #6's medical record showed the patient's father received discharge instructions at 5:30 p.m. and the patient was discharged    home. According the the ED Patient Discharge, dated 08/21/16 at 5:35 p.m., Registered Nurse #21 (RN) documented the patient was discharged    home with his/her family. This was in contrast to the EMTALA centralized log which noted the patient eloped.

On 08/24/16 at 10:35 a.m. an interview and record review for Patient #6 was conducted with the ED Nurse Manager (Manager #5).  Manager #5 reviewed the record and acknowledged the patient was discharged    home on 08/21/16 and did not elope. S/he stated the unit secretary would have looked for the correct disposition for Patient #6 on 08/22/16 and should have corrected it if it was inaccurate.

b) Review of the central (EMTALA) log showed Patient #4 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 4:48 p.m. for pregnancy problems.  

There was no documentation on the central log to indicate if the patient was treated, transferred, admitted     or discharged   . Specifically, the area for documenting the clinical impression, disposition and disposition date and time was left blank. 

c) Review of the EMTALA log for 08/16/16 showed Patient #17 presented at 5:46 p.m. for abdominal pain and was diagnosed    with appendicitis.  However, there was no disposition on the central log.

Review of Patient #17's Emergency Department Report, dated 08/16/16, revealed the patient had appendicitis and was to be admitted     to general surgery. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and was discharged    home on 08/17/16 at 9:15 a.m.

d) Similar findings were noted for Patients #19 and #20 regarding the facility's failure to note the disposition on the central EMTALA log.

e) An interview was conducted with Manager #5 and the Director of Critical Care & ED (Director #6) on 08/24/16 beginning at 10:15 a.m.  Director #6 stated the ED unit secretary would print the EMTALA log for the previous day after midnight.  Director #6 acknowledged there was not a process for them to go back and revisit the disposition if the patient was in the ED after midnight.  Additionally, s/he stated if the patient left the ED for a procedure (GI lab, radiology or the operating room) it would not populate the EMTALA log as the patient would not be discharged    from the ED.

BASED ON INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW, THE FACILITY FAILED TO MAINTAIN A CENTRAL LOG THAT CONTAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION REGARDING DISPOSITION AND TRANSFER OF PATIENTS WHO HAD RECEIVED TREATMENT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) FOR 5 OF 18 ED RECORDS REVIEWED (PATIENTS #4, #6, #17, #19 AND #20).

FINDINGS:

POLICY

ACCORDING TO THE POLICY, TITLED EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT &  (EMTALA), A CENTRAL LOG MUST LIST EACH INDIVIDUAL SEEKING OR IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT COMES TO THE HOSPITAL. THE LOG MUST INCLUDE AN INDICATION WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL DID NOT CONSENT TO TREATMENT OR TRANSFER, OR WAS TRANSFERRED, ADMITTED     AND TREATED, STABILIZED AND TRANSFERRED, OR DISCHARGED   .  

1. THE FACILITY FAILED TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE CENTRAL LOG OF PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED), INCLUDING AN ACCURATE RECORD OF PATIENTS THAT WERE ADMITTED    , TRANSFERRED OR DISCHARGED   . 

A) REVIEW OF THE EMTALA LOG, DATED 08/21/16, REVEALED PATIENT #6 PRESENTED TO THE ED AT 2:48 P.M. WITH A HEADACHE AND ELOPED FROM THE ED AT 5:35 P.M. ON 08/21/16. 

HOWEVER, REVIEW OF PATIENT #6'S MEDICAL RECORD SHOWED THE PATIENT'S FATHER RECEIVED DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AT 5:30 P.M. AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    HOME. ACCORDING THE THE ED PATIENT DISCHARGE, DATED 08/21/16 AT 5:35 P.M., REGISTERED NURSE #21 (RN) DOCUMENTED THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    HOME WITH HIS/HER FAMILY. THIS WAS IN CONTRAST TO THE EMTALA CENTRALIZED LOG WHICH NOTED THE PATIENT ELOPED.

ON 08/24/16 AT 10:35 A.M. AN INTERVIEW AND RECORD REVIEW FOR PATIENT #6 WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE ED NURSE MANAGER (MANAGER #5).  MANAGER #5 REVIEWED THE RECORD AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED    HOME ON 08/21/16 AND DID NOT ELOPE. S/HE STATED THE UNIT SECRETARY WOULD HAVE LOOKED FOR THE CORRECT DISPOSITION FOR PATIENT #6 ON 08/22/16 AND SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED IT IF IT WAS INACCURATE.

B) REVIEW OF THE CENTRAL (EMTALA) LOG SHOWED PATIENT #4 (MDS) DATED [DATE] AT 4:48 P.M. FOR PREGNANCY PROBLEMS.  

THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION ON THE CENTRAL LOG TO INDICATE IF THE PATIENT WAS TREATED, TRANSFERRED, ADMITTED     OR DISCHARGED   . SPECIFICALLY, THE AREA FOR DOCUMENTING THE CLINICAL IMPRESSION, DISPOSITION AND DISPOSITION DATE AND TIME WAS LEFT BLANK. 

C) REVIEW OF THE EMTALA LOG FOR 08/16/16 SHOWED PATIENT #17 PRESENTED AT 5:46 P.M. FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN AND WAS DIAGNOSED    WITH APPENDICITIS.  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION ON THE CENTRAL LOG.

REVIEW OF PATIENT #17'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REPORT, DATED 08/16/16, REVEALED THE PATIENT HAD APPENDICITIS AND WAS TO BE ADMITTED     TO GENERAL SURGERY. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY AND WAS DISCHARGED    HOME ON 08/17/16 AT 9:15 A.M.

D) SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE NOTED FOR PATIENTS #19 AND #20 REGARDING THE FACILITY'S FAILURE TO NOTE THE DISPOSITION ON THE CENTRAL EMTALA LOG.

E) AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH MANAGER #5 AND THE DIRECTOR OF CRITICAL CARE & ED (DIRECTOR #6) ON 08/24/16 BEGINNING AT 10:15 A.M.  DIRECTOR #6 STATED THE ED UNIT SECRETARY WOULD PRINT THE EMTALA LOG FOR THE PREVIOUS DAY AFTER MIDNIGHT.  DIRECTOR #6 ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS NOT A PROCESS FOR THEM TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THE DISPOSITION IF THE PATIENT WAS IN THE ED AFTER MIDNIGHT.  ADDITIONALLY, S/HE STATED IF THE PATIENT LEFT THE ED FOR A PROCEDURE (GI LAB, RADIOLOGY OR THE OPERATING ROOM) IT WOULD NOT POPULATE THE EMTALA LOG AS THE PATIENT WOULD NOT BE DISCHARGED    FROM THE ED.

Based on interviews and document review, the facility failed to ensure examination and treatment were not delayed for those patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) to receive care, as required by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). In 6 of 20 medical records reviewed, registration staff presented patients with a financial agreement to sign at the time of registration, prior to receiving a medical screening examination and receiving care. In 1 of 20 medical records reviewed, registration staff investigated discounted health care services for a patient who presented for emergency care, prior to ensuring the patient was registered in the ED and received a medical screening examination. These processes created the potential to not only delay treatment, but to discourage patients entering the ED from staying to receive care. 

This failure created the potential for negative patient outcomes and the worsening of patients' conditions as the registration process, used by some staff, required patients to review and sign a financial agreement. 

FINDINGS:

POLICY

According to the policy, EMTALA-Medical Screening Examination and Stabilizing Treatment, reasonable registration processes, including insurance information, may be followed as long as individuals are not unduly discouraged from remaining for further evaluation.  

The facility may complete its routine registration process, including inquiries about insurance coverage, provided that the inquiry does not delay medical screening or stabilizing treatment. 

The facility will train personnel to respond to individual inquiries about their financial liability. Hospital staff will encourage individuals to defer questions about financial liability until after the medical screening examination has been completed. 

DOCUMENT

The document titled, Financial Agreement, a 5 paragraph document of approximately 560 words, was used by staff as part of the registration process. The document contained a line for the patient or the patient's authorized representative to sign and a line for a witness to sign and write the date and time the agreement was signed by both parties. 

The 1st paragraph of the Financial Agreement stated, in part, patients will pay the account or make financial arrangements satisfactory to the facility ""and/or any other providers for payment unless the patient's bill is paid by applicable insurance, governmental programs or other sources. If an account is sent to an attorney for collection, I agree to pay reasonable attorney's fees and collection expenses in addition to the amount due and owing on the bill for health services rendered to the patient. I understand and agree that a delinquent account will be subject to interest at the legal rate."" 

The agreement stated, in paragraph 2, that insurance would be billed for medical services rendered to the patient, and payment from the insurer would be sought by the facility before the insured would be required to make payments, with the exception of applicable co-payments and deductibles, which, it stated, the patient or the insurance holder must pay. The agreement stated, ""I understand and agree that I am responsible for and will pay for medical services rendered to the patient in the event that our insurance does not authorize these services or does not pay for these services."" The agreement stated the signing party agrees to normal business communication from the facility, regarding payment, through letter, email, telephone, test, voice message, or any other available technologies used by businesses. 

The agreement stated, in part, in paragraph 3, ""It is understood and agreed, however, that the patient and I are primarily responsible for payment of the patient's bill and that we are obligated to pay and agree to pay for any portion of the bill not paid for by insurance and other sources."" 

The agreement stated, in paragraph 5, in the event that the patient and/or the representative have made a payment on an active account, whether through cash, check, credit card or other means, and there remains additional funds available after that account is satisfied (e.g. an overpayment), the facility is authorized to apply the overpayment to any other account owed by the patient that remains unpaid.

According to the job description, Patient Financial Services Representative (PFS), these employees explain and obtain signatures on the facility's legal forms including Financial Agreements. The PFS employees perform all functions according to established policies,  procedures, and regulatory requirements. PFS employees use sound judgement to prioritize work and to ensure appropriateness and timeliness of each patient's care.

1. A PFS representative failed to ensure care was not delayed for Patient #2, who presented to the facility seeking emergency treatment for an injury. Patient #2 was bleeding from a hand laceration when s/he entered the facility. 

a) Review of the medical record for Patient #2 revealed the patient was registered at the Emergency Department (ED) at 4:19 p.m., with the chief complaint being a laceration on the right palm. The record revealed the laceration was approximately 2 centimeters and had a large amount of ""super glue"" on the laceration. The patient stated s/he sustained an injury to his/her hand from a door the previous night. The patient was unsure of the date of his/her most recent tetanus shot. 

b) Review of the document, MS4 Passport, revealed the patient came to ""the front"" of the facility and was screened for, and qualified for, discounted health care services. The MS4 document revealed PFS #1 gave the patient booklets regarding the discounted health care services. 

c) On 12/16/15 at 8:22 a.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated s/he received EMTALA training as a new employee and annually thereafter. PFS #1 stated in meetings with his/her direct supervisor and with other PFS employees, no EMTALA issues or concerns had been discussed since the facility opened. PFS #1 stated patients do enter the main door to the facility, instead of the door to the ED, seeking emergency care. S/he stated recently, a patient entered the main door to the facility with a hand laceration and was bleeding from the wound. PFS #1 stated per his/her training, s/he escorted the patient back to the ED desk for registration and to be seen for his/her injury. 

d) On 12/16/15 at 1:59 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated the patient with the hand laceration was Patient #2. PFS #1 reviewed the MS4 Passport document for this patient and confirmed s/he had seen the patient at the main entrance to the facility on   the day the patient entered, bleeding, and seeking emergency care. PFS #1 stated the patient was concerned about the cost of care for the ED visit. In response to this concern, PFS #1 contacted a lead financial staff person by phone for assistance and together they began the process of obtaining discounted heath care for the patient. PFS #1 stated the patient continued to bleed from his/her hand laceration during this time. PFS #1 stated s/he was with the patient for ""quite a while"" at the front registration desk before walking the patient back to the ED for registration. PFS #1 stated 4:19 p.m. was the time the patient arrived at the ED registration desk and not the time the patient arrived at the main entrance to the facility seeking care. PFS #1 could not state what time the patient entered the main entrance to the facility. 

e) On 12/16/15 at 9:05 a.m., an interview was conducted with the PFS Supervisor, PFS #2. The supervisor stated if a patient entered the facility seeking emergency care but did not wish to be registered until knowing the cost of the ED visit, his/her staff had been trained to respond to these patients by encouraging the patients to stay and be seen by the clinical staff so they could ""feel better first"" before discussing the cost of care. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should not conduct ""insurance work-up"" for any ED patient until the patient had received a medical screening examination. The Supervisor stated this was part of the PFS staffs' training. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should call for a Registered Nurse to come to the registration area in order to see and speak with any patient who presented to the ED but did not wish to register for any reason, including for financial reasons. 

The Supervisor stated the registration process for patients who entered the facility through the main entrance seeking emergency care was the same as for those patients who entered through the ED. The Supervisor stated the PFS staff would escort a patient from the main entrance of the facility to the ED to register at the ED desk. PFS staff could ask the patient's name and phone the ED registration desk to inform staff they were bringing a patient back, or would simply escort the patient back to the ED. The Supervisor stated PFS staff should not delay these patients being registered and seen by clinical staff in order to receive a Medical Screening Examination

2. Registration staff gave patients, who presented to the ED seeking care, a financial agreement to read and sign as part of the registration process, prior to receiving a medical screening examination in 6 of 20 medical record reviewed (Patients #1, #6, #7, #8, #16, and #17). This process was used for patients who presented to the ED with complaints such as chest pain and shortness of breath, abdominal cramping and dizziness, fever and vomiting, and seizure activity. This registration process failed to ensure patients' medical screening examinations and care were not delayed and could have discouraged some patients from staying to receive a medical screening examination and care.  

a) Review of the medical records and the MS4 Passport registration documents was conducted for a sample of 20, ED and Obstetrics (OB) patients. 

i) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #1 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, and feeling ""very"" disoriented, since experiencing sharp chest pain approximately 1.5 hours prior to entering the ED. The history and physical revealed the patient had no prior history of this type of event. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 6:26 a.m., and the Financial Agreement was signed by the patient's spouse at 6:29 a.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 6:31 a.m. 

ii) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #6 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, head ache, and dizziness. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 5:16 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 5:19 p.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 5:35 p.m. 

iii) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #7 revealed the patient, a child, was brought to the ED by his/her parent with complaints of fever and vomiting x 6. Document review revealed the patient and parent entered the ED and the patient was registered at 2:48 p.m. Review of the Financial Agreement revealed the parent signed the agreement at 4:30 p.m., which was the time of the patient's discharge from the ED. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement. 

The MS4 registration documented contained a statement from PFS #1 that the MS4 system was not able to be accessed and s/he printed a hard copy of the Financial Agreement for the parent to sign. PFS #1 documented the parent did not stop by the desk at the time of discharge (4:30 p.m.) and s/he was unable to update the patient's demographics or obtain insurance information from the parent.   

On 12/16/15 at 1:48 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who reviewed the registration documents for Patient #7 and stated the Financial Agreement was signed by the patient's parent at the time of registration (2:48 p.m.) and not at the time of discharge from the ED at 4:30 p.m., as documented. PFS #1 confirmed s/he wrote in the time of 4:30 p.m. as  the time both s/he and the parent signed the Financial Agreement. PFS #1 stated the time of 4:30 p.m. did not represent the time the document was actually signed. 

iv) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #8 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of flank pain and a history of kidney stones. 
Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 3:26 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 3:30 p.m. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at this time. The patient received a medical screening examination at 3:42 p.m. 

v) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #16 revealed the patient came to the ED with complaints of heroin use, the desire to begin a detox program, and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and non-compliance with medications prescribed for bipolar disorder. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 5:28 p.m., and signed the Financial Agreement at 5:00 p.m., 28 minutes prior to being registered in the ED. PFS #1 signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement at 5:00 p.m.. The patient received a medical screening examination at 5:38 p.m. At 9:10 p.m., the ED record revealed the patient eloped from the ED by walking out of the examination room. The patient was documented as ""stable"" at the time of elopement. No reason was documented in the medical record or in the MS4 system stating why the patient left the ED. 

vi) Review of the medical record and the MS4 registration documents for Patient #17 revealed the patient came to the ED by ambulance with complaints of seizure activity. Document review revealed the patient entered the ED, was registered at 10:45 p.m., and gave documented ""verbal"" agreement to the Financial Agreement at 11:00 p.m., which was witness and signed by 2 staff members. PFS #2 was 1 of 2 staff who signed and witnessed the Financial Agreement. 

RN #4 conducted a neurological assessment of the patient at 10:52 p.m., at which time s/he documented the patient was slow to answer questions, was drowsy, and had slurred speech. The RN documented the patient was confused, disoriented, and had tremors. The patient received a medical screening examination at 11:08 p.m. The physician documented at this time the patient presented with alcohol withdrawal, was shaky, and confused.  

b) On 12/16/15 at 9:39 a.m., an interview was conducted with the PFS Supervisor, PFS #2. The Supervisor stated the Financial Agreement for patients who entered the ED seeking care should not be signed at the time of initial registration if patients were experiencing issues such as chest pain or symptoms of stroke, for example. The Supervisor stated for patients not stating issues of this nature, but less serious issues, the registration process did not prohibit PFS staff from obtaining the patient's signature on the Financial Agreement. The Supervisor stated PFS staff did not have clinical background or training to enable them to make judgements at the registration desk regarding patients' presenting symptoms. The Supervisor stated s/he observed PFS staffs' work and processes approximately once each month, for each staff person, and had not noted issues with the registration process being carried out as PFS staff had been trained. 

c) On 12/16/15 at 1:48 p.m., an interview was conducted with PFS #1 who stated s/he was trained and instructed by his/her supervisor to obtain signed Financial Agreements from patients at the time of discharge or at the patient's bedside in the ED once patients had received a medical screening examination. PFS #1 stated s/he had patients sign the Financial Agreement document at the same time patients signed the consent to treatment document, at initial registration, because it was an easier process to carry out. PFS #1 confirmed his/her signature as the witness on the Financial Agreements for 5 of the 6 patients reviewed (Patients #1, #6, #7, #8, and #16).  

d) On 12/16/15 at 2:06 p.m., an interview was conducted with the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Employee #3, who stated s/he had been assured by staff the registration process in the ED was one that met all EMTALA requirements. The COO stated s/he had ultimate responsibility for the processes used in the facility and the care provided to patients in the facility.

The COO stated obtaining financial information from patients and discussion of the financial piece of the ED visit should be conducted at the time of discharge from the ED. The COO stated this included obtaining patients' signatures on the Financial Agreement, as having this document signed at the time of initial registration could delay the medical screening examination and patient care. The COO stated PFS staff were not clinical and therefore could not make a judgement of which patients could sign this document at the time of registration and which should not sign due to the nature of their symptoms and chief complaint. The COO stated presenting the Financial Agreement to patients at the time of registration could deter some patients from staying to receive care, due to the nature of the document. 

The COO stated s/he had no knowledge that Patient #2 was screened for discounted health care prior to being registered and seen in the ED. The COO stated Patient #2 should have been escorted to the ED to be registered to receive care and PFS staff should not have spent time investigating discounted health care before the patient was registered and received care.

The COO stated s/he was unaware of the practice by some PFS staff of presenting the Financial Agreement document for patient review and for signatures at the time of initial registration. The COO stated the process for registering patients in the ED was to obtain the patients' name, date of birth, and the name of the primary care physician, if the patient had one.  The COO referred to this process as ""quick registration"" and stated this was the process the PFS staff should be using at all times.

BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND DOCUMENT REVIEW, THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT WERE NOT DELAYED FOR THOSE PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) TO RECEIVE CARE, AS REQUIRED BY THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND  (EMTALA). IN 6 OF 20 MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEWED, REGISTRATION STAFF PRESENTED PATIENTS WITH A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT TO SIGN AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION, PRIOR TO RECEIVING A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION AND RECEIVING CARE. IN 1 OF 20 MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEWED, REGISTRATION STAFF INVESTIGATED DISCOUNTED HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR A PATIENT WHO PRESENTED FOR EMERGENCY CARE, PRIOR TO ENSURING THE PATIENT WAS REGISTERED IN THE ED AND RECEIVED A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION. THESE PROCESSES CREATED THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY DELAY TREATMENT, BUT TO DISCOURAGE PATIENTS ENTERING THE ED FROM STAYING TO RECEIVE CARE. 

THIS FAILURE CREATED THE POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND THE WORSENING OF PATIENTS' CONDITIONS AS THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USED BY SOME STAFF, REQUIRED PATIENTS TO REVIEW AND SIGN A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT. 

FINDINGS:

POLICY

ACCORDING TO THE POLICY, EMTALA-MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION AND STABILIZING TREATMENT, REASONABLE REGISTRATION PROCESSES, INCLUDING INSURANCE INFORMATION, MAY BE FOLLOWED AS LONG AS INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT UNDULY DISCOURAGED FROM REMAINING FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.  

THE FACILITY MAY COMPLETE ITS ROUTINE REGISTRATION PROCESS, INCLUDING INQUIRIES ABOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE, PROVIDED THAT THE INQUIRY DOES NOT DELAY MEDICAL SCREENING OR STABILIZING TREATMENT. 

THE FACILITY WILL TRAIN PERSONNEL TO RESPOND TO INDIVIDUAL INQUIRIES ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL LIABILITY. HOSPITAL STAFF WILL ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO DEFER QUESTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL LIABILITY UNTIL AFTER THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

PFS #1 STATED IN MEETINGS WITH HIS/HER DIRECT SUPERVISOR AND WITH OTHER PFS EMPLOYEES, NO EMTALA ISSUES OR CONCERNS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED SINCE THE FACILITY OPENED. PFS #1 STATED PATIENTS DO ENTER THE MAIN DOOR TO THE FACILITY, INSTEAD OF THE DOOR TO THE ED, SEEKING EMERGENCY CARE. S/HE STATED RECENTLY, A PATIENT ENTERED THE MAIN DOOR TO THE FACILITY WITH A HAND LACERATION AND WAS BLEEDING FROM THE WOUND. PFS #1 STATED PER HIS/HER TRAINING, S/HE ESCORTED THE PATIENT BACK TO THE ED DESK FOR REGISTRATION AND TO BE SEEN FOR HIS/HER INJURY. 

D) ON 12/16/15 AT 1:59 P.M., AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH PFS #1 WHO STATED THE PATIENT WITH THE HAND LACERATION WAS PATIENT #2.

PFS #1 COULD NOT STATE WHAT TIME THE PATIENT ENTERED THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE FACILITY. 

E) ON 12/16/15 AT 9:05 A.M., AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PFS SUPERVISOR, PFS #2. THE SUPERVISOR STATED IF A PATIENT ENTERED THE FACILITY SEEKING EMERGENCY CARE BUT DID NOT WISH TO BE REGISTERED UNTIL KNOWING THE COST OF THE ED VISIT, HIS/HER STAFF HAD BEEN TRAINED TO RESPOND TO THESE PATIENTS BY ENCOURAGING THE PATIENTS TO STAY AND BE SEEN BY THE CLINICAL STAFF SO THEY COULD ""FEEL BETTER FIRST"" BEFORE DISCUSSING THE COST OF CARE. THE SUPERVISOR STATED PFS STAFF SHOULD NOT CONDUCT ""INSURANCE WORK-UP"" FOR ANY ED PATIENT UNTIL THE PATIENT HAD RECEIVED A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION. THE SUPERVISOR STATED THIS WAS PART OF THE PFS STAFFS' TRAINING. THE SUPERVISOR STATED PFS STAFF SHOULD CALL FOR A REGISTERED NURSE TO COME TO THE REGISTRATION AREA IN ORDER TO SEE AND SPEAK WITH ANY PATIENT WHO PRESENTED TO THE ED BUT DID NOT WISH TO REGISTER FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING FOR FINANCIAL REASONS.

THE SUPERVISOR STATED FOR PATIENTS NOT STATING ISSUES OF THIS NATURE, BUT LESS SERIOUS ISSUES, THE REGISTRATION PROCESS DID NOT PROHIBIT PFS STAFF FROM OBTAINING THE PATIENT'S SIGNATURE ON THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT. THE SUPERVISOR STATED PFS STAFF DID NOT HAVE CLINICAL BACKGROUND OR TRAINING TO ENABLE THEM TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS AT THE REGISTRATION DESK REGARDING PATIENTS' PRESENTING SYMPTOMS. THE SUPERVISOR STATED S/HE OBSERVED PFS STAFFS' WORK AND PROCESSES APPROXIMATELY ONCE EACH MONTH, FOR EACH STAFF PERSON, AND HAD NOT NOTED ISSUES WITH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS BEING CARRIED OUT AS PFS STAFF HAD BEEN TRAINED.

THE COO STATED THIS INCLUDED OBTAINING PATIENTS' SIGNATURES ON THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT, AS HAVING THIS DOCUMENT SIGNED AT THE TIME OF INITIAL REGISTRATION COULD DELAY THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION AND PATIENT CARE. THE COO STATED PFS STAFF WERE NOT CLINICAL AND THEREFORE COULD NOT MAKE A JUDGEMENT OF WHICH PATIENTS COULD SIGN THIS DOCUMENT AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION AND WHICH SHOULD NOT SIGN DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR SYMPTOMS AND CHIEF COMPLAINT. THE COO STATED PRESENTING THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT TO PATIENTS AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION COULD DETER SOME PATIENTS FROM STAYING TO RECEIVE CARE, DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE DOCUMENT. 

THE COO STATED S/HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT PATIENT #2 WAS SCREENED FOR DISCOUNTED HEALTH CARE PRIOR TO BEING REGISTERED AND SEEN IN THE ED. THE COO STATED PATIENT #2 SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESCORTED TO THE ED TO BE REGISTERED TO RECEIVE CARE AND PFS STAFF SHOULD NOT HAVE SPENT TIME INVESTIGATING DISCOUNTED HEALTH CARE BEFORE THE PATIENT WAS REGISTERED AND RECEIVED CARE.

THE COO STATED S/HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE PRACTICE BY SOME PFS STAFF OF PRESENTING THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT DOCUMENT FOR PATIENT REVIEW AND FOR SIGNATURES AT THE TIME OF INITIAL REGISTRATION. THE COO STATED THE PROCESS FOR REGISTERING PATIENTS IN THE ED WAS TO OBTAIN THE PATIENTS' NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, AND THE NAME OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, IF THE PATIENT HAD ONE.  THE COO REFERRED TO THIS PROCESS AS ""QUICK REGISTRATION"" AND STATED THIS WAS THE PROCESS THE PFS STAFF SHOULD BE USING AT ALL TIMES.

Based on interview, review of patient records, policies and procedures, and the central log, the facility failed to maintain a log which included one (Patient #1)  of 25 patients sampled seeking treatment  in the hospital's Emergency Department.

Findings:  

Review of the Emergency Department (ED) log from 5/7/2017 through 5/11/2017 revealed that Patient #1 was not in the Emergency Log.

Review of the medical record revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 2:00 AM. The patient approached staff in the registration area and requested medical treatment. The form presented to the hospital and signed by the midwife showed Patient #1 was sent by the midwife for a 3rd degree perineal tear following a home birth.  

Documentation by the ED Registered Nurse (RN) on 5/9/2017 at 2:00 AM revealed that an ED-OB (Emergency Department)-(Obstetrics) hand off sheet showed Patient #1 was sent to the ED for sutures following a home birth. Patient #1 was transported to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery (LDR) unit at 2:14 AM without a medical screening in the ED.  

During a telephone interview on 5/22/2017 at 5:46 PM, Staff X (Staff in the ED who had Patient #1) stated there was no policy for a patient presenting to the ED after giving birth at home. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 11:05 AM, Staff P stated that Patient #1 should have been seen in the ED before being sent to LDR Unit. Staff P stated they never had a patient from home present to either the ED or LDR after giving birth at home. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 3:15 PM,  Staff Z stated she called the LDR regarding the patient. Patient #1 was not put in the emergency log or seen by a physician/mid-level provider before going to the LDR unit.

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 1:15 PM, Staff Y stated that any post partum patient should be seen in the ED first. Patients who have any kind of vaginal tear need to have an evaluation in the ED first. All patients presenting to the ED are to have a medical screening exam and, if needed, the on-call physician for the specialty needed is then called. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 10:55 AM, Staff O stated that a post partum patient should be seen in the ED before being sent to the LDR unit. When a patient needs a vaginal repair, the patient would go to the operating room  for the laceration repair. Most post partum patients are admitted     through the ED and then go to the operating room (OR). 

Review of the facility's Policy and Procedure, titled ""Medical Screening and Treatment/Transfer Policy (EMTALA)"" revealed  Emergency Department Log, each hospital must maintain a central log to track the care provided to each individual who comes to the hospital seeking care for an emergency condition. The log entry must be made at the first point of contact and must contain the name of the patient, and the disposition of the patient as patient stabilized.

REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL RECORD REVEALED THAT PATIENT #1 (MDS) DATED [DATE] AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 AM. THE PATIENT APPROACHED STAFF IN THE REGISTRATION AREA AND REQUESTED MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE FORM PRESENTED TO THE HOSPITAL AND SIGNED BY THE MIDWIFE SHOWED PATIENT #1 WAS SENT BY THE MIDWIFE FOR A 3RD DEGREE PERINEAL TEAR FOLLOWING A HOME BIRTH.  

DOCUMENTATION BY THE ED REGISTERED NURSE (RN) ON 5/9/2017 AT 2:00 AM REVEALED THAT AN ED-OB (EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT)-(OBSTETRICS) HAND OFF SHEET SHOWED PATIENT #1 WAS SENT TO THE ED FOR SUTURES FOLLOWING A HOME BIRTH. PATIENT #1 WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE LABOR/DELIVERY/RECOVERY (LDR) UNIT AT 2:14 AM WITHOUT A MEDICAL SCREENING IN THE ED.  

DURING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW ON 5/22/2017 AT 5:46 PM, STAFF X (STAFF IN THE ED WHO HAD PATIENT #1) STATED THERE WAS NO POLICY FOR A PATIENT PRESENTING TO THE ED AFTER GIVING BIRTH AT HOME. 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 5/22/2017 AT 11:05 AM, STAFF P STATED THAT PATIENT #1 SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE ED BEFORE BEING SENT TO LDR UNIT. STAFF P STATED THEY NEVER HAD A PATIENT FROM HOME PRESENT TO EITHER THE ED OR LDR AFTER GIVING BIRTH AT HOME.

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 5/22/2017 AT 1:15 PM, STAFF Y STATED THAT ANY POST PARTUM PATIENT SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE ED FIRST. PATIENTS WHO HAVE ANY KIND OF VAGINAL TEAR NEED TO HAVE AN EVALUATION IN THE ED FIRST. ALL PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE ED ARE TO HAVE A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM AND, IF NEEDED, THE ON-CALL PHYSICIAN FOR THE SPECIALTY NEEDED IS THEN CALLED. 

DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 5/22/2017 AT 10:55 AM, STAFF O STATED THAT A POST PARTUM PATIENT SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE ED BEFORE BEING SENT TO THE LDR UNIT. WHEN A PATIENT NEEDS A VAGINAL REPAIR, THE PATIENT WOULD GO TO THE OPERATING ROOM  FOR THE LACERATION REPAIR. MOST POST PARTUM PATIENTS ARE ADMITTED     THROUGH THE ED AND THEN GO TO THE OPERATING ROOM (OR). 

REVIEW OF THE FACILITY'S POLICY AND PROCEDURE, TITLED ""MEDICAL SCREENING AND TREATMENT/TRANSFER POLICY (EMTALA)"" REVEALED  EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT LOG, EACH HOSPITAL MUST MAINTAIN A CENTRAL LOG TO TRACK THE CARE PROVIDED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO COMES TO THE HOSPITAL SEEKING CARE FOR AN EMERGENCY CONDITION. THE LOG ENTRY MUST BE MADE AT THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT AND MUST CONTAIN THE NAME OF THE PATIENT, AND THE DISPOSITION OF THE PATIENT AS PATIENT STABILIZED.

Based on interview, review of medical record, and policies and procedures, the hospital failed to provide a Medical Screening Examination for one (Patient #1) of 25 sampled patients presenting to the hospital's Emergency Department (ED) to determine if an emergency medical condition existed. This failure presented a substantial probability of adversely affecting the health and safety of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department.

Findings:

Review of the medical record revealed that Patient #1 (MDS) dated [DATE] at approximately 2:00 AM. The patient approached registration area and informed the Emergency Department staff requesting medical treatment. The form signed by the midwife showed Patient #1 was sent by the midwife for a 3rd degree perineal tear following a home birth.  

Documentation by the ED Registered Nurse (RN) on 5/9/2017 at 2:00 AM revealed that an ED-OB( Emergency Department)-(Obstetrics) hand off sheet showed Patient #1 included the birth of the baby at home and the need to have sutures. A form signed by a midwife stated the patient had a 3rd degree perineal tear, time of delivery 2245 on 5/8/17. Patient #1 was transported to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery (LDR) unit at 2:14 AM. There was no documentation in the patient's medical record to indicate Patient #1 was medically screened  in the ED by a physician/mid-level prior to being sent to the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit. 

Documentation by the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit nurse on 5/9/2017 at 2:15 AM revealed that the patient arrived to the Unit after a home birth (assisted by a mid-wife). At 2:16 AM a physical  by the LDR RN was performed on Patient #1 that revealed the perineum appears to  have a 3rd degree laceration from perineum extending into the vagina. At 2:20 AM, a call/page was made to the on-call physician for walk-in's. The physician was informed of the need for repair of a possible 3rd degree laceration following a vaginal home birth. The physician refused to come in and repair the laceration. The physician gave orders for the patient to follow up in the office in the morning. The Labor/Delivery/Recovery nurse stated again to the on-call physician that he was requested to come in to the facility to repair the laceration. The on-call physician stated again no. The charge nurse of the LDR Unit was aware of the situation.  A call was placed to the hospital house supervisor regarding what the on-call physician had told the RN in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit. At 5:02 AM, both verbal/written instructions were given to Patient #1 to go to the on-call physician's office in the morning for the laceration repair. Patient #1 stated she would not be seeing this physician. A repeat phone call was made to the on-call physician that Patient #1 was refusing to leave until the laceration was repaired. The physician was told that the ED was not willing to do the repair, as it was not in their area of expertise. The on-call physician stated he had explained to the RN in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit to send patient home and follow up in the morning in his office. The RN again explained that the patient was requesting the laceration be repaired. The physician stated that an episiotomy was not an emergency. Patient #1 was given information and discharged    home. 

A review of the medical record showed: Review of symptoms: Drainage at perineum site small. Perineum revealed a 3rd degree laceration to perineum extending to the vaginal area. BP (Blood Pressure) 142/76, and pulse 110, shows small amount of drainage and no clots. Discharge vitals include BP 125/63 and pulse of 105. Review of post care instructions shows that the peripad was changed and had small amount of drainage. Further discharge instructions included patient to go the on-call physician's office to have laceration repaired and patient refused. 

Patient #1 followed up on 05/09/2017 with another obstetrician who took the patient to surgery and repaired the perineal tear in the Munroe Regional Medical Center operating room and discharged    her home the same day.

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 11:05 AM, Staff P stated that Patient #1 should have been seen in the ED before being sent to LDR Unit. Staff P stated they never had a patient from home present to either the ED or LDR before. 

During a telephone interview on 5/22/2017 at 2:55 PM, Staff S (The RN who was taking care of Patient #1 in the LDR Unit) stated that on 5/9/2017 at 2:15 AM, after Patient #1 was brought to the LDR after having a baby at home by a midwife. She had called the on-call physician and he stated would not come in for the repair. The discharge instructions by the on-call physician was for Patient #1 to come to the office in morning for repair of the laceration. Staff S stated that she had also called the house supervisor and was waiting for her to call back.

During a telephone interview on 5/23/2017 at 11:30 AM, Staff U (Supervisor on-call on 5/9/2017) stated that they had a conversation with Labor/Delivery/Recovery Unit charge nurse regarding Patient #1. Patient #1 could stay in the LDR Unit until morning and get the laceration repair. Staff U had spoken to the physician on-call. The physician on-call still stated it was not an emergency and the patient could be discharged    home and seen in his office in the AM for the laceration repair. Staff U stated to the physician on-call that LDR staff were uncomfortable and needed Patient #1 to be seen. The vital signs were within normal parameters and drainage was minimal. Patient # 1 decided to leave. 

During an interview on 5/22/2017 at 1:15 PM, Staff Y stated that any post-partum patient should be seen in the ED first. Patients who have any kind of vaginal tear need to have an evaluation in the ED first. All patients presenting to the ED are to have a medical screening exam and, if needed, the on-call physician for the specialty needed, is then called. 

A review of the on-call physician for week of 5/8/2017 to 5/14/2017 and review of the on-call schedule for Labor/Delivery/Recovery and ED validated that on 5/9/2017 Staff V was the physician on-call for walk-in's. 

Review of the facility's Policy and Procedure, titled  ""Medical Screening and Treatment/Transfer Policy (EMTALA)"" revealed  Emergency Department Log: Each hospital must maintain a central log to track the care provided to each individual who comes to the hospital seeking care for an emergency condition. The log entry must be made at the first point of contact and must contain the name of the patient, and the disposition of the patient as patient stabilized.

Based on observation, reviews of medical records, policies and procedures, daily activity sheet and staff interviews, the facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was provided that was within the capability of the hospital ' s emergency department.  This includes ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed after the presentation status had changed while still on hospital property  for 1 (patient #1) of 26 medical records reviewed.

Findings:

1. Interview with the complainant on 08/08/2014 at 10:30 AM revealed the patient #1 had gone shopping with her sister and her mother on 07/29/2014 and she complained of headaches and body pain.  The patient ' s family believed that something was not right and convinced the patient to go the emergency room    (ER) for an evaluation.  The family drove the patient to the ER.  The patient was able to walk from the car to the reception desk.  Patient #1 was subsequently admitted     to another acute care facility (#3) and was in the Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator having seizures according to the complainant.

2. Patient #1 ' s medical record from Lake City Medical Center was reviewed.  Review of the form  "" Emergency Patient Record ""  revealed that patient #1 arrived to the Emergency Department and walked to the reception desk and was signed in at 18:30 (6:30 p.m.).  Patient #1 was triaged (degree of urgency to illness to decide the order of treatment) by a triage nurse as semi -urgent. The patient ' s vital signs at 18:55 (6:55 p.m.) taken by the triage nurse was listed as: Blood Pressure: 148/75; Pulse: 100; Respirations: 18; temperature: 98.1 Pain level -8 (pain scale 0-10 -0 no pain and 10 being the worst pain).  At 18:34 (6:34 p.m.) the patient was taken to a room where she concurrently received a medical screening examination by triage Physician ' s  Assistant, (PA).  Review of the patient ' s medical record indicated that family was not present during the medical screening examination (MSE) and was not interviewed by either the PA or the triage nurse.  Review  of the   "" Emergency Provider Report ""  (EPR) , dated 7/29/2014 at 1855 (6:55 p.m.), indicated that patient #1 presented with  "" complaint: right  arm pain after drinking juice last night ... the quality of the patient ' s pain was documented as aching, severely moderate and the pain was exacerbated by range of motion. The review of systems sections indicated in part,  "" Gastrointestinal: diarrhea (one episode yesterday) Musculoskeletal: extremity pain right arm.  The PA documented in part, Physical examination:  "" Extremities: assessment  ... patient (pt.) had mild pain with passive and active pronation and supination of right arm. MDM (Medical Decision Making).  Prob-non-Trauma-ED course: pt...  course-pt...  had FROM (Full Range of Motion) of right Fingers/arm/hand /wrist /shoulders w (with)/neuro- vascular exam (examination). ""  The PA documented that the medical screening examination was normal. The patient was then asked to wait in the ER  (emergency room   ) waiting room until the admission clerk could talk to them. The medical record also revealed that at 18:58 (6:58 P.M.) the patient walked to the waiting room on her own power and with a normal gait.  The medical record revealed a document titled NON-URGENT MSE DETERMINATION that the top section  "" ER  Physician  "" was signed by the ER  physician at 1853 (6:53 p.m.)  7/29/2014 stating that  "" Medical Screening COMPLETE: immediate medical attention not necessary: no acute symptoms of sufficient severity or a woman in active labor found: no immediate serious impairment or dysfunction or organs is reasonably expected. ""   The lower section of the form: ER  REGISTRAR was signed by the registrar at 1914 (7:14 p.m.) by the registrar and revealed  "" Patient elects not to continue medical care with this facility and care givers at this time.  Patient provided with information related to alternate community medical resources.  ""   Further review of the medical record revealed that the patient was walked back to the ER  Registrar desk.  The document revealed that the patient physically left the building at 1914 (7:14 p.m.). 

3. Review of the Daily Activity Sheet completed by the Security Guard dated 7/29/2014 revealed the following entry at 1940 (7:40 p.m.)   "" Called to admitting, person will not leave the admitting office- Lake City Police Department (LCPD) called to remove person from admitting office-Person will not talk-sister may cause problems-Police arrived at 1950 (7:50 p.m.)  -remove person from admitting office "" .


4. Review of the EMS Pre-hospital Care Report Summary dated 07/29/2014 revealed that the patient ' s initial vital signs were BP 189/105, P 130  (normal pulse 60-100) R- 22 and BS 301. Review of the Narrative History Text revealed,  "" MEDIC 1 DISPATCHED TO LCMC  (Lake City Medical Center) FOR A pt.. (Patient #1) IN THE PARKING LOT. UPON ARRIVAL pt.. FOUND IN A WHEELCHAIR.  ER  STAFF WAS WAITING OUTSIDE WITH PAT (Patient #1). STAFF STATED WAS SEEN FOR SHOULDER PAIN AND discharged   . pt.. THEN COMPLAINED OF WEAKNESS AND WAS SITTING IN THE LOBBY REFUSING TO LEAVE LCMC.

5.  Review of the ER  record obtained from Acute care facility #2 dated 07/30/2014 at 0517 (5:17 a.m.) revealed as part of the Physician Documentation  "" Patient arrives via EMS from Lake City Medical Center ED with unresponsiveness.  History per EMS is that the patient was seen in the Lake City Medical Center (LCMC) triage and told she did not have an emergency and was wheeled out to the Ambulance by LCMC staff in a wheelchair and was unresponsive upon their arrival.  The report giving 2 mg of IV Narcan (medication that reverses effects of other narcotic medicines) with no response.  The family reports the following; patient had N/v/d (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) yesterday, with headache, pain in the back of neck and upper back radiating to the right shoulder.  She continued to have N/V today and family states that she was  "" not acting right  "" .  They described her (patient#1) as being somewhat unfocused and confused with global generalized weakness.  Unknown if patient had a fever or not. Onset of the symptoms/episode became/occurred yesterday, and became worse just prior to arrival. Severity of symptoms: At their worst the symptoms were incapacitating in the emergency department, the symptoms are unchanged.  The patient has not experienced similar symptoms in the past.  The patient has been recently seen by a physician at Lake City Medical Center earlier today, with similar presenting complaints, was MSE ' d (medically screened) and determined not be non-emergent.  "" Review of the TRANSFER CERTIFICATION FORM completed by Acute care facility #2 on 07/03/2014 at 0515 (5:15 a.m.) revealed the reason for transfer to Acute care Facility #3 was to treat patient #1 ' s diagnosis of Meningitis.

6. The Discharge Summary from acute care facility #3 was reviewed.  Review of the discharge summary dated 8/18/2014 revealed in part,  "" Secondary Diagnosis: Vasospasm of cerebral artery, Diabetes Mellitus, meningitis due to bacteria, seizure.   ...Hospital Course ... [AGE] year old female  ... transferred from Acute Care Facility #2 ...for management of meningitis. The patient underwent LP and CT at Hospital B ...Upon transfer the patient was admitted     to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and intubated for failure to protect airway.  There she was noted to have left sided weakness; demonstrated abnormal perfusion in the right MCA (Mid Cerebral Artery) and PCA (Posterior Cerebral Artery)which was diagnosed    as vasospasm secondary to meningitis .... She experienced one seizure that lasted 90 seconds ...she was subsequently started on fosphention (medication used to treat seizures) (per neurology for 3-6 months) ...Discharge instructions: PT. (physical Therapy) OT (Occupational Therapy): Physical/Occupational inpatient rehabilitation 
Nursing Home/Rehab: Physical/Occupational rehab. ""



7. The facility ' s policy titled  "" EMTALA- Florida medical Screening Examination and Stabilization Policy ""  Policy #900.036 effective date 2/20/97 was reviewed. The policy specified in part,  "" Definitions: Services Capability: means all services offered by the hospital where identification of services offered is evidenced by the appearance of the service in a medical record ...  Relieve or Eliminate the Emergency Medical Condition means the provision of care treatment  ...consistent with the applicable standard of care, by a physician necessary to either eliminate the emergency medical condition or to eliminate the likelihood that the emergency medical condition will deteriorate or recur without further medical attention within a reasonable period of time ...  Procedure:  WHEN A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION IS RQUIRED: An individual MUST receive a MSE within the capabilities of the hospital ' s DED (dedicated Emergency Department) to determine whether or not an EMC exists ....1. the individual comes to the dedicated emergency department  of a hospital and a request is made on his or her behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition,  Extent of the MSE (Medical Screening Examination): 2. No difference by location: The MSE performed on hospital property other than a DED must be the same medical screening that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospitals DED with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individual ' s ability to pay for medical care ...5 Varies by presenting symptoms. The facility is required only to perform such medical screening within the scope of its capabilities as would be appropriate for any individual presenting at the DED in that matter to determine that the individual does have an EMC. A. Depending on the individual ' s presenting symptoms, the MSE may range from  a simple process invoilving  only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that also involves performing ancillary studies and procedures such as (but not limited to) lumbar punctures, clinical laboratory tests, CT scans and other diagnostic tests and procedures.



8.  An interview with the triage PA on 08/08/2014 at 12:30 PM revealed that I work both as the triage  PA and the ER  PA  to help out in the back until the second PA comes in at 12 noon if I am not busy. I determine if the person is to be seen in the emergency room    by the physician.  Every non-emergency patient is discussed with the physician except for suture removals. The patients do not discuss in triage if they are going to be seen in the ER  or not.  I make the determination then they go to registration, registration gives them the determination that was made and their options.  If the person insists on being seen the charge nurse in the ER  gets involved.  Continued interview with the PA, around 6:30 PM revealed the triage nurse went to get the patient. The patient did not answer when called.  The second triage staff arrived and called for the patient and the patient came back.  She did complain of some diarrhea the day before, she was afebrile; she had no neck pain whatsoever.  There was nothing abnormal about the patient; her only complaint was that her right arm hurt after drinking juice.  She walked into the triage area walking normally.  About 15 minutes later the registrar came and told me that this patient had vomited in the registration area I told her to talk to the charge nurse.  The charge nurse came to me 10 minutes later and asked me if I would take another look at her which I did.  Her ESP ' s (Emergency Screening Protocol) remained non- emergent.  She was in registration when she seen again in the presence of the charge nurse.  Still her only complaint was that her arm hurt.  We did not repeat the vital signs in triage or in the admissions area.  She did not have a fever.  I do not know who called the police.  The PA stated this is where I re-evaluated her.  During this interview the PA was observed on the side of the desk where the registrar was seated and the desk separated the PA from the patient.  He stated that the patient raised her arm and said that it still hurts.  The PA stated that he left to go back to the ER  and never saw the patient again.  Other than the NON-URGENT MSE DETERMINATION form the medical record did not document any information relating to the care the patient received or any events that occurred during the encounter at the registrar ' s desk or after the patient left the registrar desk.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was completed.  This includes ancillary services routinely available to emergency department to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed after patient #1 ' s presentation signs and symptoms had changed (change in mentation, weakness and Vital signs) while still on hospital property.  The hospital staff was well aware the change in patient #1 ' s medical condition status on 7/29/2014.


9. Interview with the day shift charge nurse on 08./8/2014 at 12:42 PM registration has a scripted guide for persons to be seen in the ER.  If the person still wants to be seen, the charge nurse reiterates what registration has told them.  If the patient cannot pay but wishes to be seen, the triage nurse would take them back to the triage area to be re-evaluated and speak to the ER  doctor.  The house supervisor should be notified if person insist on being seen or refuses to leave.
There was no documentation in the medical record to indicate that House supervisor was notified when it was determined that patient #1 needed to be re-evaluated. 

10.  Interview on 08/08/2014 at 1:08 PM with emergency room    physician on duty on 07/29/2014 revealed that with the emergency screening protocol (ESP) if PA does not think it is an emergency then the co-pay has to be paid. The patient makes the decision to be seen after speaking with the registrar if they have no insurance it is a $150.00 flat rate co-payment this includes any lab or x-rays.  Anytime the mid-level sees someone if they have a question as to whether or not the person needs to be seen in the ER  they will consult with the ER  doctor before making the determination.  The ER  physician reviews all of the mid-level staff charts.  Review of the medical revealed that .the ER  physician was consulted by the PA but did not examine or see the patient.  The hospital failed to ensure that their policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a MSE was provided for patient #1on 7/29/2014 regardless of the patient ' s ability to pay after her medical condition had changed while still on hospital property.


11. Interview with the security guard on 09/08/2014 at 3:45 p.m. stated that; I was making rounds in the facility and one of the girls called me to the registration area because they had a patient that had vomited.  I went to my office which is located off the registration area, I wear hearing aids so I having a hard time understanding her verbiage, but I was able to hear a lady that was with the patient (patient#1) say that they have examined her.  The lady was talking a little loud.  I did not hear the patient (patient#1) say anything.  I left the area to complete my rounds.  I was not contacted to come back to the triage area.  When I completed my rounds and came back into the ER  area the police were present talking to the patient.  I do not know who called the police.  The police encouraged the patient to get out of the wheelchair in the triage area and to get into the wheelchair so she could leave the facility. The last time I saw patient#1 she was sitting in the wheelchair outside with Paramedic (#1) and the other nurse.


12.  Interview with ER  paramedic #1 on 08/08/2014 at 3:49 PM revealed that this patient had already been through triage.  I was asked to come out to the registration area by the registration clerk to help get a patient out of a chair and into a wheelchair.  Paramedic #2 was requested and he came to assist me move the patient from the chair in the registration into a wheelchair.  She could not get out of the chair.  I went and got the PA to come to reevaluate the patient again because she was unable to get out of the chair into the wheelchair and she had thrown up while I was present.  The PA and charge nurse came to the registration area and saw the patient.  They stated that she was okay to leave.  I think the charge nurse called the police.  The police came and encouraged the patient to get out of the chair and into the wheelchair.  We did not have to manually lift her into the wheelchair.  She was able to get into the wheelchair with assistance.  The patient was sitting with her arm on the arm of the wheelchair and she had her head resting on her arm.  Paramedic #2 took her outside in the presence of the police.  I cleaned up the vomit and met Paramedic #2 outside.  Her family was getting a little confrontational verbally with me and Paramedic #2.  The patient was not saying or doing anything.  She did not say that she wanted to go anywhere else.  Myself and paramedic #2 had difficulty getting the patient from the wheelchair into the car we tried for over a half hour but were unable to get her from the wheelchair into the car.  The patient appeared to be very weak.  We called and informed the charge nurse of what was going on with the patient and that the family had asked the police to call Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to transfer the patient to another facility.  She did not give us any new direction, she just replied okay.  Paramedic #2 and I stayed outside with the patient until EMS arrived.  EMS had trouble getting the patient out of the wheelchair onto the stretcher.  She was lifted into a standing position and the stretcher was placed beneath the patient and she was slid onto the stretcher.  The patient left the facility via EMS and paramedic #2 and I came back into the facility.  again ,The ER  paramedic was asked if he received any guidance when he spoke to the charge nurse, again he stated that no guidance was given other than OK.

8.  AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TRIAGE PA ON 08/08/2014 AT 12:30 PM REVEALED THAT I WORK BOTH AS THE TRIAGE  PA AND THE ER  PA  TO HELP OUT IN THE BACK UNTIL THE SECOND PA COMES IN AT 12 NOON IF I AM NOT BUSY. I DETERMINE IF THE PERSON IS TO BE SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM    BY THE PHYSICIAN.  EVERY NON-EMERGENCY PATIENT IS DISCUSSED WITH THE PHYSICIAN EXCEPT FOR SUTURE REMOVALS. THE PATIENTS DO NOT DISCUSS IN TRIAGE IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE SEEN IN THE ER  OR NOT.  I MAKE THE DETERMINATION THEN THEY GO TO REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION GIVES THEM THE DETERMINATION THAT WAS MADE AND THEIR OPTIONS.  IF THE PERSON INSISTS ON BEING SEEN THE CHARGE NURSE IN THE ER  GETS INVOLVED.  CONTINUED INTERVIEW WITH THE PA, AROUND 6:30 PM REVEALED THE TRIAGE NURSE WENT TO GET THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT DID NOT ANSWER WHEN CALLED.  THE SECOND TRIAGE STAFF ARRIVED AND CALLED FOR THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT CAME BACK.  SHE DID COMPLAIN OF SOME DIARRHEA THE DAY BEFORE, SHE WAS AFEBRILE; SHE HAD NO NECK PAIN WHATSOEVER.  THERE WAS NOTHING ABNORMAL ABOUT THE PATIENT; HER ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT HER RIGHT ARM HURT AFTER DRINKING JUICE.  SHE WALKED INTO THE TRIAGE AREA WALKING NORMALLY.  ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER THE REGISTRAR CAME AND TOLD ME THAT THIS PATIENT HAD VOMITED IN THE REGISTRATION AREA I TOLD HER TO TALK TO THE CHARGE NURSE.  THE CHARGE NURSE CAME TO ME 10 MINUTES LATER AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT HER WHICH I DID.  HER ESP ' S (EMERGENCY SCREENING PROTOCOL) REMAINED NON- EMERGENT.  SHE WAS IN REGISTRATION WHEN SHE SEEN AGAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CHARGE NURSE.  STILL HER ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT HER ARM HURT.  WE DID NOT REPEAT THE VITAL SIGNS IN TRIAGE OR IN THE ADMISSIONS AREA.  SHE DID NOT HAVE A FEVER.  I DO NOT KNOW WHO CALLED THE POLICE.  THE PA STATED THIS IS WHERE I RE-EVALUATED HER.  DURING THIS INTERVIEW THE PA WAS OBSERVED ON THE SIDE OF THE DESK WHERE THE REGISTRAR WAS SEATED AND THE DESK SEPARATED THE PA FROM THE PATIENT.  HE STATED THAT THE PATIENT RAISED HER ARM AND SAID THAT IT STILL HURTS.  THE PA STATED THAT HE LEFT TO GO BACK TO THE ER  AND NEVER SAW THE PATIENT AGAIN.  OTHER THAN THE NON-URGENT MSE DETERMINATION FORM THE MEDICAL RECORD DID NOT DOCUMENT ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CARE THE PATIENT RECEIVED OR ANY EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE ENCOUNTER AT THE REGISTRAR ' S DESK OR AFTER THE PATIENT LEFT THE REGISTRAR DESK.  THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR POLICY AND PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED AS EVIDENCED BY FAILING TO ENSURE THAT AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION WAS COMPLETED.  THIS INCLUDES ANCILLARY SERVICES ROUTINELY AVAILABLE TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION EXISTED AFTER PATIENT #1 ' S PRESENTATION SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS HAD CHANGED (CHANGE IN MENTATION, WEAKNESS AND VITAL SIGNS) WHILE STILL ON HOSPITAL PROPERTY.  THE HOSPITAL STAFF WAS WELL AWARE THE CHANGE IN PATIENT #1 ' S MEDICAL CONDITION STATUS ON 7/29/2014.

IF THE PATIENT CANNOT PAY BUT WISHES TO BE SEEN, THE TRIAGE NURSE WOULD TAKE THEM BACK TO THE TRIAGE AREA TO BE RE-EVALUATED AND SPEAK TO THE ER  DOCTOR.  THE HOUSE SUPERVISOR SHOULD BE NOTIFIED IF PERSON INSIST ON BEING SEEN OR REFUSES TO LEAVE.
THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD TO INDICATE THAT HOUSE SUPERVISOR WAS NOTIFIED WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT PATIENT #1 NEEDED TO BE RE-EVALUATED. 

10.  INTERVIEW ON 08/08/2014 AT 1:08 PM WITH EMERGENCY ROOM    PHYSICIAN ON DUTY ON 07/29/2014 REVEALED THAT WITH THE EMERGENCY SCREENING PROTOCOL (ESP) IF PA DOES NOT THINK IT IS AN EMERGENCY THEN THE CO-PAY HAS TO BE PAID. THE PATIENT MAKES THE DECISION TO BE SEEN AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE REGISTRAR IF THEY HAVE NO INSURANCE IT IS A $150.00 FLAT RATE CO-PAYMENT THIS INCLUDES ANY LAB OR X-RAYS.  ANYTIME THE MID-LEVEL SEES SOMEONE IF THEY HAVE A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON NEEDS TO BE SEEN IN THE ER  THEY WILL CONSULT WITH THE ER  DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING THE DETERMINATION.  THE ER  PHYSICIAN REVIEWS ALL OF THE MID-LEVEL STAFF CHARTS.  REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL REVEALED THAT .THE ER  PHYSICIAN WAS CONSULTED BY THE PA BUT DID NOT EXAMINE OR SEE THE PATIENT.

I WAS ASKED TO COME OUT TO THE REGISTRATION AREA BY THE REGISTRATION CLERK TO HELP GET A PATIENT OUT OF A CHAIR AND INTO A WHEELCHAIR.  PARAMEDIC #2 WAS REQUESTED AND HE CAME TO ASSIST ME MOVE THE PATIENT FROM THE CHAIR IN THE REGISTRATION INTO A WHEELCHAIR.  SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE CHAIR.

THE PA AND CHARGE NURSE CAME TO THE REGISTRATION AREA AND SAW THE PATIENT.  THEY STATED THAT SHE WAS OKAY TO LEAVE.  I THINK THE CHARGE NURSE CALLED THE POLICE.  THE POLICE CAME AND ENCOURAGED THE PATIENT TO GET OUT OF THE CHAIR AND INTO THE WHEELCHAIR.  WE DID NOT HAVE TO MANUALLY LIFT HER INTO THE WHEELCHAIR.  SHE WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE WHEELCHAIR WITH ASSISTANCE.  THE PATIENT WAS SITTING WITH HER ARM ON THE ARM OF THE WHEELCHAIR AND SHE HAD HER HEAD RESTING ON HER ARM.

THE PATIENT APPEARED TO BE VERY WEAK.  WE CALLED AND INFORMED THE CHARGE NURSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE PATIENT AND THAT THE FAMILY HAD ASKED THE POLICE TO CALL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) TO TRANSFER THE PATIENT TO ANOTHER FACILITY.  SHE DID NOT GIVE US ANY NEW DIRECTION, SHE JUST REPLIED OKAY.  PARAMEDIC #2 AND I STAYED OUTSIDE WITH THE PATIENT UNTIL EMS ARRIVED.

Based on interview, record review and a review of facility documentation, the facility failed to ensure the performance of appropriate transfers through the completion of documentation in the medical record to indicate the reasons for the requests for transfer, as well as indications as to whether or not the patient is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer and the inclusion of physician-signed a certifications that, based upon the information available at the time of transfers, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweighed the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman in labor (#1), to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred in five of twenty sampled patients (#1, #7, #8, #13 & #18).

Findings:  


A review of policy ""Interfacility Transfer from a Health First Hospital to an Outside Facility"" revealed the following, ""Documentation forms:  Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to transfer.  ... Provide the patient and/or legal representation with information regarding the reason for transfer and the risks associated with the transfer.""  The second page of this document, as referenced in the policy, addresses reasons for the transfer, patient awareness of the risk and benefits of a transfer and a physician certification that the benefits of a transfer to another facility outweighs the risks.    

During an interview of the Emergency Department (ED) Manager on 9/03/20 at 11:50 AM, she stated that the process in the ED is for the Health Unit Coordinator (HUC) to print out blank transfer documentation, including the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form and bring it to the nurse for eventual completion, including physician's signature.  She then brings the completed documents back to the HUC.  

1. A review of the medical record of patient #1 was performed.  The patient was triaged on 7/27/20 at 5:35 PM.  A physician's note of 7/27/20 at 5:44 PM, which covers events through 6:01 PM on the same day, read, ""Progress and Procedures:  Course of care:  Helicopter transport unavailable due to bad weather. ... 911 called and is coming with lights and sirens to transport to L&D (labor and delivery) at HRMC (Holmes Regional Medical Center). ... Discussed case with on-call health care provider .... Agreed upon treatment plan.  Health care provider will see patient in hospital .... Disposition ...Transferred to another Health First facility.  Physician orders of 7/27/20 at 6:01 PM read, ""Discharge to other HF (Health First) facility.""  The record did not have the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form. 

On 9/02/20 at 3:32 PM, the ED physician for patient #1 stated that the patient was discharged    in a stable condition when discharged    and that she needed to go.  He stated that Viera Hospital does not have obstetric (OB) capabilities.  He stated that they always complete the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form but he could not recall specifics of this form with patient #1.  

On 9/02/20 at approximately 3:48 PM, registered nurse (RN) A stated that she remembered patient #1.   She could not recall any specifics regarding the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form.  She stated that the HUC prints the form out and that it was the primary nurse's responsibility to get it signed.  

On 9/02/20 at approximately 3:57 PM, RN B stated that she could not recall whether or not the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form was completed for patient #1.  

On 9/02/20 at approximately 2:55 PM, RN C stated that she remembered the patient.  She stated that she was not involved in assessing or caring for the patient.  She stated that she could not remember whether the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form was completed and placed in the record.  She stated that day, during the involved time period, she had to assume the HUC role because the assigned person was absent that day.  

2. A review of the medical record of patient #7 was performed.  The patient was triaged on 7/22/20 at 1:19 AM.  A physician note of 7/22/20 at 3:30 AM read, ""Reviewed CT (Computed Tomography) results, will transfer patient to HRMC as a trauma transfer.  Transfer Center called. ... Disposition:  Transferred to another Health First Facility.""  Orders for the transfer were placed at 3:31 AM on 7/22/20.  The record did not have the form ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer.

3.  A review of the medical record of patient #8 was performed.  The patient was triaged on 7/24/20 at 10:06 AM.  A physician's note of 7/24/20 at 10:56 AM read, ""Course of Care:  10:56.   .... Transfer to Holmes.  Physician orders of 7/24/20 at 11:04 AM read, ""Discharge to other HF facility.""  A physician's note of 7/24/20 at 11:06 AM read, ""Holmes will accept pt."" The record did not have the ""Patient Consent/Request/Refusal to Transfer"" form.

4. A review of the medical record of patient #13 was performed.  The patient was triaged on 7/26/20 at 12:59 PM.  A physician's note of 7/26/20 at 4:16 PM read, ""Dr. (prior shift physician) decided to transfer patient to facility with oral maxillofacial surgeon in for IV (intravenous) antibiotics.  I agree with this plan having assessed the patient myself. ... Disposition:  Transferred to Acute Hospital.""

Based on a review of  medical records, review of an obstetric outpatient record, review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations and Policy and Procedure review and staff interviews the facility failed to ensure that all individuals who presented to their emergency department were provided with an appropriate medical screening examination that was within the capability of the hospital's emergency department including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to determine whether or not  an emergency medical condition exists for one (1- #20) of twenty (20) patients medical records  reviewed.

Findings include:


1. Review of facility policy 2603, EMTALA.01.EMTALA, effective 2/26/2008, revised 5/2/2016, revealed that every individual who presented to the Emergency Department and requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, and every individual who is not a hospital patient who went elsewhere on hospital property (that is, the individual who went to the hospital but not to the dedicated Emergency Department), who either requests examination or treatment for a medical condition, or if a prudent layperson observer would believe that the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition (EMC), must at a minimum have an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to determine if an EMC does or does not exist, regardless of the individual's ability to pay.

2. Review of facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, approved 1/12/2015, revised: 12/16/2015, revealed:
6. All patients who present to the Emergency Department must be seen by a credentialed qualified medical provider. The patient may request his family physician or physician of choice but a medical screening examination to rule out an emergency medical condition and any necessary stabilizing treatment shall not be delayed while waiting for a requested physician to arrive. At no time will patients be discharged    from the Emergency Department without a provider evaluation.

3. Patient #20's medical record dated 6/30/2017 was reviewed. Documentation by the ED nurse revealed that Patient #20 (MDS) dated [DATE] at 5:12 PM, ambulatory and alone. The medical record also revealed the patient's insurance was listed as ""Self-Pay."" The patient's initial vital signs were: Temperature: 98.1 (oral); Heart rate 96; Blood Pressure: 142/75; and Oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Further review of the medical record revealed blood laboratory work and urine was collected for a pregnancy test, Urine microscopic and urine analysis were ordered. A CT of the abdomen without contrast was also ordered. The Emergency Department Note Draft, dated 6/30/2017 revealed in part, ""HPI (history of Present illness. Review of Systems)...Chief Complaint: Vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks. History of Present illness: The patient (#20) ...with bleeding every day for the past 3 weeks. She is on no hormonal medications.....she has a ParaGard IUD (intra uterine device). There has been bleeding every day that is similar in severity to her normal menses an is associated with some clots being passed. She is going through 6-7 pads  per day... She talked to a nurse at the gynecologist office today who directed her here."" Further review revealed the patients ""Discharge Disposition: Home  Condition: Fair. Departure: Clinical Impression: Vaginal Bleeding.""  There was no documentation in the medical record to indicate that Patient #20 received a vaginal examination on 6/30/2017. The facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was performed for Patient #20 on 6/30/2017.


4. Interview with the ER  Director on 7/18/2017 at 2:38 PM in the conference room confirmed that Patient #20 had not received an MSE (medical screening examination) 7/3/2017. The ER  Director explained that Patient #20 presented to the ER  registration desk mid-morning on 7/3/2017. The ER  Director stated further that the only person at the registration desk was the ER  technician, and that the ER  was not very busy during that time. The ER  Director stated that he/she became aware of the situation on 7/3/2017 at about 11:00 AM when he/she received a phone call from the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) asking if he/she was aware of Patient #20's situation. The CNO stated that he/she had received a phone call from the hospital's accrediting agency. The accrediting agency informed the CNO  that they had received a phone call from Patient #20, who stated that the ER  would not see her, and the CNO asked the ER  Director to look into it. The ER  Director stated that he/she phoned Patient #20, who explained that she was still bleeding, that she had tried to follow up with her OB-gyn MD that day, but that the office was closed due to the holiday.  Patient #20 also stated that she had spoken to the OB-gyn office's nurse, who had instructed her to return to the ER. Patient #20 further explained that when she arrived at the ER  to get her IUD out, the registrar/technician told her that the hospital's ER  doesn't remove IUDs, but they would be happy to see her.  After being given that information, Patient #20 stated that she left. The ER  Director stated that he/she told Patient #20 that he/she would contact the OB-gyn MD or nurse to learn where the hospital was in the process of getting her care, and call her back.  The ER  Director stated that he/she then left a voice mail for the OB-gyn MD, and had a mid-level provider send a text the MD with a message to contact him/her. The ER  Director further stated that after approximately twenty to thirty (20-30) minutes, he/she heard a lullaby over the intercom, which indicated that a baby had been born, and so went to the labor and delivery department to see if the on-call OB-gyn MD was there.  The ER  Director found OB-gyn MD #9 the labor and delivery department and explained the situation to concerning Patient  #20 to MD #9. The ER  Director further explained that the Women's Services manager was also present and that the three of them discussed the best course of action to get care for Patient #20.  The ER  Director, MD #9 and the Women's Services manager decided that the ER  Director would contact Patient #20, and have her return to the women's services area of the hospital, where MD #9 would remove the IUD as an outpatient procedure. The ER  Director further stated that he/she returned to his/her office and phoned Patient #20 a couple of times, was unable to leave a voice message,  therefore also sent Patient #20 a text. The facility failed to ensure that Patient #20 received and appropriate medical screening examination by a Qualified Medical Personnel (QMP) on 7/3/2017; instead the  Patient #20 was discouraged by emergency department staff from being evaluated by a QMP indicating the hospital was not capable of removing the IUD.

5. Patient #20 responded to the ER  Director's text with a message that she had just spoken to MD #9, and was returning to the hospital. The ER  Director stated that he/she then instructed Patient #20 to go to the ER  waiting room and that The ER  Director would escort Patient #20 upstairs. The ER  Director stated that he/she then went to the ER  registration desk, requesting that Patient # 20 be pre-registered so as to avoid a long wait. The ER  Director further explained that Patient # 20 arrived approximately thirty to sixty (30-60) minutes later. The ER  director met Patient #20 in the ER  to complete the registration process, then escorted Patient #20 to the labor and delivery (L&D) department, where the L&D nurse took over care of Patient #20.  The ER  Director stated that as he/she walked with Patient #20, the patient stated that she just wanted the IUD out, so the bleeding would stop, and she could return to work. Patient #20 also stated that she wondered if she was not seen because she did not have insurance, to which the ER  Director had assured her that the registrars at the front desk did not know patients' insurance status and that many patients seen did not have insurance, so it did not matter.

6. Interview with the ER  Charge Nurse on 7/18/2017 at 4:01 PM in the conference room revealed that he/she had worked as Charge Nurse for approximately ten (10) years, and received EMTALA training annually.  The Charge Nurse confirmed that he/she had been in the charge position on 7/3/2017 during the day shift when Patient #20 presented to the ER  for treatment. He/she stated that he/she was in the back working when the ER  technician telephoned him/her stating that Patient #20 was present and was requesting that her IUD be removed. The Charge Nurse stated that Patient #20 had been seen the preceding day or two, treated, and advised to see her OB-gyn physician for the IUD removal. The Charge Nurse stated that he/she asked the technician if Patient #20 had seen her OB-gyn physician or not, and the technician responded ""no"". The Charge Nurse explained that he/she had instructed the technician to tell Patient #20 it was unlikely that the IUD would be removed in the ER, but that they would be happy to see her if she wished to sign in. The Charge Nurse further stated that the technician had told him/her that Patient #20 had left after the conversation, and had not signed in at that point. The Charge Nurse stated that he/she was just trying to be honest with Patient #20 because Patient #20 wouldn't want to sit back there for four or five (4 or 5) hours, then find out that the ER  would not be able to give her the treatment she wanted.

7. Interview with the ER  technician on 7/18/2017 at 4:26 PM in the conference room revealed that he/she had worked in his/her current position on day shift for approximately twelve (12) years, and had been trained in EMTALA. The ER  technician stated that Patient #20 arrived in the ER  stating that an OB-gyn physician had instructed her to meet him at his office, but when she arrived, the office was closed. Patient #20 was upset and enquired whether that physician was on-call or not. The ER  technician stated that he/she had informed Patient #20 that the physician was not on-call, but another physician one was covering. The ER  technician explained that he/she had asked Patient #20 what was going on, and Patient #20 stated that she thought her IUD was out of place, and she wanted to have it removed. The ER  technician stated that he/she informed Patient #20 that the ER  didn't normally remove IUDs there, but she was more than welcome to sign in and see the ER  MD. The technician could not recall if he/she had consulted with the Charge Nurse, or not. The technician stated that Patient #20 then asked if she could have a copy of her X-ray procedure, and the technician had instructed that she could go down the hall to the radiology department to request a copy from them. The technician stated that he/she again asked Patient #20 if she wanted to see the ER  MD, and Patient #20 said ""no"", that she would find someone else with whom to follow up. Patient #20 then walked in the direction of the radiology department, and the next time the technician saw Patient #20, she was with the ER  Director. The technician confirmed that Patient #20 had never signed in.



8. Review of MD #9's documentation on Patient #20 from an obstetric outpatient record dated 7/3/2017 at 4:32 PM, revealed that Patient #20 had experienced vaginal bleeding for three (3) weeks, and was changing pads every two (2) hours. Patient #20 reported that she had called the OB-gyn office, and was told to go to ER  where MD #9 would be contacted for consultation. Patient #20 had not been seen by the on-call OB-gyn physician on Friday (6/30/17). Patient #20 stated that she had called the office again on 7/3/2017 in the morning, and was instructed to go to the ER. Patient #20 explained that on arrival at the ER, staff told her nothing could be done for her at that time. The ER  Supervisor informed of the situation and after reviewing the CT (computed tomography) and laboratory results for Patient #20 MD #9 phoned Patient #20, instructing her to return to the hospital for an examination and IUD (intrauterine device) removal. Patient #20 returned to the hospital on [DATE] at 1:41 PM. Vital signs at 3:20 PM were: Temperature-98.5, heart rate-85, respirations-18, and blood pressure-139/78. 
Ordered labs included: CBC (complete blood count), chemistry, blood type and screen, and urine culture. Results of CBC included: hemoglobin 7.9, hematocrit 26.
A procedure was performed to remove the IUD (contraceptive device) from the uterus, cervix. A culture was obtained on the IUD.
Patient #20 received an iron injection, Levaquin, and Flagyl (antibiotics).
Patient #20 tolerated the procedure well and was discharged    to home in stable condition on 7/3/17 at 5:41 PM with diagnoses of anemia, IUD removal, malpositioned IUD, pelvic pain, and vaginal bleeding. Instructions were provided on dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and follow up with MD #9 in two (2) weeks. Patient #20 also received prescriptions for antibiotics.

THE CHARGE NURSE STATED THAT PATIENT #20 HAD BEEN SEEN THE PRECEDING DAY OR TWO, TREATED, AND ADVISED TO SEE HER OB-GYN PHYSICIAN FOR THE IUD REMOVAL. THE CHARGE NURSE STATED THAT HE/SHE ASKED THE TECHNICIAN IF PATIENT #20 HAD SEEN HER OB-GYN PHYSICIAN OR NOT, AND THE TECHNICIAN RESPONDED ""NO"". THE CHARGE NURSE EXPLAINED THAT HE/SHE HAD INSTRUCTED THE TECHNICIAN TO TELL PATIENT #20 IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE IUD WOULD BE REMOVED IN THE ER, BUT THAT THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HER IF SHE WISHED TO SIGN IN. THE CHARGE NURSE FURTHER STATED THAT THE TECHNICIAN HAD TOLD HIM/HER THAT PATIENT #20 HAD LEFT AFTER THE CONVERSATION, AND HAD NOT SIGNED IN AT THAT POINT. THE CHARGE NURSE STATED THAT HE/SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST WITH PATIENT #20 BECAUSE PATIENT #20 WOULDN'T WANT TO SIT BACK THERE FOR FOUR OR FIVE (4 OR 5) HOURS, THEN FIND OUT THAT THE ER  WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE HER THE TREATMENT SHE WANTED.

7. INTERVIEW WITH THE ER  TECHNICIAN ON 7/18/2017 AT 4:26 PM IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM REVEALED THAT HE/SHE HAD WORKED IN HIS/HER CURRENT POSITION ON DAY SHIFT FOR APPROXIMATELY TWELVE (12) YEARS, AND HAD BEEN TRAINED IN EMTALA. THE ER  TECHNICIAN STATED THAT PATIENT #20 ARRIVED IN THE ER  STATING THAT AN OB-GYN PHYSICIAN HAD INSTRUCTED HER TO MEET HIM AT HIS OFFICE, BUT WHEN SHE ARRIVED, THE OFFICE WAS CLOSED. PATIENT #20 WAS UPSET AND ENQUIRED WHETHER THAT PHYSICIAN WAS ON-CALL OR NOT. THE ER  TECHNICIAN STATED THAT HE/SHE HAD INFORMED PATIENT #20 THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS NOT ON-CALL, BUT ANOTHER PHYSICIAN ONE WAS COVERING. THE ER  TECHNICIAN EXPLAINED THAT HE/SHE HAD ASKED PATIENT #20 WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND PATIENT #20 STATED THAT SHE THOUGHT HER IUD WAS OUT OF PLACE, AND SHE WANTED TO HAVE IT REMOVED. THE ER  TECHNICIAN STATED THAT HE/SHE INFORMED PATIENT #20 THAT THE ER  DIDN'T NORMALLY REMOVE IUDS THERE, BUT SHE WAS MORE THAN WELCOME TO SIGN IN AND SEE THE ER  MD. THE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT RECALL IF HE/SHE HAD CONSULTED WITH THE CHARGE NURSE, OR NOT. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT PATIENT #20 THEN ASKED IF SHE COULD HAVE A COPY OF HER X-RAY PROCEDURE, AND THE TECHNICIAN HAD INSTRUCTED THAT SHE COULD GO DOWN THE HALL TO THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT TO REQUEST A COPY FROM THEM. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT HE/SHE AGAIN ASKED PATIENT #20 IF SHE WANTED TO SEE THE ER  MD, AND PATIENT #20 SAID ""NO"", THAT SHE WOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE WITH WHOM TO FOLLOW UP. PATIENT #20 THEN WALKED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, AND THE NEXT TIME THE TECHNICIAN SAW PATIENT #20, SHE WAS WITH THE ER  DIRECTOR. THE TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THAT PATIENT #20 HAD NEVER SIGNED IN.



8. REVIEW OF MD #9'S DOCUMENTATION ON PATIENT #20 FROM AN OBSTETRIC OUTPATIENT RECORD DATED 7/3/2017 AT 4:32 PM, REVEALED THAT PATIENT #20 HAD EXPERIENCED VAGINAL BLEEDING FOR THREE (3) WEEKS, AND WAS CHANGING PADS EVERY TWO (2) HOURS. PATIENT #20 REPORTED THAT SHE HAD CALLED THE OB-GYN OFFICE, AND WAS TOLD TO GO TO ER  WHERE MD #9 WOULD BE CONTACTED FOR CONSULTATION. PATIENT #20 HAD NOT BEEN SEEN BY THE ON-CALL OB-GYN PHYSICIAN ON FRIDAY (6/30/17). PATIENT #20 STATED THAT SHE HAD CALLED THE OFFICE AGAIN ON 7/3/2017 IN THE MORNING, AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO TO THE ER. PATIENT #20 EXPLAINED THAT ON ARRIVAL AT THE ER, STAFF TOLD HER NOTHING COULD BE DONE FOR HER AT THAT TIME. THE ER  SUPERVISOR INFORMED OF THE SITUATION AND AFTER REVIEWING THE CT (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY) AND LABORATORY RESULTS FOR PATIENT #20 MD #9 PHONED PATIENT #20, INSTRUCTING HER TO RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR AN EXAMINATION AND IUD (INTRAUTERINE DEVICE) REMOVAL. PATIENT #20 RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL ON [DATE] AT 1:41 PM. VITAL SIGNS AT 3:20 PM WERE: TEMPERATURE-98.5, HEART RATE-85, RESPIRATIONS-18, AND BLOOD PRESSURE-139/78.

Based on observational tours, review of medical records, ambulance trip report review,  facility Policy and Procedure review, Emergency Department Log review, facility timeline of events review, credentialing file review, staffing schedules review, e-mail communications review, annual competency training reviews, and staff interviews, it was determined the facility failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination, within the capability of the hospital's emergency department  was provided by a qualified medical provider and failed to ensure continued monitoring of an individual's needs, after an abnormal oxygen saturation level and lethal cardiac arrhythmias from the cardiac monitor were identified by staff for 1 (#1) of 20 sampled medical records reviewed. 

Findings were:

1.    Observational Tour
An observational tour of the Emergency Department (ED) and Labor and Delivery Department was conducted on 9/24/18 at 11:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon accompanied by the Accreditation Coordinator and Employee #1.  Observed EMTALA signage displayed prominently in all patient access areas.  Observation of the ED monitoring station revealed an alarm tech monitoring two (2) screens.  A total of twelve (12) patients were observed to be monitored on the alarm screens.  The tech was actively calling nurses regarding various patient's statuses.   

2.    EMS Ambulance Report
The EMS ambulance trip report dated 9/14/2018 was reviewed. The report revealed in part, ""Vital signs: 1546 B/P (Blood Pressure) 138/92; P (pulse) 82; Respirations: 16; Pulse Ox: 92%; Blood Glucose: 106 ...Pain Level: 10... Narrative ...MED2 responded immediately to (Patient #5) complaining of weakness and diarrhea ...the patient is awake, alert and oriented to person, place, time and event. The patient stated that she has been having diarrhea for a few months now and the Doctor hasn't been able to determine the cause but in the last two days it has gotten worse and now is unable to stand and walk. The patient states she has been having uncontrollable diarrhea since yesterday evening ...The patient was asked what hospital she would like to go to for further evaluation and the patient advised EMS to go to Phoebe Main ...the patient and her vitals were monitored en-route to Phoebe Main. Upon arrival. The patient was placed in a room, and report was given to ...RN."" 

3. Central Log Review
A review of the facility's central log revealed that Patient #1 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) via ambulance on 09/14/18 at 4:20 p.m.  

4.    Medical Record Review Patient #1
Review of Patient #1's medical record revealed that he/she arrived at the facility via ambulance with complaints of weakness and persistent diarrhea.  A nursing assessment at 4:29 p.m. revealed that Patient #1 was awake, responsive, and oriented, had no difficulty breathing, reported no pain, and his/her skin was warm with normal color.   The nurse assigned an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level (level assigned to indicate how critical a patient is) of three (3) to Patient #1.   At 4:29 p.m., Patient #1's vital signs were as follows:
Temperature 98.1 degrees (normal range 97.7-99.5 °F), 
Heart rate - 78 beats per minute (normal range 60 to 100 beats per minute), Respirations- 20 breaths per minute (normal range 14 to 20 breaths per minute), blood pressure- 138/90 (normal 120/80), oxygen saturation- 99% (normal range is 95-100%).   
Further review of Patient #1's record revealed that Patient #1 had blood drawn for laboratory tests and had an intravenous (IV) line placed in his/her left arm at 4:47 p.m.  At 4:50 p.m., Patient #1's vital signs were as follows:
Heart rate - 76 beats per minute, 
Respirations- 20 breaths per minute, and
Oxygen saturation- 97%.  Patient #1 was on a continuous cardiac monitor (a monitor that continuously records heart rate, respiration, and oxygen saturation). Review of the patient care notes revealed that the respiratory therapist (Employee #2) responded to Patient #1's room at 5:34 p.m. in response to a family member calling for help.  Employee #2 found Patient #1 unresponsive, pulseless and initiated a code blue.  Review of the code blue documentation revealed that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started at 5:35 p.m. At 5:37 p.m., the patient was in asystole ('flat line', no cardiac activity) and received a dose of epinephrine (a medication used to increase the heart rate) via intravenous (IV) line (a small plastic tube inserted in the vein to give medicine and IV fluids).   The documentation revealed that at 5:39 p.m. Patient #1 remained in asystole.  At 5:40 p.m., Patient #1 was given a dose of epinephrine via IV.  Patient #1 remained in asystole and at 5:43 p.m. he/she was given another dose of epinephrine.  Patient #1 remained in asystole and was given epinephrine at 5:46 p.m. and 5:49 p.m.  At 5:50 Patient #1 's cardiac rhythm showed ventricular fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) and received defibrillation (an electrical shock to help the heart start).  At 5:52 p.m. Patient #1's cardiac rhythm was asystole.  Resuscitation efforts were stopped at 5:52 p.m.  
Review of the physician's (Credential #5) note revealed that he/she was called to Patient #1's room at 5:35 p.m. and found Patient #1 unresponsive, apneic (not breathing) and without a pulse.  CPR was in progress, and a breathing tube was inserted.  A bedside ultrasound was used and determined that there was no cardiac activity present.  Patient #1's time of death was 5:52 p.m.  

5.    Facility Timeline of Events
A review of the timeline of events provided by the facility revealed as follows:
4:20 p.m.- Patient #1 arrived at the facility via EMS and was placed in a room immediately.
4:29 p.m.- Patient #1 was triaged by RN#3, Patient #1's primary nurse.  Patient #1's chief complaint was diarrhea for six (6) months, worse over the past two (2) days.  Patient #1's triage vital signs were stable, and Patient #1 was noted to be awake, alert and talking. 
4:35 p.m.- Patient #1 was placed on a cardiac monitor.
4:36 p.m.- RN #3 inserted an IV and drew blood for laboratory tests. 
4:50 p.m.- The cardiac monitor showed that Patient #1 had an oxygen saturation of 64%.  The record revealed that no one responded to Patient #1's room at that time.
4:53 p.m.- The monitor alarm was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station.
4:54 p.m.- The monitor showed that Patient #1 was in [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] (abnormally rapid heart rate) for three (3) seconds.
4:54 p.m.- The monitor alarm was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station three (3) consecutive times. 
4:55 p.m.- The monitor showed that Patient #1 was in [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and alarmed with a red alarm.  The monitor technician notified Patient #1's primary nurse.  The primary nurse reported that Patient #1 was 'okay and moving' and that he/she would check on him/her 'in a minute'. 
4:55 p.m.- The monitor was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station three (3) consecutive times.  
4:56 p.m.- The monitor showed that the patient was in [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] from 4:55 p.m. through 5:00 p.m.
5:00 p.m.- [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and ventricular fibrillation (erratic and disorganized heart rhythm - emergency requires immediate attention) were noted on Patient #1's monitor.  Patient #1's oxygen saturation was 69%.
5:01 p.m.- The monitor showed that Patient #1's rhythm changed from ventricular fibrillation to asystole.  The alarm was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station. 
5:02 p.m. to 5:04 p.m.- The apnea alarm was noted on the monitor.
5:04 p.m.- The alarm was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station.
5:06 p.m.- The monitor showed ventricular fibrillation and changed to asystole.  The alarm was silenced at the Central Monitoring Station.
5:07 p.m. to 5:32 p.m.- The monitor showed asystole.  The alarm was silenced from the Central Monitoring Station nine (9) times. 
5:32 p.m.- Patient #1 was found by a family member.  A code blue was called, and the monitor was placed in 'standby' mode from Patient #1's room.  CPR and ACLS protocol were started and Patient #1 expired at 5:52 p.m. on 09/14/18. The facility failed to follow their policies and procedures as evidenced by: -
Patient #1 manifested a medical condition of acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]
The cardiac monitor revealed multiple life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, (an emergency medical condition);
Patient #1's oxygen saturation level dropped to 64% (normal range 95%-100%);
Patient #1 required immediate attention for her impairment of bodily functions once the abnormal vital signs and lethal cardiac functions were known. 

Despite the tech notifying the RN of abnormal cardiac arrhythmias and the drop in the patient's oxygen saturation, Patient #1 did not receive a visual re-assessment by the RN as stated in the facility's policy. Additionally, the RN failed to manually confirm the abnormal vital signs provided by the automated monitoring equipment as stated in the facility's policy and procedure. The tech also failed to communicate/escalate to the Charge Nurse and/or the physician immediately of abnormal vital signs and lethal cardiac arrhythmias, after the nurse failed to reassess the patient on the critical findings that were displayed on the monitor. Patient #1 expired on [DATE] at 5:52 p.m. 


6.    Interviews
During an interview with the emergency room    (ED) Manager (RN #1) on 09/24/18 at 11:55 a.m. in the ED, the ED Manager explained that ED Technicians (techs) were all trained to monitor the alarms in the ED.  He/she stated that none of the techs were qualified to interpret rhythms but were trained to distinguish between types of alarms that were triggered. The ED Manager stated that one tech was responsible for monitoring all the alarms and that the charge nurse was responsible for making the assignment.  The ED Manager further stated that the alarms are monitored twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  The Manager explained that a red alarm indicated any fatal, or potentially fatal, vital signs or arrhythmias. If a red alarm triggered, the tech was responsible for notifying the nurse by radio communication of the alarm and what had happened to trigger the alarm.  The nurse had sixty (60) seconds to respond to the communication. If the alarm is not taken care of within sixty (60) seconds, the tech is supposed to notify the ED Charge Nurse.  All nurses are expected to respond to an alarm, whether the patient is theirs or not.  The ED Manager added that all nurses are expected to respond to any alarms in their patient's room.  The ED alarm monitor is there as a back-up in case the nurse is caring for another patient in another room and can't hear or respond immediately to the alarm.  The ED Manager stated that the ED monitor techs are covered during their meal and breaks.
During a follow-up interview with the ED Manager (RN #1) on 09/24/18 at 4:20 p.m. in the Conference Room, the ED Manager acknowledged that the facility's ED alarm policy was not followed by the RN #3 and the tech (Employee #4).  The ED Manager added that RN #3 should have gone to Patient #1's room and assessed Patient #1 after the tech notified RN #3 that the patient's red alarm had triggered.  The ED Manager added that the tech did not follow the alarm policy by notifying the Charge Nurse after sixty (60) seconds when the RN did not respond to Patient #1's room.  ED Manager indicated that he/she was working the 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift on 09/14/18 and was present in the alarm monitoring station when the code was called for Patient #1.  ED Manager revealed that he/she saw on the monitor that the alarm had been silenced in Patient #1's room.  He/she elaborated that when the alarm was silenced at the monitoring station, this also silenced the alarm at Patient #1's bedside.   The ED Manager stated that he/she spoke with both RN #3 and Employee #4 after the code and learned that Employee #4 had communicated to RN #3 multiple times that Patient#1's red alarm had triggered.  Employee #4 had reported to the ED Manager that RN #3 stated that RN #3 had just been in Patient #1's room, and that Patient #1 ""was fine"", and that RN #3 would take care of Patient #1 ""shortly"".  The ED Manager stated that Employee #4 confirmed that Employee #4 did not call the charge nurse to report the red alarm per the facility's ED protocol.  The ED Manager stated that RN #3 and Employee #4 were sent home and suspended immediately and subsequently terminated on 09/19/18 as a result of the incident.  The ED Manager stated that the facility became aware of Patient #1's decline in status when Patient #1's family entered Patient #1's room and found Patient #1's unresponsive. The ED Manager indicated that Patient #1's family immediately sought help for Patient #1, and a code blue was called. The ED Manager stated that it appeared that Patient #1 was down for possibly thirty (30) minutes before CPR was initiated.  The ED Manager stated that he/she notified the monitor vendor the next day, and the settings that allowed the techs to silence the alarms from a remote location was disabled.  The ED Manager stated that the alarm could only be silenced from the bedside and as part of the new ED practice, the alarm can only be silenced by licensed clinical staff.  The ED Manager stated that the ED staff was made aware of the policy changes regarding the alarm settings, and the staff was re-educated about responding to the alarms and patient condition escalation status.  

During a telephone interview with the Respiratory Therapist (Employee #2) on 09/25/18 at 8:47 a.m., Employee #2 stated that he/she worked the 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift on 09/14/18.  Employee #2 recalled Patient #1 due to the circumstances related to Employee # 's involvement in Patient #1's care on 09/14/18.  Employee #2 explained that he/she was in another patient's room that was directly across from Patient #1's room when he/she heard someone calling out for help.  Employee #2 ran out of the room and into the hallway and saw someone yelling outside of Patient #1's room that Patient #1 was in distress.  Employee #2 recalled that upon entry into Patient #1's room, Patient #1's face and hands were blue, and Patient #1 was unresponsive and pulseless.  Employee #2 called a code and began Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on Patient #1. Employee #2 stayed and assisted with CPR for approximately ten (10) minutes until Patient #1 was pronounced expired by the ED Medical Doctor (MD).  Employee #2 stated that he/she believed that CPR was performed for only a short period because it appeared that Patient #1 had been expired for an extended period of time.  Employee #2 stated that his/her understanding of the alarm system was limited. Employee #2 stated that the ED techs are all trained to notify the nursing staff by radio if a patient's alarm goes off.  Employee #2 revealed that he/she was not knowledgeable about the differences between a red or yellow alarm, or what different alarms represented concerning patient status.

During an interview with the ED Medical Doctor (MD #5) on 09/25/18 at 9:36 a.m. in the Conference Room, MD #5 stated that he/she was working on 09/14/18 and remembered Patient #1.  MD #5 stated that Patient #1 had not yet been assigned to a practitioner, but the patient had been assigned a bed, and labs were drawn per the ED protocol for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  MD #5 stated that the results of the laboratory tests been received at the time of Patient #1's decline in status.  MD #5 explained that Patient #1's vital signs were stable on admission to the ED and added that if a patient came in with unstable vitals, or in apparent distress, the patient is seen immediately by a practitioner.  MD #5 stated that it is not unusual for a nurse to report that a patient's condition had changed, and a practitioner would respond directly to the patient's bedside.  MD #5 stated that all of the necessary tests had been ordered for Patient #1 to help determine what was going on with the patient clinically.  MD #5 recalled being made aware that a code blue was called for Patient #1, and MD #5 responded Patient #1's bedside immediately.  On assessment, Patient #1 was pale and without pulse or respirations.  CPR was in progress.  MD #5 could not ascertain how long Patient#1 had been without pulse or respirations.  MD #5 further stated that the code ran for approximately seventeen (17) minutes.  A cardiac ultrasound was utilized at the bedside to confirm that there was no cardiac activity.  MD #5 stated that it would not have been clinically indicated to continue with CPR based on the patient's clinical status.

During an interview with the ED Charge Nurse (RN #6) on 09/25/18 at 2:51 p.m. in the Conference Room, RN #6 stated that RN #6 was working the 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift on 09/14/18. RN #6 recalled that he/she was at the alarm station speaking with the tech (Employee #4) when another tech approached RN #6 and stated that Patient #1 was actively coding. RN #6 stated that he/she did not hear any active alarms while RN #6 was at the alarm station.  RN #6 explained that when a red alarm is triggered, it makes a distinct, high-pitched sound, and RN #6 would have heard the alarm unless the alarm was silenced.  RN #6 went to Patient#1's room and observed that Patient#1 was receiving CPR. RN #6 stated that part of his/her responsibilities was to make the clinical assignments in the ED.  RN #6 stated that he/she assigned the tech (Employee #4) to the ED alarm station.  RN #6 added that it was her practice to rotate the alarm assignment every four (4) hours.  RN #6 stated that she expected that the nurses answer all red alarm notifications immediately and within sixty (60) seconds.  RN #6 stated that if the primary nurse is unable to respond to a red alarm, the RN is expected to ask another nurse to respond or to contact the charge nurse.   RN #6 stated that she expected the techs to notify the charge nurse if the primary nurse had not answered a red alarm notification within sixty (60) seconds.


7.    Policy and Procedures
A review of the facility policy, entity PPMH, ""EMTALA"", last reviewed 03/13/17, revealed that the Medical Screening Examination (""MSE"") is the process required to reach with reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether or not an Emergency Medical Condition existed, or a woman is in labor. Screening is to be conducted to the extent necessary, by physicians and/or other Qualified Medical Person or Personnel (QMP) to determine whether an Emergency Medical Condition exists. With respect to an individual with psychiatric symptoms, an MSE consists of both a medical and psychiatric screening.  
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (""EMTALA"") refers to Sections 1866 and
1867 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1395dd, which obligate hospitals to provide medical screening, treatment and transfer of individuals with Emergency Medical Conditions or women in labor.
It is also referred to as the ""anti-dumping"" statute. As a not-for-profit community hospital, PPMH provides treatment to patients regardless of their ability to pay, and therefore its core mission as well aligned with its EMTALA obligations.
(1) the term ""emergency medical condition"" means-
    (A) a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]
          severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be
          expected to result in-
        (i)  placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health
              of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,
        (ii)  serious impairment to bodily functions, or
        (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or
    (B)  with respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions-
        (i)   that there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or
        (ii)  that transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child.
Continued review of the policy revealed that ""stabilize"" means, with respect to an Emergency Medical Condition to either provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of an individual from a facility or, in the case of a woman in labor, that the woman has delivered the child and the placenta. Exception applicable to inpatients: If a hospital has screened an individual and found that the individual has an Emergency Medical Condition and admits that individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the Emergency Medical Condition, the hospital has satisfied its special responsibilities with respect to that individual under EMTALA.  Stabilized with respect to an Emergency Medical Condition means that no material deterioration of the condition is likely within reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from the facility or in the case of a woman in labor, that the woman delivered the child and the placenta.
A review of the facility policy, entity PPMH, ""Emergency Center Assessment and Reassessment"", last reviewed 01/01/17, revealed that assessment involves a brief, rapid assessment to identify actual or potential, life-threatening illness or injury related to: 
Airway
Breathing
Circulation
Disability - GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) AVPU (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive)
A secondary survey involves a more focused and detailed evaluation of the patient to identify other, less severe, non-life-threatening, illness or injury.  After the ABCD's have been addressed, the following should be obtained:
Vital signs:  a complete set of vital signs, when clinically indicated, including pulse oximetry, orthostatic and pain scale, should be obtained.
Head-to-toe assessment of body systems, when clinically indicated.  The assessment may be focused on only the area of the complaint, or the entire body.
Cardiac rhythm:  When clinically indicated (i.e.: chest pain, arrhythmia), an EKG should be obtained and monitor strip mounted on the nurse's notes as a baseline and whatever significant changes in rate, rhythm or ectopy occur.
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):  should be obtained on all patients when clinically indicated (i.e.: head trauma, altered mental status).  All trauma patients require an admission GCS.
Last menstrual period:  should be obtained on all female patients of childbearing age, when clinically indicated (i.e.: abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding).
Immunization history (specifically last tetanus) should be obtained on all patients, when clinically indicated (i.e.: laceration, all trauma patients).
Weight: should be obtained on all pediatric patients and any patients requiring medications with weight-based dosing (i.e.: [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] immunizations, heparin).  Weight should be actual (by scale), not estimated/stated weight.
Head circumference:  should be obtained on children < 12 months when clinically indicated (i.e.: [DIAGNOSES REDACTED], failure to thrive).
Visual acuity:  should be obtained when clinically indicated.
Past medical and surgical history:  any significant medical or surgical history should be ascertained and documented in the chart.
Current medications:  A complete list of the patient's medications, including over the counter and herbal/natural remedies should be documented in the chart.
Allergies:  A complete list of the patient's allergies should be listed in the chart.
A further review revealed that the frequency of reassessment is a guideline based on the patient's ESI score.
ESI Level 1 = No less than every hour for four (4) hours, then every two (2) hours.
ESI Level 2 = No less than every hour for two (2) hours, then every two (2) hours.
ESI Level 3 = No less than every two (2) hours for four (4) hours, then every four (4) hours.
ESI Level 4 & 5 = every four (4) hours, or as directed by the physician.
Abnormal vital signs provided by automated equipment will be confirmed manually.  Abnormal vital signs resulted will be communicated to the physician/provider immediately and documented in the patient's medical record.  
Vital signs are defined as obtaining the blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, temperature, pulse oximeter, pain and mental status as appropriate.
The frequency of the reassessment is based on the patient's acuity, condition, history, and complaint, or as directed by the physician and nurse/or nurse.
Vital sign results will be communicated to the primary nurse/designee and documented in the patient record.
A continued review revealed that a focused assessment related to the chief complaint shall be accomplished with every change of primary caregiver; e.g. change of shift or as clinically indicated.  Any deterioration in condition will be reported to the physician.
A review of the facility's alarm parameters in the ED revealed:
The monitor indicated a red alarm with:
Heart rate greater than one hundred forty-five (145) beats per minute or lower than thirty-five (35) beats per minute.
 Arrhythmia- asystole, ventricular fibrillation, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] for sustained for greater than four (4)     seconds.  [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] with a heart rate greater than one hundred (100) beats per minute.    a [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] runs greater than five (5) seconds.  Supra[DIAGNOSES REDACTED] with a heart rate greater than one hundred eighty (180) beats per minute.
    Oxygen saturation- pulse oximetry lower than eighty (80) percent.
    Respirations- apnea longer than twenty (20) seconds.
The monitor indicated a yellow alarm for:
    Heart rate greater than one hundred twenty-five (125) beats per minute and lower than fifty (50) beats per minute.
    Oxygen saturations- pulse oximetry lower than ninety (90) percent.
    Blood pressure- systolic blood pressure greater than one hundred eighty (180) mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than ninety (90) mmHg. 
    Respirations- respiratory rate greater than thirty (30) breaths per minute or less than eight (8) breaths per minute.
A review of the facility policy, entity PPMH, ""Triage Guidelines"", last reviewed 08/24/16 revealed that the purpose of the policy was to provide a standardized system whereby patients presenting to the Emergency Center are treated in order of priority based upon acuity utilizing the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Five-Level triage system.  These guidelines are to standardize care and are not rules from which deviation may not occur or be appropriate.
Definitions in the policy included:
1.    Triage:  The process by which the initial management of patients was identified, and the priorities of care were assigned. 
2.    Immediate Bedding: The process by which a patient was sent to an open, available bed based on their clinical need.
3.    Quick Registration: The process by which a patient's demographic information was entered into the hospital information system.
The policy was: 
A.    To provide a system to assist staff in expediting patient flow.
B.    To ensure that all patients are seen in a timely and efficient manner based on the degree of acuity and resources required for the disposition of the presenting problem. 
C.    To provide a system for the reassessment of all patients that cannot be seen immediately in the Emergency Center (EC) for changes in their condition.
Further review of the policy revealed that all patients had an initial age-appropriate Triage assessment performed by a Registered Nurse (RN) to determine the acuity of the patient and to decide the appropriate treatment area for medical screening and/or treatment. All patients entering the EC were to have their complaint assessed by a Registered Nurse and categorized as Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  The assigning of the ESI Level will be based on patient acuity and the number of resources required for disposition (admit/discharge/transfer).  Patients whose condition interfered with vital physiological functions and required immediate medical attention were brought immediately to the treatment area.  Patients who arrived by EMS ambulance were taken to the appropriate treatment area based on the initial triage.
Further review of the policy revealed the following exceptions to the policy: 
Patients with a Behavioral Health Emergency
    i.    Patients that are clinically stable and required behavioral health/psychiatric evaluation were immediately placed in a quiet area, preferably the EC Behavioral Health area.
Patients who had been the victim of a Sexual Assault
    ii.    Alleged sexual assault victims were taken directly to a private exam room where age-appropriate assessments were completed by a nurse.
Patients who were pregnant
    iii.    All stable patients presenting to the EC with any problem of an obstetric nature and who are 20 weeks or more gestation was transported to Labor and Delivery for evaluation.  
    iv.    If an OB patient 20 weeks or more presents to the EC with an Emergency problem and other signs and symptoms indicative of an acute illness or complaints associated with underlying medical conditions and/or trauma were to be stabilized in the EC and subsequently transferred to the Labor and Delivery for OB evaluation.
    v.    OB patients who are less than 20 weeks 'gestation were seen in the EC for any complaint.  An OB consultation will be obtained as needed.    

8.    Staffing Schedules
A review of the staffing of the ED from 7/1/18 through 9/21/18 revealed that staffing was adequate and in following with facility policy. A review of provider schedules from 7/1/18 through 9/21/18 revealed adequate coverage. 

9. Credentialing/Staff File Review. 
A review of two (2) credential files (#5, and 9) revealed both files contained current state licensure and delineation of privileges.  All files included evidence of current EMTALA training.
A review of seven (7) employee files (#1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8) revealed all seven (7) files contained current state licensure and facility required orientation and competency testing.  All seven (7) files contained evidence of current EMTALA training.  

10.    Facility Annual Compliance Training
A review of the facility's annual compliance training revealed that a review of EMTALA policies was performed. 
A review of the ED department-specific annual competencies revealed that the topic of bedside monitors was included in the topics covered. 

11.    E-mail communications
Review of email communication dated 9/25/18 at 9:03 a.m. from Employee #1 to all Emergency Center staff revealed that staff members would not be allowed to work until they had reviewed and received information on the escalation guidelines.  A member of the leadership would be present at shift huddles to present the information and have staff sign a roster.  Attachments to the email included: 
1. Alarm Monitor Processes revealed:
In addition to the current process, all alarm monitors were reminded of the escalation process for notification of nursing staff of patient alarms: -
·      For 'yellow' alarms, the nurse had five (5) minutes to correct the alarm.  The technician radioed the nurse every two (2) minutes until the alarm subsided and the nurse provided an acknowledgment that they had responded and checked on the patient. 
·      For 'red' alarms, the primary nurse was radioed immediately.  The primary nurse was to acknowledge immediately and respond within sixty (60) seconds.  If the primary nurse did not respond and the alarm did not subside within sixty (60) seconds, the charge nurse was radioed.  If the charge nurse did not respond, the alarm technician should physically speak to someone to ensure that the patient is responded to. 
·      'Red' alarms can no longer be silenced from the central monitoring station. 'Red' alarms can only be silenced at the patient's bedside by an RN. 
2. 'RN Response to Alarm Notifications' revealed:
·      The primary nurse must respond to and correct all 'yellow' alarms within five (5) minutes.  Each time a nurse was notified on the radio, he/she must give acknowledgment. 
·      The primary nurse must respond to and assess all 'red' alarms within sixty (60) seconds.  The primary nurse must acknowledge the alarm on the radio when received. 
·      If the primary nurse is unable to respond to the patient, it was the nurses' responsibility to escalate the call to the charge nurse or another nurse in the department. Th","**NOTE- TERMS IN BRACKETS HAVE BEEN EDITED TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY**  _X000D_

6.    INTERVIEWS
DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE EMERGENCY ROOM    (ED) MANAGER (RN #1) ON 09/24/18 AT 11:55 A.M. IN THE ED, THE ED MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT ED TECHNICIANS (TECHS) WERE ALL TRAINED TO MONITOR THE ALARMS IN THE ED.  HE/SHE STATED THAT NONE OF THE TECHS WERE QUALIFIED TO INTERPRET RHYTHMS BUT WERE TRAINED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TYPES OF ALARMS THAT WERE TRIGGERED. THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT ONE TECH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ALL THE ALARMS AND THAT THE CHARGE NURSE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE ASSIGNMENT.  THE ED MANAGER FURTHER STATED THAT THE ALARMS ARE MONITORED TWENTY-FOUR (24) HOURS A DAY, SEVEN (7) DAYS A WEEK.  THE MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT A RED ALARM INDICATED ANY FATAL, OR POTENTIALLY FATAL, VITAL SIGNS OR ARRHYTHMIAS. IF A RED ALARM TRIGGERED, THE TECH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE NURSE BY RADIO COMMUNICATION OF THE ALARM AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO TRIGGER THE ALARM.  THE NURSE HAD SIXTY (60) SECONDS TO RESPOND TO THE COMMUNICATION. IF THE ALARM IS NOT TAKEN CARE OF WITHIN SIXTY (60) SECONDS, THE TECH IS SUPPOSED TO NOTIFY THE ED CHARGE NURSE.  ALL NURSES ARE EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO AN ALARM, WHETHER THE PATIENT IS THEIRS OR NOT.  THE ED MANAGER ADDED THAT ALL NURSES ARE EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO ANY ALARMS IN THEIR PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE ED ALARM MONITOR IS THERE AS A BACK-UP IN CASE THE NURSE IS CARING FOR ANOTHER PATIENT IN ANOTHER ROOM AND CAN'T HEAR OR RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO THE ALARM.  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT THE ED MONITOR TECHS ARE COVERED DURING THEIR MEAL AND BREAKS.
DURING A FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW WITH THE ED MANAGER (RN #1) ON 09/24/18 AT 4:20 P.M. IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, THE ED MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FACILITY'S ED ALARM POLICY WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY THE RN #3 AND THE TECH (EMPLOYEE #4).  THE ED MANAGER ADDED THAT RN #3 SHOULD HAVE GONE TO PATIENT #1'S ROOM AND ASSESSED PATIENT #1 AFTER THE TECH NOTIFIED RN #3 THAT THE PATIENT'S RED ALARM HAD TRIGGERED.  THE ED MANAGER ADDED THAT THE TECH DID NOT FOLLOW THE ALARM POLICY BY NOTIFYING THE CHARGE NURSE AFTER SIXTY (60) SECONDS WHEN THE RN DID NOT RESPOND TO PATIENT #1'S ROOM.  ED MANAGER INDICATED THAT HE/SHE WAS WORKING THE 7:00 A.M. TO 7:00 P.M. SHIFT ON 09/14/18 AND WAS PRESENT IN THE ALARM MONITORING STATION WHEN THE CODE WAS CALLED FOR PATIENT #1.  ED MANAGER REVEALED THAT HE/SHE SAW ON THE MONITOR THAT THE ALARM HAD BEEN SILENCED IN PATIENT #1'S ROOM.  HE/SHE ELABORATED THAT WHEN THE ALARM WAS SILENCED AT THE MONITORING STATION, THIS ALSO SILENCED THE ALARM AT PATIENT #1'S BEDSIDE.   THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT HE/SHE SPOKE WITH BOTH RN #3 AND EMPLOYEE #4 AFTER THE CODE AND LEARNED THAT EMPLOYEE #4 HAD COMMUNICATED TO RN #3 MULTIPLE TIMES THAT PATIENT#1'S RED ALARM HAD TRIGGERED.  EMPLOYEE #4 HAD REPORTED TO THE ED MANAGER THAT RN #3 STATED THAT RN #3 HAD JUST BEEN IN PATIENT #1'S ROOM, AND THAT PATIENT #1 ""WAS FINE"", AND THAT RN #3 WOULD TAKE CARE OF PATIENT #1 ""SHORTLY"".  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT EMPLOYEE #4 CONFIRMED THAT EMPLOYEE #4 DID NOT CALL THE CHARGE NURSE TO REPORT THE RED ALARM PER THE FACILITY'S ED PROTOCOL.  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT RN #3 AND EMPLOYEE #4 WERE SENT HOME AND SUSPENDED IMMEDIATELY AND SUBSEQUENTLY TERMINATED ON 09/19/18 AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.

THE ED MANAGER INDICATED THAT PATIENT #1'S FAMILY IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT HELP FOR PATIENT #1, AND A CODE BLUE WAS CALLED. THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT IT APPEARED THAT PATIENT #1 WAS DOWN FOR POSSIBLY THIRTY (30) MINUTES BEFORE CPR WAS INITIATED.  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT HE/SHE NOTIFIED THE MONITOR VENDOR THE NEXT DAY, AND THE SETTINGS THAT ALLOWED THE TECHS TO SILENCE THE ALARMS FROM A REMOTE LOCATION WAS DISABLED.  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT THE ALARM COULD ONLY BE SILENCED FROM THE BEDSIDE AND AS PART OF THE NEW ED PRACTICE, THE ALARM CAN ONLY BE SILENCED BY LICENSED CLINICAL STAFF.  THE ED MANAGER STATED THAT THE ED STAFF WAS MADE AWARE OF THE POLICY CHANGES REGARDING THE ALARM SETTINGS, AND THE STAFF WAS RE-EDUCATED ABOUT RESPONDING TO THE ALARMS AND PATIENT CONDITION ESCALATION STATUS.  

DURING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE RESPIRATORY THERAPIST (EMPLOYEE #2) ON 09/25/18 AT 8:47 A.M., EMPLOYEE #2 STATED THAT HE/SHE WORKED THE 7:00 A.M. TO 7:00 P.M. SHIFT ON 09/14/18.  EMPLOYEE #2 RECALLED PATIENT #1 DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE # 'S INVOLVEMENT IN PATIENT #1'S CARE ON 09/14/18.  EMPLOYEE #2 EXPLAINED THAT HE/SHE WAS IN ANOTHER PATIENT'S ROOM THAT WAS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM PATIENT #1'S ROOM WHEN HE/SHE HEARD SOMEONE CALLING OUT FOR HELP.  EMPLOYEE #2 RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY AND SAW SOMEONE YELLING OUTSIDE OF PATIENT #1'S ROOM THAT PATIENT #1 WAS IN DISTRESS.  EMPLOYEE #2 RECALLED THAT UPON ENTRY INTO PATIENT #1'S ROOM, PATIENT #1'S FACE AND HANDS WERE BLUE, AND PATIENT #1 WAS UNRESPONSIVE AND PULSELESS.  EMPLOYEE #2 CALLED A CODE AND BEGAN CARDIO PULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) ON PATIENT #1. EMPLOYEE #2 STAYED AND ASSISTED WITH CPR FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN (10) MINUTES UNTIL PATIENT #1 WAS PRONOUNCED EXPIRED BY THE ED MEDICAL DOCTOR (MD).  EMPLOYEE #2 STATED THAT HE/SHE BELIEVED THAT CPR WAS PERFORMED FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT PATIENT #1 HAD BEEN EXPIRED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  EMPLOYEE #2 STATED THAT HIS/HER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ALARM SYSTEM WAS LIMITED. EMPLOYEE #2 STATED THAT THE ED TECHS ARE ALL TRAINED TO NOTIFY THE NURSING STAFF BY RADIO IF A PATIENT'S ALARM GOES OFF.  EMPLOYEE #2 REVEALED THAT HE/SHE WAS NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A RED OR YELLOW ALARM, OR WHAT DIFFERENT ALARMS REPRESENTED CONCERNING PATIENT STATUS.

DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ED MEDICAL DOCTOR (MD #5) ON 09/25/18 AT 9:36 A.M. IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, MD #5 STATED THAT HE/SHE WAS WORKING ON 09/14/18 AND REMEMBERED PATIENT #1.  MD #5 STATED THAT PATIENT #1 HAD NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED TO A PRACTITIONER, BUT THE PATIENT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED A BED, AND LABS WERE DRAWN PER THE ED PROTOCOL FOR NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND DIARRHEA.  MD #5 STATED THAT THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY TESTS BEEN RECEIVED AT THE TIME OF PATIENT #1'S DECLINE IN STATUS.  MD #5 EXPLAINED THAT PATIENT #1'S VITAL SIGNS WERE STABLE ON ADMISSION TO THE ED AND ADDED THAT IF A PATIENT CAME IN WITH UNSTABLE VITALS, OR IN APPARENT DISTRESS, THE PATIENT IS SEEN IMMEDIATELY BY A PRACTITIONER.  MD #5 STATED THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A NURSE TO REPORT THAT A PATIENT'S CONDITION HAD CHANGED, AND A PRACTITIONER WOULD RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE.  MD #5 STATED THAT ALL OF THE NECESSARY TESTS HAD BEEN ORDERED FOR PATIENT #1 TO HELP DETERMINE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE PATIENT CLINICALLY.  MD #5 RECALLED BEING MADE AWARE THAT A CODE BLUE WAS CALLED FOR PATIENT #1, AND MD #5 RESPONDED PATIENT #1'S BEDSIDE IMMEDIATELY.  ON ASSESSMENT, PATIENT #1 WAS PALE AND WITHOUT PULSE OR RESPIRATIONS.  CPR WAS IN PROGRESS.  MD #5 COULD NOT ASCERTAIN HOW LONG PATIENT#1 HAD BEEN WITHOUT PULSE OR RESPIRATIONS.  MD #5 FURTHER STATED THAT THE CODE RAN FOR APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN (17) MINUTES.  A CARDIAC ULTRASOUND WAS UTILIZED AT THE BEDSIDE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WAS NO CARDIAC ACTIVITY.  MD #5 STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY INDICATED TO CONTINUE WITH CPR BASED ON THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL STATUS.

DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ED CHARGE NURSE (RN #6) ON 09/25/18 AT 2:51 P.M. IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, RN #6 STATED THAT RN #6 WAS WORKING THE 7:00 A.M. TO 7:00 P.M. SHIFT ON 09/14/18.

RN #6 STATED THAT HE/SHE DID NOT HEAR ANY ACTIVE ALARMS WHILE RN #6 WAS AT THE ALARM STATION.  RN #6 EXPLAINED THAT WHEN A RED ALARM IS TRIGGERED, IT MAKES A DISTINCT, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND, AND RN #6 WOULD HAVE HEARD THE ALARM UNLESS THE ALARM WAS SILENCED.  RN #6 WENT TO PATIENT#1'S ROOM AND OBSERVED THAT PATIENT#1 WAS RECEIVING CPR. RN #6 STATED THAT PART OF HIS/HER RESPONSIBILITIES WAS TO MAKE THE CLINICAL ASSIGNMENTS IN THE ED.  RN #6 STATED THAT HE/SHE ASSIGNED THE TECH (EMPLOYEE #4) TO THE ED ALARM STATION.  RN #6 ADDED THAT IT WAS HER PRACTICE TO ROTATE THE ALARM ASSIGNMENT EVERY FOUR (4) HOURS.  RN #6 STATED THAT SHE EXPECTED THAT THE NURSES ANSWER ALL RED ALARM NOTIFICATIONS IMMEDIATELY AND WITHIN SIXTY (60) SECONDS.  RN #6 STATED THAT IF THE PRIMARY NURSE IS UNABLE TO RESPOND TO A RED ALARM, THE RN IS EXPECTED TO ASK ANOTHER NURSE TO RESPOND OR TO CONTACT THE CHARGE NURSE.   RN #6 STATED THAT SHE EXPECTED THE TECHS TO NOTIFY THE CHARGE NURSE IF THE PRIMARY NURSE HAD NOT ANSWERED A RED ALARM NOTIFICATION WITHIN SIXTY (60) SECONDS.


7.    POLICY AND PROCEDURES
A REVIEW OF THE FACILITY POLICY, ENTITY PPMH, ""EMTALA"", LAST REVIEWED 03/13/17, REVEALED THAT THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION (""MSE"") IS THE PROCESS REQUIRED TO REACH WITH REASONABLE CLINICAL CONFIDENCE, THE POINT AT WHICH IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION EXISTED, OR A WOMAN IS IN LABOR. SCREENING IS TO BE CONDUCTED TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, BY PHYSICIANS AND/OR OTHER QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSON OR PERSONNEL (QMP) TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION EXISTS. WITH RESPECT TO AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS, AN MSE CONSISTS OF BOTH A MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC SCREENING.  
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND  (""EMTALA"") REFERS TO SECTIONS 1866 AND
1867 OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, 42 U.S.C. SECTION 1395DD, WHICH OBLIGATE HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SCREENING, TREATMENT AND TRANSFER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR WOMEN IN LABOR.
IT IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE ""ANTI-DUMPING"" STATUTE. AS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, PPMH PROVIDES TREATMENT TO PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND THEREFORE ITS CORE MISSION AS WELL ALIGNED WITH ITS EMTALA OBLIGATIONS.
(1) THE TERM ""EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION"" MEANS-
    (A) A MEDICAL CONDITION MANIFESTING ITSELF BY ACUTE SYMPTOMS OF [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]
          SEVERE PAIN) SUCH THAT THE ABSENCE OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION COULD REASONABLY BE
          EXPECTED TO RESULT IN-
        (I)  PLACING THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL (OR, WITH RESPECT TO A PREGNANT WOMAN, THE HEALTH
              OF THE WOMAN OR HER UNBORN CHILD) IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY,
        (II)  SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT TO BODILY FUNCTIONS, OR
        (III) SERIOUS DYSFUNCTION OF ANY BODILY ORGAN OR PART; OR
    (B)  WITH RESPECT TO A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS HAVING CONTRACTIONS-
        (I)   THAT THERE IS INADEQUATE TIME TO EFFECT A SAFE TRANSFER TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL BEFORE DELIVERY, OR
        (II)  THAT TRANSFER MAY POSE A THREAT TO THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THE WOMAN OR THE UNBORN CHILD.
CONTINUED REVIEW OF THE POLICY REVEALED THAT ""STABILIZE"" MEANS, WITH RESPECT TO AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION TO EITHER PROVIDE SUCH MEDICAL TREATMENT OF THE CONDITION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ASSURE, WITHIN REASONABLE MEDICAL PROBABILITY, THAT NO MATERIAL DETERIORATION OF THE CONDITION IS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM OR OCCUR DURING THE TRANSFER OF AN INDIVIDUAL FROM A FACILITY OR, IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR, THAT THE WOMAN HAS DELIVERED THE CHILD AND THE PLACENTA. EXCEPTION APPLICABLE TO INPATIENTS: IF A HOSPITAL HAS SCREENED AN INDIVIDUAL AND FOUND THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION AND ADMITS THAT INDIVIDUAL AS AN INPATIENT IN GOOD FAITH IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION, THE HOSPITAL HAS SATISFIED ITS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THAT INDIVIDUAL UNDER EMTALA.  STABILIZED WITH RESPECT TO AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION MEANS THAT NO MATERIAL DETERIORATION OF THE CONDITION IS LIKELY WITHIN REASONABLE MEDICAL PROBABILITY, TO RESULT FROM OR OCCUR DURING THE TRANSFER OF THE INDIVIDUAL FROM THE FACILITY OR IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR, THAT THE WOMAN DELIVERED THE CHILD AND THE PLACENTA.
A REVIEW OF THE FACILITY POLICY, ENTITY PPMH, ""EMERGENCY CENTER ASSESSMENT AND REASSESSMENT"", LAST REVIEWED 01/01/17, REVEALED THAT ASSESSMENT INVOLVES A BRIEF, RAPID ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL, LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS OR INJURY RELATED TO: 
AIRWAY
BREATHING
CIRCULATION
DISABILITY - GCS (GLASGOW COMA SCALE) AVPU (ALERT, VERBAL, PAIN, UNRESPONSIVE)
A SECONDARY SURVEY INVOLVES A MORE FOCUSED AND DETAILED EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT TO IDENTIFY OTHER, LESS SEVERE, NON-LIFE-THREATENING, ILLNESS OR INJURY.  AFTER THE ABCD'S HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE OBTAINED:
VITAL SIGNS:  A COMPLETE SET OF VITAL SIGNS, WHEN CLINICALLY INDICATED, INCLUDING PULSE OXIMETRY, ORTHOSTATIC AND PAIN SCALE, SHOULD BE OBTAINED.
HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENT OF BODY SYSTEMS, WHEN CLINICALLY INDICATED.  THE ASSESSMENT MAY BE FOCUSED ON ONLY THE AREA OF THE COMPLAINT, OR THE ENTIRE BODY.
CARDIAC RHYTHM:  WHEN CLINICALLY INDICATED (I.E.: CHEST PAIN, ARRHYTHMIA), AN EKG SHOULD BE OBTAINED AND MONITOR STRIP MOUNTED ON THE NURSE'S NOTES AS A BASELINE AND WHATEVER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RATE, RHYTHM OR ECTOPY OCCUR.
GLASGOW COMA SCALE (GCS):  SHOULD BE OBTAINED ON ALL PATIENTS WHEN CLINICALLY INDICATED (I.E.: HEAD TRAUMA, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS).  ALL TRAUMA PATIENTS REQUIRE AN ADMISSION GCS.

C.    TO PROVIDE A SYSTEM FOR THE REASSESSMENT OF ALL PATIENTS THAT CANNOT BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY IN THE EMERGENCY CENTER (EC) FOR CHANGES IN THEIR CONDITION.
FURTHER REVIEW OF THE POLICY REVEALED THAT ALL PATIENTS HAD AN INITIAL AGE-APPROPRIATE TRIAGE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED BY A REGISTERED NURSE (RN) TO DETERMINE THE ACUITY OF THE PATIENT AND TO DECIDE THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AREA FOR MEDICAL SCREENING AND/OR TREATMENT. ALL PATIENTS ENTERING THE EC WERE TO HAVE THEIR COMPLAINT ASSESSED BY A REGISTERED NURSE AND CATEGORIZED AS EMERGENCY SEVERITY INDEX (ESI) LEVEL 1, 2, 3, 4 OR 5.  THE ASSIGNING OF THE ESI LEVEL WILL BE BASED ON PATIENT ACUITY AND THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR DISPOSITION (ADMIT/DISCHARGE/TRANSFER).  PATIENTS WHOSE CONDITION INTERFERED WITH VITAL PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND REQUIRED IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION WERE BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO THE TREATMENT AREA.  PATIENTS WHO ARRIVED BY EMS AMBULANCE WERE TAKEN TO THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AREA BASED ON THE INITIAL TRIAGE.
FURTHER REVIEW OF THE POLICY REVEALED THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS TO THE POLICY: 
PATIENTS WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY
    I.    PATIENTS THAT ARE CLINICALLY STABLE AND REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH/PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED IN A QUIET AREA, PREFERABLY THE EC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AREA.

Based on a review of medical records, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, Agreement for Professional Emergency Services, policies and procedures, and staff interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to provide an appropriate transfer of an individual who needed inpatient pediatric psychiatric treatment for 1 of 20 sampled patient medical records reviewed. Patient #1 was discharged    to the custody of the police for transport to another facility.

Findings were:

Review of Patient #1's medical record revealed that on 2/14/19 at 7:03 p.m. Patient #1 was bought into the facility's emergency room    (ER) via an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance with chief complaints of suicidal ideations (thoughts of killing oneself), non-compliance with home medication regime, and scratching herself. Patient #1 was triaged (assessment by a nurse to determine the priority in which patients will be seen based on their chief complaints and signs/symptoms) at 7:03 p.m. by a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) and assigned a triage level of 5 (NON-URGENT per the facility ' s triage protocols).

The Medical Screening Examination (MSE) which was performed by Medical Doctor (MD EE) at 6:47 p.m. revealed a review of systems (including heart and lungs) by MD EE.  MD EE noted that Patient #1's psychiatric assessment findings were positive for suicidal ideations and suicidal planning (the person wants to kill herself and has formulated a plan to do so). The record review also indicated MD EE's assessment of all other body systems was otherwise negative. Physician EE also noted that Patient #1 was uncooperative. Review of ""Triage/Nurse's Notes"" dated 2/14/19 indicated that Patient #1 was awake, communicative, hostile, and aggressive, cursing at, and attempting to hit staff. The local County Sheriff ' s Office was notified and Officers responded.  Nurses' notes indicated that Patient #1 was placed into 4-point restraints (both arms and both legs restrained) with every 15 minutes monitoring. Patient #1's initial vital signs were blood pressure 120/64 (normal range 120/80), heart rate 107 (normal range 60-100), respiratory rate 18 (normal range 16-20), oxygen saturation (O2) (normal range 95%-100%) 96% on room air (RA), temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit (normal body temperature is 98.6).  Nurses' notes also indicated that Patient #1's height was 6' 3 inches (5' 3""), weight 145 pounds and that the patient had no known drug/food allergies. 
Patient #1's vital signs remained within normal range from admission through her release on 2/19/2019 from the facility into the Local County Sheriff's custody. Her comorbidities (presence of other illnesses) included seizure disorder (brain over-activity), mental retardation (developmentally slow), urinary tract infection (bladder infection), and depression (severe sadness). The medical record review further revealed that Patient #1's home medication regime included Trazodone (treats depression), Clonidine (treats attention deficit), Benztropine (controls severe reactions to medications used to treat mental illness), Fluphenazine (antipsychotic) and Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (antibiotic that treats infections). The record further revealed that the family of Patient #1 was informed by the facility's staff to remain with Patient #1 due to her being underage, however, said family member left requesting the Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS) contact be made. DFACS responded and stayed with Patient #1 throughout the hospital stay. Further record review revealed that Patient #1 resided with her grandparents and they did not want Patient #1 returning to their home. 
Review of ""Mobile Crisis Referral"" dated 2/17/19 indicated that Patient #1 had been in her grandmother's care for three (3) months, however, Patient #1's grandmother was hospitalized    at another facility. Patient #1 presented in a euthymic (normal) mood with a congruent (agreeable) affect and kept stating that she wanted to go to a group home or home with an assessor or downstairs to go and buy clothes. Patient #1 denied suicidal ideations stating that she didn't want to kill herself and that she wanted to live.
Continued review of the medical record revealed that initial medical orders included blood drawing for a comprehensive drug screen, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis (UA), and urine pregnancy. Laboratory results revealed that Patient #1 had a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which MD EE ordered antibiotic therapy.
The Form 1013 Certificate for Authorizing Transport to Emergency Receiving Facility and Report of Transportation (Mental Health) dated 2/14/2019 at 7:03 PM, was reviewed. The form revealed that the subject individual (Patient #1) appeared to be a mentally ill person requiring involuntary treatment in that he/she appears to be mentally ill, and presented a substantial risk of imminent harm to self and others as manifested by recently expressed threats of violence which presents a probability of physical injury to self and others. 
At 10:15 a.m. the local County Sheriff Officer was informed of LPN BB's desire to press assault charges against Patient #1. At 10:30 a.m., documentation revealed the local county law enforcement officers arrived at the facility and at 10:40 a.m. Patient # 1 was discharged    in the custody of local County Sheriff Officers. Nurse's notes from Patient #1's admission to the time the patient left the facility on  2/19/19 revealed that Patient #1 continued to exhibit aggressive and violent behavior including screaming, cursing, hitting, attempting to bite, kicking, refusal to follow instructions to stay in her room, attempting multiple times to enter other patients '  rooms, running outside, attempting to stab a DFACS representative with a plastic knife, eating Styrofoam, urinating and defecating on herself and smearing feces (stool) on herself and over the surroundings. The record also revealed the staff's constant attempts to appease Patient #1 by providing frequent snacks and reading to Patient #1. Medications were administered as ordered. The Georgia Crisis and Access Line (mobile mental health assessment team) was notified. Local County Sheriff Office was notified. There were multiple attempts to place Patient #1 in 17 separate facilities, which declined the attempts due to various reasons. Review of Patient #1 ' s medical record failed to reveal a physician order discharging Patient #1 on 2/19/2019 to the custody of the law enforcement.  The ED record also failed to reveal documentation that Patient #1 was to be held by law enforcement until transfer, as stated in the facility's policy. The facility failed to ensure that an appropriate transfer was provided on 2/19/2019 for Patient #1 who needed in-patient pediatric psychiatric care and treatment. Instead, on 2/19/2019 Patient #1 was discharged    to the custody of Law Enforcement to take the patient to another facility.
Review of the ""Medication Record"" revealed that Patient #1 was medicated due to her continued aggressive and violent behaviors as follows:   
2/14/19 at 9:12 p.m. Haloperidol (treats mental disorders) 5 milligram/1 milliliter (mg/ml) intramuscular (injection into a muscle) (IM).
2/15/19 at 7:47 a.m. Lorazepam (an anti-anxiety medication) 2 mg/1 ml IM.
2/15/19 at 9:17 a.m. Diphenhydramine (causes drowsiness) 50 mg IM.
2/16/19 at 9:11 a.m. Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM. 
2/16/19 at 8:43 p.m.  Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM.
2/17/19 at 4:09 a.m. Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM.
2/17/19 at 4:09 a.m. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM.
2/17/19 at 4:09 a.m. Haloperidol 5 mg/1 ml IM.
2/17/19 at 2:50 p.m. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM.
2/18/19 at 12:15 p.m. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM.
2/18/19 at 12:15 p.m. Haloperidol 5 mg/1 ml IM.
2/18/19 at 1:17 p.m. Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM.
2/18/19 at 4:16 p.m. Hydroxyzine (treats anxiety) 50 mg/1 ml IM.
2/18/19 at 4:16 p.m. Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM. 
2/19/19 at 1:56 p.m. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM.
2/19/19 at 1:56 p.m. Lorazepam 2 mg/1 ml IM.
2/19/19 at 1:56 p.m. Hydroxyzine 50 mg/1 ml IM.

Further review of the medical record for Patient #1 revealed that on 2/19/19 at 1:14 a.m., Patient #1 exited her room, screaming at staff and deputies and requesting food. Food was offered to Patient #1. Patient #1 refused and remained defiant. Patient #1 was restrained and medicated at 1:56 a.m. with Lorazepam, Diphenhydramine, and Haloperidol. Patient #1 continued to scream and yell at 2:00 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. From 3:30 am to 7:00 a.m., Patient #1 was calm with eyes closed. At 8:30 a.m. Patient #1 was combative, assaulting staff, scratching, hitting, and kicking. Local County Sheriff Office and the facility's risk management were notified. Restraints were applied to Patient #1 at 8:45 a.m. 
Review of the Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, signed by the Chief of Staff 1/16/13 and a representative of the Governing Body 2/14/13, revealed the following: 
II.  Discharge Policies
B.  No patient will be transferred to another medical facility until the facility has been contacted and arrangements have been made for the continuing care of the patient.
Review of the Agreement for Professional Emergency Services revealed the agreement was made effective on 5/1/17.  This agreement noted the following:
D.  Perform the necessary professional emergency and related services unless such services are refused by the patient, or the provision of such services requested by the patient or the patient's attending physician are unnecessary under generally accepted medical practices.  In such cases, the professional services requested shall not be provided and the Emergency Physician who makes such a determination shall note the reasons in the patient's treatment records.
E.  Perform emergency medical and related services in conformance with:
i.) Applicable federal and state statutes, local ordinances and the rules and regulations of Governmental agencies and applicable standards of accrediting agencies;
ii.)  Bylaws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures of the Hospital and Medical Staff.  
Review of facility policies included but was not limited to the following:
I.  EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STANDARD OF CARE, no policy number, last revised 3/2016, revealed that each ER  patient who is transferred to another facility will have documentation of treatments and measures taken to prevent deterioration of patient's condition.  Each ER  patient will be offered medical services by a licensed physician extender with ER  privileges or by a licensed physician who will determine the scope of assessment and render care for the patient's in need of emergency services.  It is the responsibility of the Chief of Staff to ensure compliance with this policy by all ED Physicians


III.  DISCHARGE OF PATIENTS FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, no policy number, last revised 3/2016, revealed patients treated in the ER  are discharged    when treatment has been completed and their condition has been determined to be stable. Written and verbal instructions are given pertaining to follow up care, specific for each individual case. 
IV.  CARE OF THE PATIENT EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS UPON PRESENTATION TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, no policy number, effective 3/2016, revealed the purpose was to provide and maintain a safe environment for all personnel, patients, and visitors of the Emergency Department (ED) and facilitate the provision of appropriate Mental Health Care.
POLICY:  Any person presenting to the ER  for a Mental Health Evaluation will first and foremost be treated for any emergent medical presentation (see Policy:  Emergency Department Standard of Care).  Once it is determined by the ER  Physician that no emergent medical presentation exists, or that treatment has been rendered to the patient that resolves or mitigates an emergent medical presentation, the process for facilitating the provision of appropriate Mental Health Care may be initiated.
PROCESS:
A.  Medical Clearance
1.  The patient will be medically cleared by the ED Physician prior to making an attempt to facilitate the transfer of the patient to an accepting Mental Health facility
2.  For these purposes, and in this facility, the term Medical Clearance will be defined as:
a.  Assessment by the ED Physician determining that the patient is stable for transfer to a Mental Health Treatment Facility via ambulance or law enforcement
b.  Obtaining appropriate diagnostics, as determined by the ED Physician, to support the determination that the patient is stable for transfer to a Mental Health Treatment Facility
c.  Although not necessary for Medical Clearance, a reasonable effort will be made to obtain a urine sample for Urine Drug Screen, as it will eventually help guide the patient's treatment.
C.  Non-Voluntary Patients
2.  Patients not appropriate for Voluntary Mental Health Evaluation:
a.  History of violence or currently exhibiting violent behavior.
c.  Requiring physical restraints.
d.  Any concern for the safety of Hospital staff, themselves, or other patients.
3.  If a patient is determined to be Non-Voluntary by either the ER  Physician or the Mental Health Evaluator, a Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Form 1013... must be completed and signed by the ER  Physician or Mental Health Evaluator.
a.  Form 1013 will be utilized for Mental Health....
c.  Completion and signing of either of these forms places the patient in the Protective Custody of Law Enforcement.
4.  All patients that are taken into Protective Custody and held in the ER  for Mental Health Evaluation and/or transfer to a Mental Health facility shall be provided a guard by the Law Enforcement agency having custody of the patient.
5.  A Non-Voluntary patient may be restrained physically or chemically if the ER  Physician orders restraints... 
7.  Non-Voluntary patients shall not share an Examination Room or Bathroom with any other patient and shall have a Law Enforcement Officer at his or her bedside at all times.
8.  Non-Voluntary patients shall receive disposable flatware on their meal trays.
9.  In the event that the patient becomes violent or is unwilling to remain in the ER  pending treatment and/or transfer, immediately call 911 and notify Law Enforcement.
10.  If a Non-Voluntary patient becomes violent or it is deemed by the ER  Staff that it is not safe for the patient, staff, or other patients for the patient to remain in the ER, the ER  nurse can request that the Law Enforcement Officer transport the patient to the Law Enforcement Center to be held until transfer to an appropriate Mental Health Treatment Facility can be arranged.  In this case, documentation in the patient's ER  Record must indicate that the patient is being held at the Law Enforcement Center until transfer.
11.  ER  nursing staff shall contact Hospital Administration and Risk Management if the patient is violent and the Law Enforcement Officer does not comply or remain at the patient's bedside, or for any other problems with patients.
D.  Minor Patients and Developmentally Delayed Patients
1.  Any patient under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian during the patient's entire admission to the ED.  At no time shall the Minor Patient be left in the ER  without a parent or guardian.
2.  Any patient that is Developmentally Delayed must be accompanied by a parent or guardian during the patient's entire admission to the ED.  At no time shall the Developmentally Delayed patient be left in the ED without a parent or guardian.
F.  Mental Health Evaluation and Disposition
1.  When the patient has been Medically Cleared, the process for Mental Health Evaluation and Disposition can begin.
a.  The ER  nurse should immediately notify Behavioral Health Link (BHL)/Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL) to request that a Mental Health Mobile Crisis Assessor be dispatched to the ER  to complete the Mental Health Evaluation.
i.  Upon arrival to the ED, the assigned Mobile Crisis Assessor will complete a Mental Health Evaluation provided by BHL/GCAL.
ii.  In the event that the assigned Mobile Crisis Assessor and the ER  Physician determine that the patient requires inpatient Mental Health treatment, the Mobile Crisis Assessor will contact the appropriate Mental Health Treatment Facilities to obtain acceptance of the patient.
b.  The ER  nurse may also choose to contact an appropriate Mental Health Treatment Facility for patient acceptance if it has been determined by the ER  Physician that the patient requires inpatient Mental Health treatment without a Mobile Crisis Assessor dispatched from BHL/GCAL.
G.  Discharge and Transfer of Voluntary and Non-Voluntary Patients Experiencing a Mental Health Crisis
2.  If it is determined by the Mobile Crisis Assessor and the ED Physician that the patient requires inpatient treatment at an appropriate Mental Health Treatment Facility, the transporting agency - whether it be EMS or Law Enforcement - will receive a copy of the patient's ED Record in its entirety to deliver to the accepting Mental Health Treatment Facility.
3.  If the patient being transferred to an appropriate and accepting Mental Health Treatment Facility is Non-Voluntary, the original Form 1013 or Form 2013 must accompany the patient to the accepting Mental Health Treatment Facility. 
However, a copy of the form must remain in the patient's ED Record.
4.  A Transfer Form is not required.

V.  PATIENT TRANSFER GUIDELINES, no policy number, last reviewed 3/2016, revealed the purpose is to ensure access to emergency care and patient safety when it is necessary to transfer a patient to another healthcare facility.
PROCESS:
1.  The patient will be transferred to another facility only after medical evaluation and when possible, stabilization. Initiation of treatment must be started to ensure, within reasonable medical probability that the transfer of the patient will not result in death or in loss or serious impairment of bodily functions, parts or organs.
2. The patient/family is to be informed of the reasons for, and the risks and likely benefits of, transfer and documented in the patient's record. The patient will sign consent for transfer.  If the patient is incompetent to make this decision, a person legally responsible for the patient (if available) should accept or refuse the transfer on behalf of the patient by signing the consent or refusal of transfer located on transfer form. 
3. The patient should be transferred to a facility that will meet the needs of the patient.
4. A physician at the receiving hospital must agree to accept the patient prior to the transfer.
5. Communication of clinical information between physicians must occur prior to transfer.
6. Copies of the patient's record, to include lab results, x-rays, and an appropriate medical summary must accompany the patient to the receiving facility.
7. Transfer arrangements are to be made with the County EMA (Emergency Medical Ambulance), Lifenet (emergency transport), or by the receiving hospital (such as the pediatric transport team). They are to be informed of the patient status so that qualified personnel and equipment will be accompanying the patient.
8. The nurse is to call the receiving facility's accepting unit, prior to transfer and give a thorough clinical report to the receiving personnel. A transfer checklist form is to be completed and a copy included with the patient's transfer records. The facility failed to ensure that their Policy was followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that patient #1 was transferred to a facility that would meet her needs.   There was no evidence of a physician discharge order, transfer form, acceptance by the receiving facility or receiving physician, risks and benefits of the transfer, or that copies of Patient #1's medical record were sent to the receiving facility. 
An interview was conducted with the facility ' s Risk Manager, RM AA on 3/4/19 at 3:15 p.m. in the Conference Room, RM AA explained that Patient #1 was in the ER  from Thursday 2/14/19 until Tuesday 2/19/19.  RM AA explained that while in the ER  Patient #1 was combative, soiling herself and throwing feces at staff and whomever was around at the time.  RM AA said the ER  staff attempted to call every psychiatric facility they could think of and Patient #1 was either put on a waiting list or refused due to the patient's history of mental retardation, no available beds, psychiatric facility's admission criteria, or the fact that Patient #1 was a juvenile. RM AA said that a total of 17 facilities were notified and none would/could accept Patient #1. RM AA said that she contacted DFACS and the DFACS Supervisor informed RM AA that DFACS could not take custody of Patient #1 and that they (DFACS) could not help with Patient #1's placement. RM AA stated that she was called to the ER  on 2/19/19 because Patient #1 had physically assaulted LPN BB.  The RM said LPN BB reported that Patient #1 had assaulted her and that she (LPN BB) had called the local Sheriff's Office to report the assault. RM AA said LPN BB reported being kicked and slapped by Patient #1.  RM AA explained that when she arrived in the ER  a local Sheriff's Officer was already in the ED.  The RM explained that LPN BB asked the Sheriff's Officer if he could stay in the ED with Patient #1 or if Patient #1 could be arrested on assault charges. RM AA said she asked the officers if they could contact someone that could help with Patient #1 and was told to contact the Chief of the Sheriff's Department. RM AA stated she called the local Sheriff's Department and was instructed to call the local Superior Court Judge. RM AA reported that she called the Judge's secretary, explained the situation, and asked for help. RM AA said an hour and a half later a Sheriff's Deputy arrived with a 1013 (Georgia's legal document that allows a patient to be held involuntarily when the patient is determined to pose a threat to self or others) signed by the Judge. RM AA went on to explain that the ER  staff had exhausted every effort to care for Patient #1 and that the facility was totally out of Haldol and Ativan and that nothing was controlling the patient's violent outbursts. RM AA said the physicians were leery about giving the patient anything stronger because of the patient's age. RM AA said the ER  physician working in the ER  on 2/19/19 refused to release the patient to the officers until he had cleared the patient medically. RM AA explained that the facility did not know that the Sheriff's Officers had taken Patient #1 to another hospital until a call was received from the acute care (receiving) hospital on [DATE] a few hours after Patient #1 was taken into custody by the Sheriff's Officers. 
An interview was conducted with LPN BB on 3/5/19 at 10:30 a.m. in the Conference Room, LPN BB explained that she worked Friday 2/15/19, Saturday 2/16/19, Sunday 2/17/19 and Tuesday 2/19/19 in the ER.  The LPN said that it took all ER  staff on duty to deal with Patient #1 and that the RN on the Medical-Surgical Unit also had to respond to the ER  a couple of times to assist with Patient #1. The LPN confirmed that Patient #1 went from being calm one minute to being aggressive, combative, threatening and non-compliant the next minute. The LPN said Patient #1 would constantly come out of her ER  room and try to leave the ER. LPN BB said there was a DFACS worker at Patient #1 ' s bedside 24 hours a day, but that the DFACS workers did not assist with keeping the patient in the room. LPN BB explained that on 2/19/19 LPN BB was physically and mentally beat-up and was at times scared of Patient #1. LPN BB said that on 2/19/19 Patient #1 was hitting and kicking staff and also spitting and pulling staffs' hair.  LPN BB said that on 2/19/19 Patient #1's anger and violence had escalated, and staff could not get Patient #1 physically restrained and could not safely administer any medications to Patient #1.  LPN BB explained that she called the local Sheriff's Office because she thought that an officer would come and help control Patient #1 or they would take Patient #1 to jail.  LPN BB said she told the Sheriff's Officer that she wanted to press charges against Patient #1 for assault.  LPN BB said an officer got her information, and then the officer called his supervisor. LPN BB said a little while later an officer arrived with a 1013 that had been signed by the local Superior Court Judge.  LPN BB said the Sheriff's Officer took Patient #1 into custody and removed Patient #1 from the ED.  LPN BB said the Sheriff's Officer did not tell the ER  staff where he was taking Patient #1. LPN BB confirmed that she has EMTALA training annually. 
An interview was conducted with Pharmacist GG on 3/5/19 at 12:30 p.m. in the Conference Room, the Pharmacist confirmed that Patient #1 received numerous doses of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl (antipsychotic/sedative medications). The Pharmacist explained that the facility has two (2) Pyxis (medication dispenser) machines, one (1) in the ER  and one (1) on the Medical-Surgical Unit and that the ER  nurses had used all the Haldol in stock.  The Pharmacist said during the time Patient #1 was in the ER  there was also another psychiatric patient in the ER  and between the two (2) patients the facility's Haldol stock had been depleted. The Pharmacist said that she tried to order additional Haldol on Friday 2/15/19 and Haldol was on back-order. The Pharmacist went on to explain that the Haldol order did not arrive until 2/19/19. The Pharmacist went on to explain that Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl are used to calm/sedate patients but that sometimes these medications have the opposite effect on teenagers. The Pharmacist confirmed that the facility did not have any other approved antipsychotic/sedative medications available to be administered to Patient #1.   
A telephone interview was conducted with Physician EE on 3/5/19 at 1:30 p.m.  The Physician explained that Patient #1's grandfather notified law enforcement and the local EMS because Patient #1 was exhibiting suicidal ideations.  Physician EE said that once Patient #1 arrived in the ER  Patient #1's grandfather refused to stay with Patient #1 and did not want Patient #1 back in his home. Physician EE explained that Patient #1's grandfather informed the ER  staff that they should call DFACS. Physician EE said that upon arrival Patient #1 was agitated and uncooperative.  Physician EE explained that the patient's behavior included hitting and kicking the staff, throwing things, going in and out of her ER  room and that Patient #1 was a constant risk of eloping (leaving without notifying staff) the ER. Physician EE said chemical restraints (medications used to calm/sedate) and physical restraints were ordered for the safety of Patient #1 and others. Physician EE said DFACS and the local law enforcement agencies had been contacted for assistance in managing Patient #1. Physician EE went on to explain that 17 psychiatric facilities had been contacted and that none could or would accept Patient #1. Physician EE said that he was not on duty when Patient #1 was taken into custody by the local Sheriff Officers. Physician EE said that he had EMTALA training approximately two (2) years ago.   
An interview was conducted with LPN FF on 3/5/19 at 10:30 a.m. in the Conference Room. LPN FF explained that she worked in the ER  on Thursday 2/14/19, Friday 2/15/19, Saturday 2/16/19, and Sunday 2/17/19.  LPN FF explained that Patient #1 arrived by ambulance from a family home. LPN FF said that upon arrival Patient #1 was irate, screaming, cursing, and asking the EMT to slap/punch her in the face. LPN FF said she tried to calm Patient #1 and Patient #1 cursed at her.  LPN FF said Patient #1 was calm when sedated and other times kicking, scratching, and spitting at staff.  LPN FF said Patient #1 threw feces (stool) at staff.  LPN FF said the mental health assessors evaluated Patient #1 and they informed the ER  staff that there were only three (3) facilities that would accept Patient #1 due to Patient #1's mental retardation.  LPN FF said numerous psychiatric facilities were contacted and they could not or would not accept Patient #1 either because of no available beds, that the patient did not meet their criteria, the patient's history of mental retardation, or the fact that the patient was a juvenile.  
An interview was conducted with Sheriff's Deputy HH on 3/5/19 at 3:00 p.m. in the Conference Room.  Deputy HH explained that on 2/19/19 he received a call to respond to an unruly patient in the ER  that had assaulted a nurse. Deputy HH said that when he arrived he called his Supervisor and informed the Supervisor of the situation. 
Deputy HH said later he received a 1013 that was signed by the local Superior Court Judge and instructions to take Patient #1 into custody. Deputy HH said Patient #1 was taken into custody and removed from the ER. Deputy HH stated that his Supervisor called later and instructed Deputy HH to take Patient #1 to another acute care hospital (the receiving facility). Deputy HH confirmed that at no time did the hospital staff ask him to take the patient to another facility. 
Numerous attempts were made on 3/4/19 and 3/5/19 to contact Physician CC (the physician on duty on 2/19/19 when Patient #1 was released to the Sheriff Officers).  Physician CC was out-of-town and unavailable for an interview. 
There was no evidence of a discharge order, transfer form, acceptance by the receiving facility or receiving physician, risks and benefits of the transfer, or that copies of Patient #1's medical record were sent to the receiving facility.

A.  THE ER  NURSE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LINK (BHL)/GEORGIA CRISIS AND ACCESS LINE (GCAL) TO REQUEST THAT A MENTAL HEALTH MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR BE DISPATCHED TO THE ER  TO COMPLETE THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION.
I.  UPON ARRIVAL TO THE ED, THE ASSIGNED MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR WILL COMPLETE A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION PROVIDED BY BHL/GCAL.
II.  IN THE EVENT THAT THE ASSIGNED MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR AND THE ER  PHYSICIAN DETERMINE THAT THE PATIENT REQUIRES INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, THE MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR WILL CONTACT THE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES TO OBTAIN ACCEPTANCE OF THE PATIENT.
B.  THE ER  NURSE MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO CONTACT AN APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY FOR PATIENT ACCEPTANCE IF IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY THE ER  PHYSICIAN THAT THE PATIENT REQUIRES INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WITHOUT A MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR DISPATCHED FROM BHL/GCAL.
G.  DISCHARGE AND TRANSFER OF VOLUNTARY AND NON-VOLUNTARY PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS
2.  IF IT IS DETERMINED BY THE MOBILE CRISIS ASSESSOR AND THE ED PHYSICIAN THAT THE PATIENT REQUIRES INPATIENT TREATMENT AT AN APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY, THE TRANSPORTING AGENCY - WHETHER IT BE EMS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT - WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF THE PATIENT'S ED RECORD IN ITS ENTIRETY TO DELIVER TO THE ACCEPTING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY.
3.  IF THE PATIENT BEING TRANSFERRED TO AN APPROPRIATE AND ACCEPTING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY IS NON-VOLUNTARY, THE ORIGINAL FORM 1013 OR FORM 2013 MUST ACCOMPANY THE PATIENT TO THE ACCEPTING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY. 
HOWEVER, A COPY OF THE FORM MUST REMAIN IN THE PATIENT'S ED RECORD.
4.  A TRANSFER FORM IS NOT REQUIRED.

V.  PATIENT TRANSFER GUIDELINES, NO POLICY NUMBER, LAST REVIEWED 3/2016, REVEALED THE PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE AND PATIENT SAFETY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO TRANSFER A PATIENT TO ANOTHER HEALTHCARE FACILITY.
PROCESS:
1.  THE PATIENT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FACILITY ONLY AFTER MEDICAL EVALUATION AND WHEN POSSIBLE, STABILIZATION. INITIATION OF TREATMENT MUST BE STARTED TO ENSURE, WITHIN REASONABLE MEDICAL PROBABILITY THAT THE TRANSFER OF THE PATIENT WILL NOT RESULT IN DEATH OR IN LOSS OR SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF BODILY FUNCTIONS, PARTS OR ORGANS.
2. THE PATIENT/FAMILY IS TO BE INFORMED OF THE REASONS FOR, AND THE RISKS AND LIKELY BENEFITS OF, TRANSFER AND DOCUMENTED IN THE PATIENT'S RECORD. THE PATIENT WILL SIGN CONSENT FOR TRANSFER.  IF THE PATIENT IS INCOMPETENT TO MAKE THIS DECISION, A PERSON LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PATIENT (IF AVAILABLE) SHOULD ACCEPT OR REFUSE THE TRANSFER ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENT BY SIGNING THE CONSENT OR REFUSAL OF TRANSFER LOCATED ON TRANSFER FORM. 
3. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO A FACILITY THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT.
4. A PHYSICIAN AT THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL MUST AGREE TO ACCEPT THE PATIENT PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER.
5. COMMUNICATION OF CLINICAL INFORMATION BETWEEN PHYSICIANS MUST OCCUR PRIOR TO TRANSFER.
6. COPIES OF THE PATIENT'S RECORD, TO INCLUDE LAB RESULTS, X-RAYS, AND AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SUMMARY MUST ACCOMPANY THE PATIENT TO THE RECEIVING FACILITY.
7. TRANSFER ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE MADE WITH THE COUNTY EMA (EMERGENCY MEDICAL AMBULANCE), LIFENET (EMERGENCY TRANSPORT), OR BY THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL (SUCH AS THE PEDIATRIC TRANSPORT TEAM). THEY ARE TO BE INFORMED OF THE PATIENT STATUS SO THAT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT WILL BE ACCOMPANYING THE PATIENT.
8. THE NURSE IS TO CALL THE RECEIVING FACILITY'S ACCEPTING UNIT, PRIOR TO TRANSFER AND GIVE A THOROUGH CLINICAL REPORT TO THE RECEIVING PERSONNEL. A TRANSFER CHECKLIST FORM IS TO BE COMPLETED AND A COPY INCLUDED WITH THE PATIENT'S TRANSFER RECORDS. THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR POLICY WAS FOLLOWED AS EVIDENCED BY FAILING TO ENSURE THAT PATIENT #1 WAS TRANSFERRED TO A FACILITY THAT WOULD MEET HER NEEDS.   THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A PHYSICIAN DISCHARGE ORDER, TRANSFER FORM, ACCEPTANCE BY THE RECEIVING FACILITY OR RECEIVING PHYSICIAN, RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE TRANSFER, OR THAT COPIES OF PATIENT #1'S MEDICAL RECORD WERE SENT TO THE RECEIVING FACILITY.

Based on medical record review, policies and procedures review, Emergency Department Log review,  Staff interviews, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Blood Monitoring Training review, ambulance trip report review, personnel files review, and Blood Product Infusion Protocol review, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that the transfer was effected through qualified EMS crew personnel who were qualified to transfer patients with blood infusing; and  failed to utilize the transportation equipment (blood transfusion pump) during transfer for one (1) of 20 sampled medical records when Patient #1 presented to the Emergency Department (ED).  

An off-site complaint investigation was initiated on 4/27/2020 at 9:00 a.m., due to COVID-19 outbreak. 

MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW FOR PATIENT #1:

Review of Patient #1's medical record revealed the patient was a 7 -year-old  male that was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his mother on 3/14/2020 at 10:41 p.m.   The ED Central Log and Patient #1's medical record revealed the chief complaint was headache, generalized weakness, vomiting blood twice, and fever.  The consent for treatment forms were signed by Patient #1's mother at 10:44 a.m.   

At 10:54 p.m. the triage (assessment by a nurse to determine the priority in which patients will be seen based on their chief complaint, signs, and symptoms) nurse noted that Patient #1 ' s mother reported that the patient had surgery to remove his tonsils and adenoids on 2/26/2020 and had been having periods of vomiting since the surgery.  In addition, the nurse noted that the mother reported that Patient #1 had been having syncopal (fainting spells) episodes on 3/14/2020.  At 10:59 a.m., the triage nurse noted that Patient #1 was a level 2 emergent acuity and that Patient #1 was placed the ED room #3.  At 10:56 p.m., the triage nurse documented Patient #1's vital signs as follows:  temperature 98.1 (normal 98.6), pulse 126 (normal resting pulse for 7-year-old is 68 - 105), respirations 20 (normal for 6 to [AGE]-year-old is 12 - 24), and oxygen saturation 100% (normal 96 - 100%).

At 11:16 p.m., Physician JJ noted that Patient #1 had experienced multiple syncopal (fainting spells) episodes that day and had vomited blood once that afternoon.  The physician noted that Patient #1 was very pale and sleepy but awakened easily and answered questions appropriately.

In addition, the physician noted that Patient #1 was alert, active, and in no acute distress.  Physician JJ's orders included the following:
--Complete blood count (CBC - checks for increase or decrease in blood cell counts), 
--Basic metabolic panel (BMP - evaluates blood sugar level, electrolytes, and kidney function), 
--Hepatic panel (evaluates liver function), 
--Lipase (evaluates fat breakdown and can signify bowel problems), 
--Type and screen (blood test to determine blood comparability prior to blood transfusion); 
--Transfuse a unit of red blood cells, and
--Vital signs prior to starting blood, 10 minutes after transfusion is started, every 30 minutes until transfusion is complete, and one (1) hour after transfusion is completed.   


Review of the CBC revealed Patient #1's hemoglobin (HGB - protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body) was 3.5  low/ abnormal (normal for children 5 to [AGE] years old is 11.5 to 14.5) and hematocrit  low/ abnormal (HCT - measures the percentage of red blood cells in the blood) was 10.5 (normal 33 - 43%).

At 11:23 p.m., Registered Nurse (RN) FF noted that she placed a #20-gauge intravenous (IV - inserted into a vein) catheter in Patient #1' s left antecubital (elbow bend).  RN FF noted that Patient #1 was oriented and that his skin was pale.  At 11:29 p.m., registration was documented as being completed.

The receiving physician was listed, and the Risks was noted to include deterioration of condition, motor vehicle accident, and death, the benefits was noted to be further specialized care.  Estimated transport time was 2 to 3 hours.  Based on the risks and benefits, Physician JJ checked the form indicated that the medical benefits reasonably expected from treatment at the receiving facility outweighed the risks of transfer.  Physician JJ signed this form on 3/15/2020 at 12:35 a.m.  The consent for transfer was signed by Patient #1 ' s parent and witnessed by RN FF at 1:08 a.m.  The Acceptance Information form included the following:  names of the receiving hospital and accepting physician, mode of transport was noted to be by ambulance.  Departure from the ED was noted to be 1:15 a.m. on 3/15/2020.  Summary of Patient #1 ' s condition was documented as temperature 98.6, pulse 116, respirations 20, blood pressure 111/64, oxygen saturation 100%.  Right antecubital 20 gauge IV and red blood cells infusing at 120 milliliters per hour to the left 20 gauge antecubital IV.  Patient #1 was noted to be alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation, and lethargic (drowsy).  The nurse noted that Patient #1 ' s skin was warm and dry, and that respirations were even and nonlabored.  In addition, RN FF noted that essential portions of Patient #1 ' s medical record were given to the ambulance crew and a member of the ambulance crew signed receipt of Patient #1 ' s medical record.  RN FF noted that Patient #1 left the ED in stable condition.  At 2:03 a.m., a nurse noted that report was called to an RN at the receiving facility.  The nurse noted that Patient #1 departed the ED in stable condition on a stretcher for transfer to the receiving facility by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).     

The ambulance trip reported revealed Patient #1 was to be an emergent transfer to the receiving facility.  The primary impression was documented as bleeding, hemorrhage controlled or uncontrolled.  The trip report noted that the ambulance attendants arrived at the transferring facility on 3/15/2020 at 1:04 a.m. Paramedic GG noted that Patient #1 was lethargic but would open his eyes and answer questions appropriately.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (evaluates eye opening, verbal response, and motor response to determine a patient's responsiveness) was evaluated with each set of vital signs and Patient #1 remained within normal limits during transport.  Paramedic GG noted that Patient #1 received almost one (1) unit of blood during transport, but that at 1:50 a.m. she noticed that the blood was not dripping.  Paramedic GG noted that she flushed the IV site and that the IV was patent.  Paramedic GG noted that the blood bag was filling up with saline and the normal saline bag was filling with blood.  She noted that the transferring hospital was contacted, and an RN instructed her (Paramedic GG) to put the blood on a pump.  Paramedic GG noted that once the blood was put on a pump the pump was indicating that there was an occlusion above the pump.  Paramedic GG further noted that the RN was unsure what the problem was and informed her (Paramedic GG) that the blood should have been completely infused by 2:00 a.m.  At 2:55 a.m., Paramedic GG noted that upon arrival to the receiving facility Patient #1 was transferred to a stretcher and report given to the receiving nurse.

RN AA said the ambulance attendants said they had training in blood administration, but in his opinion the ambulance attendants did not seem to know how to trouble shoot blood infusion problems.  RN AA said that he was fired, and that the facility refused to let him complete a written report of the event for the Risk Management Department.  In addition, RN AA said that the hospital reported to the company he works for that he was let go because he made a medication error, was hard to work with, and had a negative attitude.  RN AA stated he had worked at the facility for two (2) years and never received a written or verbal reprimand.  RN AA confirmed that he has been an RN for five (5) years and has received EMTALA training at least once a year.

On 04/27/2020 at 9:30 a.m. the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) BB was informed that a possible EMTALA / Immediate Jeopardy (IJ) complaint was to be investigated.  At 10:40 a.m., the 1541A, CMS Data form, and a list of items needed for the investigation were emailed to the CEO and his Administrative Assistant.

During a telephone interview on 4/27/2020 at 11:10 a.m., Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) CC reported that the travel RN involved with transferring Patient #1 was terminated.  The CNO said that he suspects the travel RN is responsible for filing this complaint.  The CNO went on to say that the travel RN filed a complaint with The Joint Commission and the facility is getting ready to file a response.  In addition, the CNO said the travel RN had posted multiple inappropriate post on social media.  The CNO provided Patient #1's name and said the patient was seven (7) years old.  The CNO said that Patient #1 was vomiting blood upon arrival to the ED.  The CNO confirmed that the hospital owns the ambulance service and that the transport team had received training on monitoring blood.  The CNO brought in ED Director DD and the list of required facility documents was reviewed with the CNO and the ED Director.

During a telephone interview on 4/27/2020 at 11:45 a.m., the ED Director DD explained that the ED has 44 beds which includes 4 trauma beds, 4 rapid medical screening / fast track beds, and 36 general ED beds.  She explained that the medical screening examination (MSE) is performed by physicians or mid-level providers (nurse practitioners or physician assistants) under the supervision of a physician.  The ED Director confirmed that the hospital's EMTs and Paramedics receive training on monitoring blood as part of their annual competency testing.  

A second telephone interview was conducted with ED Director DD on 4/28/2020 at 10:40 a.m.  ED Director DD confirmed that Patient #1 is the only patient transferred with blood infusing and that the ED has not transferred any pregnant patients to other acute care facilities within the past six (6) months.  ED Director DD also confirmed that Patient #1 was transferred because the facility does not have a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit or staff qualified to care for critical pediatric patients.  ED Director DD said she did not know why the blood products were not infused prior to Patient #1 being transferred.  The ED's Quality Data was reviewed with the ED Director who reported that the ED uses a score card and tracks several things, for instance:  psychiatric patients for completion of medical records, random chart review, completion of the suicide screening, EMTALA paperwork, time to greet, and length of stay.  She stated that in less than two (2) years the ED has decreased the left without being seen (LWBS) patients from 9-14% to 1%.  The ED Director said the ED now has a provider in triage to help expedite care.  When questioned as to why Patient #1's blood was not put on a pump prior to transfer, the ED Director stated she did not know.  The ED Director said that it is facility policy to put blood on a pump and that RN AA was terminated for several issues which included behavior issues, refusal to give a statement, sending Patient #1 out without placing the blood on a pump, and for sending a second unit of blood with the ambulance attendants.  She went on to explain that the second unit of blood had to be wasted because Paramedic GG could not administer blood and that the wasted unit of blood could have been used for another patient.  

During a telephone interview on 4/28/2020 at 11:20 a.m., Director of EMS LL explained that paramedics receive training and have annual competency testing which includes intravenous (IV - administered into a vein) pumps.  He confirmed that the pumps used in the ED are the same ones used on the ambulance.  He stated Paramedic GG is a field trainer and has lots of experience with the IV pumps used on the ambulance.  The Director of EMS explained that paramedics in Georgia are trained to monitor and maintain blood once it is hung but that it is out of their scope of practice to initiate blood.  

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 9:30 a.m., Physician JJ stated he remembers Patient #1.  Physician JJ said that he completed his residency in 2012 and has practiced as a physician since then.  He stated he has been at the facility since 2017.  Physician JJ explained that Patient #1 was brought to the ED by his mother due to experiencing a syncopal episode (fainting) earlier that day.  Physician JJ said Patient #1 had surgery to remove his tonsils about two (2) weeks prior to coming to the ED and his mother reported he had been having intermittent (sporadic) vomiting.  Physician JJ said that the mother reported that Patient #1 vomited prior to coming to the ED and she noticed some blood in the vomit.  Physician JJ said that initially Patient #1 was alert and talking with his mother, he was Hispanic and was noticeably pale.  Physician JJ said he was concerned that the patient was anemic (low blood count) and that the anemia was causing the syncope.  Physician JJ confirmed that he ordered labs which revealed the patient's Hgb was 3.5, and a unit of blood to be administered.  Physician JJ explained that he did not call any of the on-call specialists because the facility does not have any pediatric surgeons or intensivist and that this patient's care was out-side the scope of the facility's pediatric department.  Physician JJ confirmed that he contacted the receiving facility and that Patient #1 was accepted by the receiving facility and the receiving physician.  Physician JJ said Patient #1 left the ED with blood infusing and that he was never notified that there was a problem with the infusion enroute to the receiving facility.  Physician JJ said he thought it was safe for Patient #1 to go by ground ambulance because the trip would not take long and that a helicopter would have taken almost as long because it would have to take off and land at this facility and at the receiving facility.  Physician JJ said he has not received word as to how Patient #1 is doing.  Physician JJ confirmed that he has received EMTALA training.  

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 10::00 a.m., RN FF stated she remembers Patient #1.  She explained that she has been an RN for 18 months and has worked at the facility for five (5) years.  RN FF said that prior to becoming an RN she was a Licensed Practical Nurse.  RN FF said that she and RN AA were working in trauma on 3/14/2020 when Patient #1 arrived and that she was the patient's primary nurse with assistance from RN AA.  RN FF said Patient #1 was placed in a trauma room and that all four (4) trauma bays can be seen from the nursing station down the hall.  RN FF said Patient #1 had a low Hgb and Physician JJ ordered a unit of blood to be administered.  RN FF said she checked the blood with RN AA and then RN AA hung the blood and monitored the patient.  RN FF explained that she was not in the room when Patient #1 was loaded onto the ambulance stretcher and that she is not sure if the blood was infusing appropriately.  RN FF confirmed that she received a call from Paramedic GG and was informed that the IV pump was alarming that there was an upstream occlusion (above the pump).  RN FF said she is not sure Paramedic GG knew what to do so I tried to help trouble shoot by asking if the tubing was clamped or if the patient's arm was bent which could occlude the flow.  RN FF said she is not sure how much blood was infused.  RN FF confirmed that she did not inform Physician JJ that there was a problem with the blood infusion.  RN FF said that the facility routinely transfers patients with blood infusing.  She went on to explain that when a helicopter comes to transport a patient there is an RN with the team and they often transfer patients receiving blood.  RN FF said she does not think the ground ambulance crew transfers patients with blood infusing very often but that the ambulance crew has transported patients receiving blood in the past.  RN FF explained that it is not in a paramedic's scope of practice to initiate blood but that a paramedic can monitor the blood but if they stop it, they cannot restart the infusion.  RN FF confirmed that she receives EMTALA training annually.    

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 10: 30 a.m., EMT HH explained that he is an EMTI, he went on to explain that an EMTI is an EMT intermediate and who has received additional training and is right below an Advanced EMT.  EMT HH confirmed that he remembers Patient #1.  EMT HH said he has been an EMT for 27 years and has worked at the facility for 5 years.  EMT HH explained that he and Paramedic GG received a call to pick-up Patient #1 and transport the patient to the receiving facility.  EMT HH stated they received Patient #1 from a nurse, but he does not remember which nurse, that blood was infusing but that he does not recall if the blood was on an IV pump.  EMT HH confirmed that he has received IV pump training but that it is not in an EMT's scope of practice to initiate or monitor blood.  EMT HH confirmed that he was driving the ambulance and could not hear what was going on in the back with the patient.  EMT HH said he receives EMTALA training once a year.

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 10:45 a.m., RN EE stated she remembers Patient #1.  She said she has been an RN since 2006 and has worked at the facility since 2008.  RN EE explained that on 3/14/2020 she was the ED Charge Nurse.  RN EE said she was notified by Physician JJ that Patient #1 needed to be transferred and that she called the receiving hospital.  RN EE said Physician JJ spoke with the accepting physician and then informed her (RN EE) that Patient #1 was accepted.  RN EE explained that she asked Physician JJ if Patient #1 needed to be flown or could go by ground transportation.  RN EE said Physician JJ informed her that Patient #1 could go by ground transport and that she then notified the EMS that a pediatric patient with blood infusing needed to be transferred to the receiving facility.  RN EE said she was made aware that there might have been a problem with the blood transfusion when she received a call from the receiving facility.  RN EE explained that she was informed that the receiving facility found tubing with blood and saline in the tubing that had been discarded in the receiving facility's trash.  RN EE said she gave the caller the EMS Captain's phone number.  RN EE said that a little later the EMS Captain came and spoke with her and Physician JJ and confirmed that he (EMS Captain) had spoken to the receiving facility.  RN EE confirmed that she receives EMTALA training yearly.

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 11:00 a.m., Paramedic GG stated she remembers Patient #1.  Paramedic GG said she was an EMT for 1 year, has been a Paramedic 6 years, and has worked at the facility for 6 years.  She explained that on 3/14/2020 she and her partner EMT HH received notice that there was a 7-year-old patient in the ED with a low Hgb that needed to be transferred to a higher level of care facility.  Paramedic GG stated that Patient #1 had blood hanging, that the blood was on a warmer, but was not placed on a pump.  Paramedic GG explained that it is not in the scope of practice for paramedics to initiate blood but that paramedics can maintain and monitor blood.  Paramedic GG said she received Patient #1 from RN FF and RN AA and was given a brief report about the hanging blood.  Paramedic GG said she informed the nurses that she had a pump on the ambulance and was informed by the male nurse (RN AA) that it would be alright as long as the blood is flowing.  Paramedic GG said that about halfway into the trip she noticed that the blood was not flowing.  She confirmed that the blood was not on a pump at this time and that she tried to flush the IV site to ensure that the site had not infiltrated.  Paramedic GG said she then called the ED and spoke with RN FF and RN AA for recommendations as to what to do.  Paramedic GG said the nurses recommended that the blood be placed on the pump and when that didn't work, they recommended discontinuing the blood.  Paramedic GG said she never spoke with Physician JJ.  Paramedic GG said Patient #1's vital signs remained stable during transport.  Paramedic GG said that when they arrived at the receiving facility, she placed the blood and tubing in a red biohazard bag and discarded it at the receiving facility.  Paramedic GG confirmed that this was the first time she had transported a patient receiving blood.  She stated that she had felt comfortable monitoring the blood when they left the ED.  Paramedic GG confirmed that once the blood started to backflow into the saline bag and the saline began to fill the blood bag, she noticed that the saline tubing was not clamped.  She said she was not sure if the saline tubing was clamped when they left the ED.  Paramedic GG said that a new Blood Protocol for EMS was sent out by their Medical Director around 4/20/2020 and that the new protocol requires blood products to be on a pump during transport.  Paramedic GG confirmed that she receives EMTALA training annually during the Annual Review Workshop.

A conference call (which was requested by the facility) was conducted on 4/29/2020 at 11:30 a.m. with the Assistant Chief of EMS NN, Manager of Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance MM, Director of EMS LL, ED Director DD, Director of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety OO, Risk Manager PP, and the Chief Nursing Officer CC.  The Manager of Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance explained that the call was to ensure that the Paramedic's competency in regards to monitoring blood infusions was clear.  The Assistant Chief of EMS explained that paramedics are taught how to monitor blood during their formal school training.  She went on to say that what is taught in school falls under pharmacology and that the facility's paramedics are also evaluated for competency during the paramedics' skills validation.  In addition, the Assistant Chief of EMS stated the skills validation includes monitoring after the blood has been hung and assessing for any blood transfusion complications such as allergic reactions or circulatory overload, and that if there is an issue the paramedic is to discontinue the blood.  The Assistant Chief of EMS further explained that trouble shooting tubing problems is part of the paramedics' skills validation that paramedics do and part of the National EMS Education Standards which the facility mimics for in-house training.  When informed that Paramedic GG's last competency/evaluation was 8/8/18, the Assistant Chief of EMS explained that paramedics are only required to have competency/evaluations every three (3) years.

During a telephone interview on 4/29/2020 at 12:10 p.m., the Manager of Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance MM confirmed that a second unit of blood was sent with Patient #1.  She stated that even though Paramedic GG informed RN AA that she could not hang the second unit RN AA had insisted the blood go with Patient #1 replying that maybe the receiving facility could hang the second unit.  


EMS BLOOD MONITORING TRAINING:

Facility documentation of EMS blood monitoring training included the following:
--On 4/29/2020 an email was received from the Manager of Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance MM.  This email had been forwarded from the Director of EMS LL who had received it from the Program Chair, Paramedicine of Southern Regional Technical College.  The Program Chair provided the following information:
This is to confirm that we do cover the maintenance of blood products initiated prior to transport. This includes: 
1.  Replacement therapy options (whole blood, packed red blood cells, platelets, etc...).
2.  Signs and symptoms of local as well as systemic reactions.  
3.  Common steps for safety (although Paramedics aren't involved with these steps):
--product identification by two (2) approved healthcare providers,
--confirming patient blood type,
--patient name and identification number has to be compared to the blood slip, 
--expiration times,
--administration times. 
4.  IV catheter gauge desired. 
5.  Filters and tubing.
6.  The Georgia Scope of Practice is always discussed: 
Paramedics may maintain a blood/blood product infusion started at the sending facility. This does NOT include the initiation of an additional unit of blood or blood product. 
Students are told to follow their local protocol and ask questions as needed for clarification on institutional procedures or any ""patient specific"" concerns that may present.

Based on review of the central log, policy and procedure, and staff and physician interviews, it was determined that the facility failed to ensure that each individual who presented on   a central log for a pregnant patient for 1 of 21 sampled patients (#21).  

Findings were: 

Review of facility policy entitled ""Emergency Medical Screening, Stabilization, Treatment and Transfer"" revealed that a list of all patients that presented to the ED would be maintained.  At a minimum, the log would contain the patient name, chief complaint, and disposition of case.  The log was to be maintained for five (5) years.

Review of the central log for 09/09/11 revealed no evidence of the pregnant patient (#21)having been registered on the log the day that she presented to the ED.

An interview (#7) was conducted at 10:00 a.m. on 09/28/11 with an obstetrical (OB) nurse in the administrative conference room.  The nurse reported being familiar with the pregnant patient from previous visits and stated that the patient called the OB unit late on the night of 09/08/11.  The patient reported having nausea and diarrhea.  The nurse gave the patient some advice on how to relieve the symptoms and recommended that she may need to be seen if symptoms were not relieved.  The patient was advised to call back in an hour to report on her status. The nurse did indicate to the patient that all beds in the Labor and Delivery Unit were currently full.  The patient called back in an hour and the OB nurse transferred the call to the OB physician who was on the unit at the time and was between cesarean-section deliveries.  The interviewee did not hear the conversation between the patient and the doctor.  However, the nurse was told later that the doctor had advised the patient to go to the nearest facility.  The interviewee reported that later during his/her shift the ED registrar called the OB ward clerk to report that the patient had presented to the ED.  The ward clerk conferred with the interviewee who recommended that the patient should follow the previous recommendations given by the OB doctor during their earlier phone conversation.  The interviewee had no further involvement with the patient but heard later that the patient had left to go to another facility.  The OB nurse reported that it was the practice that OB patients who presented to the ED were sometimes examined by the OB staff in the ED or brought to the OB unit for examination if space was available.  


An interview (#4) was conducted at 3:00 p.m. on 09/27/11 with a registrar in the administrative conference room.  The registrar reported that he/she was at the front desk in the ED when the patient arrived and stated that she was having contractions and needed to be seen.  The interviewee spoke with a staff member in the OB unit, as per routine, and informed the staff member that the patient was requesting to be seen.  The registrar was informed that the OB unit was full and that the patient should be instructed to go to a nearby facility.  The interviewee reported that he/she consulted with another registrar as he/she was unclear how to proceed.  The patient was not entered in the central log nor was the ED staff informed of the patient's arrival during the time the registrar was in contact with the OB staff. The other registrar contacted the nursing house supervisor who came and spoke to the patient and family.  The interviewee reported that he/she only heard parts of the conversation between the patient and the nursing supervisor.  At one point, the interviewee heard the patient ask the nursing supervisor what the facility would do if the patient was actually having the baby and the supervisor replied that the patient would then be seen in the ED.  The interviewee reported that the patient and family left the facility after speaking with the house supervisor. 


An interview (#1) was conducted at 1:00 p.m. on 09/27/11 with the Nursing House Supervisor in the Administrative Conference Room.  The supervisor reported that he/she was familiar with the event and confirmed that he/she was working at the time the patient presented to the hospital.  The interviewee reported that he/she was contacted by the OB nurse when the patient presented to the ED.  The interviewee went to speak to the patient who requested to see the Obstetrician (Interviewee #3).  The patient was informed that the Obstetrician was not available.  The interviewee reported that the patient did not want to be examined in the ED but only wanted to see the Obstetrician. The interviewee stated that the family then made a decision to go to Statesboro and left the facility.  The supervisor reported that once the patient had made the decision to not be examined in the ED, he/she felt that it was all right for the patient to go to another facility.  According to the interviewee, the OB physician was not informed that the patient had presented to the ED.  When questioned about the patient's refusal to be seen in the ED, the house supervisor confirmed that refusal for treatment had not been documented. The supervisor also confirmed that patient (#21)  had not been entered in the central log nor had a medical record been established.

An interview was conducted  with the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) and Quality/Risk Manager at 4:00 p.m. on 09/26/11 in the Administrative Conference Room.  The interviewees were aware that the pregnant patient (MDS) dated [DATE].  They confirmed that the patient (#21) was not entered in the central log. In addition, the interviewees reported that they were aware the the patient presented to another facility after leaving this facility.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy was  followed as evidenced by failing to maintain a Central Log on Patient #21 on 9/9/2011, a pregnant female in distress requested medical assistance.

4.  Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations

1.	A review of the facility's Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules, and Regulations, revealed that in addition to a physician, Qualified Medical Persons may perform a Medical Screening Examination. Individuals in the following professional categories who have demonstrated current competency in the performance of Medical Screening Examinations and who are functioning within the scope of his or her license and policies of the Hospital, have been approved by the Board of Trustees as Qualified Medical Personnel:  Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, Licensed Clinical Social Workers, and Psychologists, Nurse Midwives, and Labor & Delivery Registered Nurses for obstetrical patients.  The facility failed to ensure that their Medical Staff Bylaws,  Rules and Regulations were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a medical screening examination was provided for patient #21 on 11/3/2018 when a Nurse Practitioner and ED physician were on duty when the patient  presented to the ED.


5.  Advanced Practice Practitioner Schedule

1.	The hospital's Advanced Practice Practitioner's (APP) schedule for the month of November 2018 was reviewed. The APP's schedule revealed that an Advanced Practice Practitioner was in the ED and available to provide a MSE for Patient #21 on 11/3/2018. 


6.  Policies and Procedures

A review of facility policies and procedures included but was not limited to the following:

1.  EMTALA- Medical Screening Examination and Stabilization policy, revised 03/2017, revealed that the policy's purpose is to establish guidelines for providing appropriate Medical Screening Examinations (MSE) and any necessary stabilization or an appropriate transfer for the individual.  The policy further revealed that an EMTALA obligation is triggered when an individual comes to a Dedicated Emergency Department (DED) and
-- The individual or a representative acting on the individual's behalf requests an examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC).  
-- A prudent layperson observer would conclude from the individual's appearance or behavior that the individual needs an examination or treatment of a medical condition.  The MSE must be completed by an individual qualified to perform such an examination to determine whether an EMC exists or with respect to a pregnant woman having contractions, whether the woman is in labor and whether the treatment requested is explicitly for an EMC.  The facility failed to ensure that their policy and procedure were followed as evidenced by failing to ensure that a medical screening examination was provided  when a prudent layperson observed and concluded from Patient #21's appearance or behavior needed an  examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition of alleged sexual abuse.

If an EMC is determined to exist, the individual will be provided necessary stabilization treatment, within the capacity and capability of the facility, or an appropriate transfer as defined by and required by EMTALA.  Stabilization treatment shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (e.g. no different level of care because of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law.  The policy also revealed an MSE is performed by, only a qualified physician with appropriate privileges, other qualified licensed practitioner (LIP) with appropriate competencies and privileges or a qualified staff member who is qualified to conduct such an examination through appropriate privileging and demonstrated competencies.  An MSE, stabilizing treatment or appropriate transfer will not be delayed to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status or conditioned on an individual's completion of a financial form, an advance beneficiary notification form, or payment of a co-payment for any services rendered.  


2.  Abuse- (Suspected): Child, Sexual, Elder, and Domestic policy, revised 06/14/2018, revealed that the policy's purpose is to provide criteria which may be used by staff to determine if a suspicion is warranted, and to provide a mechanism for the initiation of medical and psychosocial intervention, as well as reporting to the appropriate agencies.  Continued policy review revealed a child is defined as any female who has not reached Tanner Stage 3 (has not begun menses) or is [AGE] or younger and any male [AGE] years or younger.  Abuse is defined as the willing infliction of injury (burning or hitting), unreasonable confinement such as tying to a chair, or cruel punishment such as withholding of food or medication.  Abuse may be physical, involve threats, insults or harassment and sexual abuse (including rape or sexual molestation/assault), is defined as unwanted sexual activity with perpetrators using force, making threats or taking advantage of victims not able to give consent to include children, adolescents, and adults.  Sexual abuse includes statements from the patient relating to sexual abuse, report from a physician indicating sexual activity at an early age, precocious knowledge of sexuality or sexual terms, presence of sexually transmitted disease in individual thought to be sexually inactive (due to age or physical incapacity), bruising, tears or lacerations to the genitalia and constant hand manipulation of genitals (children).  Sexual assault/rape includes trauma to external genitalia or rectum, torn clothing, bruises or lacerations to the head, evidence of sexual intercourse or presence of urine/feces, recent bathing or obsessive desire to wash/bathe, feeling of being dirty and verbal statement of assault.  The policy review further revealed that reports and suspicions must be pursed and presumed true.  Any staff member who suspects that a patient is a victim of abuse should report their suspicions to Social Services and/or the Nursing Supervisor/Immediate Supervisor.  Mandatory reporting required by law will be done by Social Services, Case Management, Emergency Department or Behavioral Health Services.  The procedure for reporting suspected abuse of children, required information includes the name and address of the person making the report (may use the hospital address), name/address of the child, parents and caretakers, nature and extent of any injuries or condition from suspected abuse or exploitation, any additional information useful in assessing the type of injuries and identifying the individuals and/or activities responsible, child molestation/sexual assault must be reported to a specific facility, law enforcement in the county the assault took place in must be notified, the crisis center (per facility policy) should be notified of all child patients of sexual assault or molestation to determine if a forensic exam is necessary and to schedule the exam to be done by the crisis center.  If the patient presents Monday-Friday from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., the crisis center is called to arrange for the child to present there for the exam. If the child presents after these hours, contact the on-call crisis center representative for direction.  The exam may need to be completed by the emergency department physician, depending on the time frame from assault to availability of the crisis center representative.  The crisis center representatives are available for consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  If the crisis center exam is scheduled for follow-up, the patient is discharged    with instructions to follow up as scheduled for the forensic exam and the patient still receives a medical screening examination and medical care as appropriate prior to discharge. The facility also failed to ensure that this policy and procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to  notify the ED Physician and Nurse Practice Practitioner that patient #21's mother had requested a medical screening examination and or treatment as appropriate prior to be told the facility could not provide an examination to an alleged  pediatric rape victim.

3.  Assessment and Reassessment of the Patient, policy # 14, revision date 11/5/18, provides a guideline to determine the care and treatment needs necessary to meet the patient's initial needs as well as their needs as they change in response to implementation of care and treatment plans.  The process is designed to provide each patient with the best care and treatment possible, taking into consideration the patient's physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physiological status as appropriate.  The policy further indicates that assessment and reassessment data are utilized to develop the interdisciplinary plan of care and to revise this plan throughout the course of care. The policy revealed that all patients presenting to the emergency room    are triaged (assessed) to determine the chief complaint and assign an acuity.  
--Triage is performed by a qualified Registered Nurse (RN) at the time of presentation and may be done in concert with a quick registration.  Triage is an information-collecting and decision-making process performed in order to sort injured and ill patients into categories of acuity and prioritization based on the urgency of their medical or psychological.  A triage acuity level must be recorded for all patients on all shifts, including ambulance patients.  
--The Triage Acuity Levels are as follows:
-Level 1 Resuscitation
-Level 2 Emergent
-Level 3 Urgent
-Level 4 Semi-Urgent
-Level 5 Non-Urgent
--Initial (Rapid) Nursing Assessment- Is part of the Triage Process and should be performed on all patients within 10 minutes of arrival to the ED.  A rapid assessment should be used when 2 or more patients are waiting to be triaged.
--Focused Nursing Assessment- A process of evaluation pertinent to the patient's chief complaint, condition, and symptoms.  Patients waiting for the initiation of the medical screening exam (MSE) shall have at a minimum a focused reassessment performed at least hourly or more frequently if condition and acuity warrant.

4.  Non-Discrimination Statement, policy # 28, revealed that the facility complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state, or local law.

7.  Credentialing Files

A review of two (2) credential files (#3 and 5) revealed the (2) files contained current state licensure and delineation of privileges.  The files included evidence of EMTALA training within the past year.

8.  Personal Files

A review of three (3) personnel files (#1, 2 and 4) revealed the three (3) files contained current state licensure and facility required orientation and competency testing.  The files (#1 and 2) contained evidence of EMTALA training within the past year.  File # 4 did not contain EMTALA training.

3. Review of a closed medical record revealed Patient # 22 presented to the emergency department (ED) accompanied by police on 11/21/16 at 11:58 AM complaining of muscle weakness, abdominal pain and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  

Staff C, ED Advanced Registered Nurse (ARNP) on 11/21/16 at 1:43 PM, documented in the medical record that patient # 22 was very lethargic during the initial assessment.  Further documentation showed the patient denied any recent drug use and acknowledged that he had not been taking his normal psychiatric medications as prescribed. 

Staff AA, Linn County Mental Health worker, notified the St. Luke's social worker about the pending committal of Patient #22 due to deterioration in his mental condition, non-compliance with his prescribed medications and multiple calls to the Police in the last couple of weeks. 

Review of the Court document signed by the local Judge November 21, 2016 at 3:59 PM (four hours after patient # 22's arrival to the ED), read in part,  ... [Patient # 22] is seriously mentally impaired and is likely to injure himself or others if allowed to remain at liberty.   ... [Patient # 22] shall be detained at St. Luke's Hospital  ... and that said matter will be heard  ... before said Court at St. Luke's Hospital on the 28th day of November, 2016 at 8:00 A.M.  Further the Court document indicated the ""On-Call Physician, St. Luke's Hospital"" was appointed to conduct a personal examination of patient # 22 to determine whether he was seriously mentally impaired.  

The affidavit in support of the Court document read in part  ... patient # 22 was homeless and over the past 10 days had been arrested 3 times.  His mental state was deteriorating.  Further documentation showed patient # 22 had been talking about silver flakes, Martians having taken over the world, and that he was scared to eat food because he felt it was poisoned.   

Review of St. Luke's psychiatric unit census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 27 inpatients (3 available beds) on the 2 East psychiatric unit on 11/21/16 and no open beds on the additionally secured North hall.

On day two of patient # 22's stay in the ED (11/22/16) at 12:03 PM, on-call Psychiatrist D evaluated patient # 22 and documented in part  ... the patient was ""currently homeless, living on the streets, has been refused by every shelter due to violence and does not appear to have family that can safely take him in.""   ...   Further documentation showed that in Psychiatrist D's opinion, patient # 22 was seriously mentally impaired, unable to make responsible decisions regarding his treatment and that the patient was so violent that ""our department does not have capacity to treat him on our unit"" due to significant  history of assaulting others.  Psychiatrist D recommended patient # 22 be placed on an anti-psychotic medication, both oral and injectable  ... ""Placing him on an anti-psychotic is not going to fix the problem of chronic dangerousness, and subjecting my nursing staff to repeated abuse will only land [patient # 22] in jail."" 

At 12:09 PM on 11/22/16, the ED physician documented, ""No issues during the day.""  ""Psych saw the patient in the emergency room   .""  ""We are trying to get him [patient # 22] committed to [Hospital B].""

At 12:23 PM, the ED mid-level practitioner documented in the medical record that patient # 22 remained shackled with police present, patient not fighting restraints, not agitated or aggressive.  Further documentation showed ""Psych plan is to transfer to [Hospital B] tomorrow.""   ... ""Have IM (intra-muscular) meds if needed for agitated (sic) but really is calm at this time.""

Review of St. Luke's census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 20 inpatients on 2 East psychiatric unit (10 available beds) on 11/22/16 and three available beds on the additionally secured North hall.

On day three of patient # 22's stay in the ED (11/23/16) at 6:35 AM, Staff J, Licensed Independent Social Worker (LISW) documented in the medical record that "". . . Patient up and down throughout the night but able to be redirected when awake.""

At 7:50 AM on 11/23/16, ED Registered Nurse (RN) F documented in patient # 22's medical record that St. Luke's would discharge the patient later today after a court order for admission to Hospital B was obtained.  Further documentation showed that staff at Hospital B told ED nurse F that they did not have any available beds.  

At 12:20 PM an ED physician documented that ""no acute concerns voiced during my period of care  ...""  ""I am concerned about this delay in care and the fact that he (patient # 22) has been restrained for so long.""  ""He isn't 'combative' per chart/notes, but occasionally verbally disruptive so not overly concerned about rhabdo (rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome whereby dissolution of skeletal muscle is caused by direct or indirect muscle injury), etc just his autonomy.""  ""I discussed this with the Linn County deputy [name] at 1220 who states that it is their policy and that they 'have to' keep him shackled and handcuffed unless we are doing a procedure.""  

At 12:35 PM on 11/23/16 an ED nurse documented in the medical record that he informed St. Luke's Behavioral Health Director that Hospital B reported they did not have any available beds.  Further documentation showed that the Behavioral Health Director ""replied that if they show up at [Hospital B] with the patient, it has been his past experience that [Hospital B] will 'find a bed.'"" Further documentation showed that the Behavioral Health Director ""directed that transportation be called to transfer."" 

At 12:45 pm, the ED nurse documented that staff at Hospital B ""continues to state that they do not have a bed available at this time.""

Review of St. Luke's census information by Staff A, Director of Behavioral Health showed there were 20 inpatients on 2 East psychiatric unit on 11/23/16 (10 available beds) and four available beds on the North hall.

During an interview on 1/5/17 at 10:20 AM, Other Staff AA, Linn County Mental Health Advocate, stated Patient #22 could get very violent but this time the patient was not anywhere near as violent as in the past.  

Review of Hospital B's medical record revealed patient # 22 arrived on 11/23/16, was admitted     to an open unit with other patients and did not require restraints or additional security.    

The evidence in the medical record indicated St. Luke's Hospital did not provide within its capabilities and capacity stabilizing treatment to patient # 22 who had an un-stabilized emergency medical condition from 11/20/16 through 11/23/16. The hospital's on-call psychiatrist documented refusal for inpatient admission on 11/22/16 and sought a court order for transfer to another acute psychiatric hospital even though beds were available in the psychiatric unit along with the presence of law enforcement and/or hospital security in the event patient # 22's behavior became violent.    

4. Review of a closed medical record showed that patient # 29(A) (MDS) dated [DATE] at 9:42 am complaining of increased shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness and profuse vaginal bleeding since last night (11/27/16).  Documentation by the Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) S at 10:20 am indicated patient # 29(A) had a previous admission to St. Luke's Hospital in October for treatment of a blood clot in her lung and right lower extremity and received a prescription for Xarelto (blood thinner) at that time.  Further documentation showed that patient # 29(A) reported being lightheaded when getting out of bed this morning and had a large gush of blood from her vagina with several clots.  Patient # 29(A) also reported having an appointment to see her OB/GYN (obstetrician/gynecologist) in one month.  In the ED notes, ED nurse Q documented that patient # 29(A) had a large amount of bright red vaginal bleeding with clots present; that patient # 29(A) appeared dyspneic (difficulty breathing) with even mild exertion; was pale, cool to the touch with dry mucous membranes that were also pale; and reported mild to moderate low pelvic discomfort. 
 
During the examination, ARNP S documented there was bleeding in the patient's vagina.  Blood for testing obtained at 10:36 am showed that patient # 29(A) had an abnormally low hemoglobin of 8.5 (normal 12.2-15.6 g/dL).   At 10:06 a.m., ARNP S ordered one-liter bolus (rapid infusion) of normal saline intravenous (IV) fluid.  At 10:08 a.m., patient # 29(A) underwent a trans-vaginal ultrasound, which identified multiple uterine abnormalities.  Further documentation indicated ARNP S contacted the on-call OB/GYN who requested to see the patient in their office tomorrow (11/29/16) at 1:45 p.m. for an endometrial biopsy.   
 
At 1:10 pm ED nurse Q documented patient # 29(A) got up, went to the bathroom to change her peri pad, and reported she was ""bleeding again,"" but is manageable at this point.""  At 1:42 pm patient # 29(A) was discharged    with instructions to follow up with gynecology the next day for a biopsy, and to return if bleeding continued.  

The medical record did not contain evidence that the hospital stabilized patient # 29(A)'s emergency medical condition, active bleeding while taking an anticoagulation (blood thinning) medication, prior to discharge from the ED.  
 
5. Review of a second closed medical record indicated patient # 29(B) returned to the ED by ambulance at 9:11 pm on 11/28/17, approximately 7 hours after discharge for continued vaginal bleeding.  Documentation in the medical record on the Pre-Hospital Care Report Summary indicated patient # 29(B) requested transport to St. Luke's Hospital.  Upon arrival, the paramedics documented patient # 29(B) was pale, sweating, had a low blood pressure 108/palpable - meaning the diastolic pressure was too low to determine (normal 120/80), a rapid heart rate of 134 (normal 70-100) and were unable to establish intravenous (IV) access.  Further documentation showed the patient arrived at the ED at 9:08 pm on 11/28/17.

ED physician R documented patient # 29(B) had a history of blood clots in the lungs, had been prescribed long term use of anticoagulant medication (to prevent blood clots from forming) and was currently experiencing uterine bleeding possibly due to cancer.  Further documentation showed patient # 29(B) stated she was scheduled to have a biopsy tomorrow with OB (obstetrics) for concerns of cancer.  At 9:21 pm, blood obtained for testing indicated patient # 29(B)'s hemoglobin was 7.3 g/dL down from 8.5 g/dL prior to discharge from the ED earlier in the day.  The ED physician ordered 2 units of blood for immediate transfusion.  Further documentation showed the ED physician R talked to the gynecologist on-call, ""he recommended that the patient be transferred to Hospital D for further evaluation and treatment.""   During the blood transfusion at 11:12 pm, patient # 29(B) was transferred to Hospital D.    
 
The evidence in the medical record indicated patient # 29(B) had an emergency medical condition (EMC) that was not stabilized within the hospital's capabilities, continued blood loss while taking a blood thinning medication.  The benefits of transfer were ""need for diagnostic equipment/tests"" which did not outweigh the risks of ""bleeding/shock; loss of limb and/or fracture complications; additional delay in receiving appropraite treatment"" as documented in the medical record.  The on-call GYN physician did not come to the ED to examine the patient.  St. Luke's Hospital had the capabilities including but not limited to, 532 hospital beds, an on-call GYN physician, an on-call surgeon, on-call hospitalists, a cancer treatment center, a medical/surgical intensive care unit, and diagnostic radiology services.

Based on document review and staff interview, the hospital's Emergency Department (ED) staff failed to maintain a central log and add the name of 1 of 33 patients (Patient #6) who presented to the ED requesting emergency care between 7:00 PM on 10/15/14 and 7:00 AM of 10/16/14. Patient #6 arrived at the hospital by ambulance at about 3:30 AM on 10/16/14. The surveyor selected  25 ED patients and 5 obstetric patients for the sample. 

Failure to enter the the information for Patient #6 into the hospital's central log was not in compliance with the Hospital's EMTALA policy and is a violation of EMTALA
 
Findings include:

1. Review of the facility's EMTALA Policy, last reviewed 7/14 revealed the following information.  The policy required the ED at Great River Medical Center (GRMC) to ""maintain a central log containing information of each individual who comes the on the GRMC campus requesting assistance...the emergency department log contains: Patient name...time and nature of the complaint, through the computerized registration process.""

2. Review of the ED log showed 32 patients were listed on the log from 7:00 PM on 10/15/14 and 7:00 AM on 10/16/14. Information regarding the presence of Patient #6 in the hospital's ED log was missing. 

Patient #6 came to the hospital by ambulance and arrived in the hospital's ambulance garage at 3:30 AM and left in the ambulance to the receiving hospital about 30 minutes later. The patient never left the ambulance and never received a medical screening exam to ascertain whether the patient had an emergency medical condition. The hospital did not have a medical record for Patient #6 on 10/16/14.

3. During an interview with Staff G, the Vice President of Nursing, on 10/21/14 at 12:25 PM, Staff G verified the ED staff failed to follow the hospital's EMTALA policy when they did not register Patient #6 into the central log.

Based on interviews, review of Facility #1's video surveillance footage, review of Facility #1's Emergency Department (ED) registration logbook and policies, and review of medical records from Facility #2 and Facility #3, it was determined the facility failed to ensure a medical examination and stabilizing medical treatment were provided for one (1) of twenty-one (21) sampled patients (Patient #1) that presented to Facility #1's Emergency Department (ED) for treatment.  

Interviews and review of Facility #1's ED video footage revealed Patient #1's family member (MDS) dated [DATE] and informed ED Registration Clerk #2 that Patient #1 was in the parking lot, in labor, and ready to push.  ED Registration Clerk #2 informed Patient #1's family member that Facility #1 did not offer Obstetric (OB) services and no longer employed any OB nurses.  Interviews revealed Patient #1's family left Facility #1 with Patient #1; however, review of Facility #1's ED log revealed no documented evidence that Patient #1 ever (MDS) dated [DATE].  Interviews and record review revealed after leaving Facility #1, Patient #1's family member drove to Facility #2 (a critical access hospital 16 miles away), and the patient delivered Twin A in the parking lot and Twin B in the ED of Facility #2.  Facility #2 then transferred Patient #1, Twin A, and Twin B to Facility #3 (18 miles away).  Facility #3 admitted     and assessed the patients, but arranged for Twin A and Twin B to be transferred to Facility #4 (89 miles away) due to their inability to provide the level of care the twins required.  Patient #1 was treated at Facility #3 for Undiagnosed    Pregnancy, Previous Cesarean Section, Precipitous Delivery of Twins, Postpartum Bleeding, Severe Anemia, and Uterine Blood Clots and was discharged    on [DATE].  Attempts to obtain the twins' medical records from Facility #4 were unsuccessful.

Based on observations, interviews and record reviews, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24(r) and 489.24(c)  in regard to providing an appropriate medical screening within the capability of the hospital's emergency department (ED) and 42 CFR 489.24(d)(1-3) in regard to providing a patient with an emergency medical condition, further examination and treatment required to stabilize the medical condition for one patient (#1) in the selected sample of 21.  The facility failed to ensure their policies  ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" and ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" were followed.  Findings include:

Review of the facility policy ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" revealed ""Every person presenting to the Emergency Department shall receive an appropriate medical screening examination.  This examination must be sufficient to determine if the person has an emergency medical condition.""  Review of the facility policy ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" revealed ""the initial medical screening examination must be conducted by qualified medical personnel to determine with reasonable confidence whether an emergency medical condition exists.  The medical screening examination should be an ongoing process accompanied by a record that reflects continuous monitoring of the patient.  An emergency medical condition is a condition whose acute symptoms are severe enough that without immediate medical attention, it is expected to jeopardize the health of the individual, seriously impair bodily function, or cause serious dysfunction of any organ or body part.  Symptoms include pain, psychiatric disturbances, and substance abuse."" 

Observations of a video of Patient #1 taken on 03/19/11 in the Emergency Department (ED) revealed the following:  Patient #1 entered the behavioral health room in the ED and sat down on the end of the stretcher.  Patient #1's hands were cuffed and his/her legs were shackled. Outside of the room was a Deputy Jailor and a facility Security Officer.  Observations revealed Patient #1's assigned ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was observed for 36 seconds in the hall area outside of Patient #1's ED room.  During the 36 seconds ED Physician #2 was talking with the Deputy Jailor in the hallway, then moved into the doorway where Patient #1 could be viewed for 4 seconds, and then he left the area.  On a second occasion Physician #2 came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room and looked into the room for 5 to 6 seconds and walked off.  Neither of the times that ED Physician #2 came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room did the physician have a conversation with Patient #1 or conduct an examination. 

A review of Patient #1's ED medical record for 03/19/11 revealed he/she presented to the ED at 1437 accompanied by the police (from jail).  The police had a ""Uniform Citation"" that was presented to the facility which charged Patient #1 with ""Arrest, person is mentally ill and a danger to self and others.""  Patient #1 was brought to the facility ED by order of the County Attorney. 

An interview with ED Physician #1 on 03/29/11 at 2:15 PM, revealed he was staffed in the ED on 03/19/11 when Patient #1 was in the ED but he did not perform a medical screening on Patient #1.  He stated ED Physician #2 was the assigned physician to Patient #1 on 03/19/11.

An interview with ED Physician #2 on 03/29/11 at 3:35 PM, revealed the medical screening consisted of  ""primarily a mental evaluation.""  He stated he did not review any of Patient #1's previous ED and/or hospital admissions.  He stated initially there was no conversation with Patient #1 because it was ""obviously pointless.""  He stated he could not ask Patient #1 any questions or do a formal evaluation.  After the medication was given and Patient #1 began calming down he stated he looked in on Patient #1 but did not examine the patient.  ED Physician #2 stated he felt Patient #1 was oriented and coherent.  He felt she was ""clearly not suicidal.""  He stated he did not call Behavioral Health to assess because he felt that Patient #1 knew what he/she was saying.

An interview with the Deputy Jailor on 03/30/11 at 11:45 AM, revealed Patient #1 was brought to the ED on 03/19/11 for a mental evaluation because Patient #1 had been throwing food in the jail, washing his/her hair with toilet water, not sleeping, acting bizarre, talking out of his/her head making statements about being pregnant with twins, and talking about the devil.  The Deputy Jailor stated he did not observe the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) go into the room and examine or talk to Patient #1 anytime during the ED visit.  After returning to the jail Patient #1 slept through the night.  The next day Patient #1's behavior began escalating again.  After the effects of the medication, that was administered in the ED wore off, Patient #1 began screaming out and talking about being pregnant again.  Patient #1 required tazing on 03/20/11 due to his/her behavior.  On 03/21/11 Patient #1 was evaluated by a Mental Health Professional and Patient #1 was sent to a psychiatric hospital for admission.   

The facility failed to ensure their policies ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" and ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" were followed in regard to conducting    an appropriate medical screening examination to determine if an emergency medical condition existed for Patient #1.  The failure resulted in Patient #1 being tazed while in jail and sustaining bruising and black eyes from head banging.  Additionally, the facility failed to provide further psychiatric examination, treatment, and stabilization for Patient #1 on 03/19/11.

Based on observations, interviews and record reviews, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one patient (#1) in the selected sample of 21 received an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department (ED).  The facility failed to follow their policies ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" and ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" resulting in Patient #1 not receiving an appropriate medical screening to determine if an emergency medical condition existed.  Findings include:

 Review of the facility policy ""Transfer/Receiving Patients According to COBRA"" revealed ""Every person presenting to the Emergency Department shall receive an appropriate medical screening examination.  This examination must be sufficient to determine if the person has an emergency medical condition.""  Review of the facility policy ""EMTALA - Emergency Medical Treatment"" revealed ""the initial medical screening examination must be conducted by qualified medical personnel to determine with reasonable confidence whether an emergency medical condition exists.

An emergency medical condition is a condition whose acute symptoms are severe enough that without immediate medical attention, it is expected to jeopardize the health of the individual, seriously impair bodily function, or cause serious dysfunction of any organ or body part.  Symptoms include pain, psychiatric disturbances, and substance abuse."" 

A review of the medical staff rules and regulations revealed the ""EMTALA  related medical screening examination"" could be performed by the following:  The ED Physicians, the ED Physician's Assistants, and the ED Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners.  Additionally, the obstetric nurses were authorized to perform the medical screening examination for pregnant patients at 20 weeks or greater gestation. 

A video of Patient #1 taken on 03/19/11 in the Emergency Department (ED) was provided by the facility for surveyor review.  Review of the video revealed it did not contain audio nor was there the ability to know what  time events took place.  There was a minute and second counter on the video.  The video encompassed the entire time Patient #1 was in the ED.  Observations of the video revealed the following:  Patient #1 entered the behavioral health room in the ED and sat down on the end of the stretcher.  Patient #1's hands were cuffed and his/her legs were shackled. Outside of the room was a Deputy Jailor and a facility Security Officer.  ED staff entered the room and obtained vital signs.  Patient #1 could be observed with his/her mouth moving.  ED nursing staff performed a nursing assessment.  An ED Nurse Technician was present in the room with Patient #1 when Patient #1 came to a standing position and lunged toward the female staff.  A facility Security Officer intervened.  Patient #1's mouth was continually moving.  Patient #1's assigned ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was observed for 36 seconds in the hall area outside of Patient #1's ED room.  During the 36 seconds ED Physician #2 was talking with the Deputy Jailor in the hallway (not looking in the room where Patient #1 was located), then moved into the doorway where Patient #1 could be viewed for 4 seconds, and then he left the area.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  Three ED nursing staff and a Security Officer entered Patient #1's room.  Patient #1 stood up, leaned over the stretcher, and permitted the staff to administer two injections of medications in the buttocks area.  Another ED physician (Physician #1), who was not treating or involved in Patient #1's care, entered Patient #1's room, 1.5 minutes after the medications were administered.  ED Physician #1 was observed rushing into the room and making statements to Patient #1, while raising his arm and pointing his finger at Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 started to leave the room when Patient #1 said something.  Physician #1 abruptly turned around and went back toward Patient #1.  ED Physician #1 placed his left hand on Patient #1's neck and upper chest area and pushed Patient #1 down on the stretcher.  ED Physician #1 left Patient #1's ED room and did not return while Patient #1 was in the ED.  Later after Patient #1 calmed down and was lying quietly on the stretcher, ED Physician #2 (attending physician) came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room and looked into the room for 5 to 6 seconds and walked off.  There was no conversation between Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  ED Physician #2 did not come to the doorway or enter Patient #1's room at any other time while Patient #1 was in the ED.  A meal tray was served to Patient #1.  Patient #1 was calm and consumed his/her meal tray without any further incidents.  Patient #1 was observed calmly walking out of the ED accompanied by the Deputy Jailor.     

A review of the history of Patient #1's visits to the facility's ED and admissions to the facility revealed Patient #1 had been admitted     to the facility's psychiatric unit on 03/23/09 through 04/01/09 with the diagnosis of ""Psychosis.""  Patient #1 had been experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices).

A review of Patient #1's ED medical record for 03/19/11 revealed he/she presented to the ED at 1437 accompanied by the police (from jail).  The police had a ""Uniform Citation"" that was presented to the facility which charged Patient #1 with ""Arrest, person is mentally ill and a danger to self and others.""  Patient #1 was brought to the facility ED by order of the County Attorney.  Review of the ""Focused Nursing Assessment"" revealed Patient #1 was agitated and cursing loudly.  His/Her face was red from pepper spray.  Patient #1 stated his/her skin was burning from the pepper spray.  Review of Physician #2's documentation revealed Patient #1 was ""very angry, combative, cursing, and yelling.""  Additionally,  ED Physician #2 documented that Patient #1 was  uncooperative for an exam, hostile, unable to determine orientation, normal motor and sensory response, normal inspection of neck and back, no respiratory distress, normal skin color, no rash, no signs of injury to the extremities.  ED Physician #2 documented Patient #1 was on a 72 hour emergency hold due to danger to self and potentially violent.  Patient #1's past history was ""bipolar disorder.""  The clinical impression was ""agitation"" and the physician documented that he counseled Patient #1 on the diagnosis and need for follow-up.  Review of the Medication Administration Record revealed that on 03/19/11 at 1450 Patient #1 received Geodon 20 mg intramuscular (IM) and Ativan 2 mg IM.  A fingerstick blood sugar was performed but no laboratory work or x-rays were ordered.  Patient #1 was discharged    from the ED on 03/19/11 at 1547 to police custody.  ED nursing staff documented Patient #1 was ""more calm"" at the time of discharge.  There was no documentation in the medical record by ED Physician #1.

An interview with ED Physician #1 on 03/29/11 at 2:15 PM, revealed he did not perform a medical screening on Patient #1 on 03/19/11; he was only intervening with Patient #1's disruptive behavior.

A tour of the ED on 03/29/11 at 3:30 PM revealed there was a patient in the behavior health ED room.  When standing in the hallway the patient could not be observed inside of the behavioral health ED room.  Located at the nurse's station was the monitor screen for the behavioral health room.  The picture was black and white. There was no ability to view any specifics about a patient such as skin color or the condition of the skin or the body.  

An interview with ED Physician #2 on 03/29/11 at 3:35 PM, revealed the medical screening was ""primarily a mental evaluation.""  He stated he did not review any of Patient #1's previous ED and/or hospital admissions.  He stated initially there was no conversation with Patient #1 because it was ""obviously pointless.""  He stated he could not ask Patient #1 any questions or do a formal evaluation.  After the medication was administered and Patient #1 began calming down, he stated he looked in on Patient #1 but did not examine the patient.  ED Physician #2 stated he felt Patient #1 was oriented and coherent.  He stated that usually the ED Physician would screen a patient and then they would call behavioral health if the patient might need to be admitted    .  He felt Patient #1 was ""clearly not suicidal.""  He stated he did not call Behavioral Health to assess because he felt that Patient #1 knew what he/she was saying.  Additionally, if Patient #1 had not been in custody, he felt it might have been different because Patient #1 could not do anything in jail.  ED Physician #2 stated he could hear Patient #1 from the hallway and other areas of the ED.  

An interview with the Deputy Jailor on 03/30/11 at 11:45 AM, revealed Patient #1 was brought to the ED on 03/19/11 because he/she had been throwing food in the jail, washing his/her hair with toilet water, not sleeping, acting bizarre, talking out of his/her head making statements about being pregnant with twins, and talking about the devil.  Jail personnel had been instructed by the County Attorney to take Patient #1 to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.  On the ride to the hospital, Patient #1 was saying he/she was pregnant with twins and screaming and then would get quiet.  The Deputy Jailor stated he did not observe the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) go into the room and examine or talk to Patient #1 anytime during the ED visit.  After returning to the jail Patient #1 slept through the night.  The next day Patient #1's behavior began escalating again.  After the effects of the medication, that was administered in the ED, wore off Patient #1 began screaming out and talking about being pregnant.  Patient #1 required tazing on 03/20/11 due to his/her behavior.  On 03/21/11 Patient #1 was evaluated by a Mental Health Professional and Patient #1 was sent to a psychiatric hospital for admission.

An interview with the President of the contracted group of ED Physicians on 03/30/11 at 3:00 PM, revealed his typical emergency medical screening on a patient presenting with problems such as Patient #1, would include obtaining lab work, request Behavioral Health to evaluate, and then make a decision on the disposition of the patient.

An interview was conducted on 03/31/11 at 1:30 PM, with the Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, who was on-call on 03/19/11.  She revealed she was not called to assess Patient #1 in the ED on 03/19/11. 

An interview with the Chief of Staff of the ED on 03/31/11 at 2:05 PM, revealed every physician had a different routine of performing a medical screening of a patient with agitated behavior.  He stated he would get information from the police and try to interview the patient.  He usually obtained lab work to medically clear the patient and then got a psychiatric evaluation from Behavioral Health. 

A review of the ""History (Psychiatric-Medical Evaluation)"" from the admitting psychiatric facility revealed  Patient #1 was admitted     as an inpatient on 03/21/11.  The evaluation revealed Patient #1 was ""exhibiting volatile behavior"" and alternating between laughing inappropriately and crying.  Patient #1 believed he/she was pregnant with twins and the father was a celebrity.  Patient #1 was threatening and head banging causing severe bruising and black eyes.  He/She was very agitated, psychotic, and manic.  The patient had a history of ""Bipolar 1 Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features, and Personality Disorder NOS.""  The admitting diagnostic impression was ""Bipolar 1 disorder, most recent episode manic, severe with psychotic features, unspecified if mood-congruent psychotic features (principal).""

The facility failed to ensure an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted to determine if an emergency medical condition existed for Patient #1. Observations of the video the facility provided, record reviews and interviews revealed the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was at Patient #1's ED doorway on two occasions for a total of 9 to 10 seconds.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor an examination.  After Patient #1 had calmed down and was cooperative, ED Physician #2 still did not conduct a conversation or an examination of Patient #1 to determine the patient's mental status.  The failure to conduct an adequate medical screening resulted in Patient #1 being returned to the jail and he/she required tazing after the effects of the medication wore off.  Additionally, Patient #1 was admitted     to a psychiatric facility on 03/21/11 in a psychotic state and had sustained severe bruising and black eyes from head banging.  It was determined the facility's failure placed Patient #1 in imminent danger and at substantial risk of  death or serious physical harm.

 REVIEW OF THE FACILITY POLICY ""TRANSFER/RECEIVING PATIENTS ACCORDING TO COBRA"" REVEALED ""EVERY PERSON PRESENTING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SHALL RECEIVE AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION.  THIS EXAMINATION MUST BE SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE IF THE PERSON HAS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION.""  REVIEW OF THE FACILITY POLICY ""EMTALA - EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT"" REVEALED ""THE INITIAL MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION MUST BE CONDUCTED BY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO DETERMINE WITH REASONABLE CONFIDENCE WHETHER AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION EXISTS.  THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION SHOULD BE AN ONGOING PROCESS ACCOMPANIED BY A RECORD THAT REFLECTS CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THE PATIENT.  AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION IS A CONDITION WHOSE ACUTE SYMPTOMS ARE SEVERE ENOUGH THAT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION, IT IS EXPECTED TO JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL, SERIOUSLY IMPAIR BODILY FUNCTION, OR CAUSE SERIOUS DYSFUNCTION OF ANY ORGAN OR BODY PART.  SYMPTOMS INCLUDE PAIN, PSYCHIATRIC DISTURBANCES, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.""

Based on observations, interviews and record reviews, it was determined the facility failed to ensure that a patient presenting with an emergency medical condition, received an appropriate examination and treatment, that was within the capabilities of the facility, to stabilize a psychiatric condition for one patient (#1) in the selected sample of 21.

Findings include:

A video of Patient #1 taken on 03/19/11 in the Emergency Department (ED) was provided by the facility for surveyor review.  The video encompassed the entire time Patient #1 was in the ED.  Observations of the video revealed the following:  Patient #1 entered the behavioral health room in the ED and sat down on the end of the stretcher.  Patient #1's hands were cuffed and his/her legs were shackled.  ED staff entered the room and obtained vital signs.  Patient #1 could be observed with his/her mouth moving.  ED nursing staff performed a nursing assessment.  An ED Nurse Technician was present in the room with Patient #1 when Patient #1 came to a standing position and lunged toward the female staff.  A facility Security Officer intervened.  Patient #1's mouth was continually moving.  Patient #1's assigned ED Physician (ED Physician #2) was observed for 36 seconds in the hall area outside of Patient #1's ED room.  During the 36 seconds ED Physician #2 was talking with the Deputy Jailor in the hallway (not looking in the room where Patient #1 was located), then moved into the doorway where Patient #1 could be viewed for 4 seconds, and then he left the area.  There was no conversation between ED Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  Three ED nursing staff and a Security Officer entered Patient #1's room.  Patient #1 stood up, leaned over the stretcher, and permitted the staff to administer two injections of medications in the buttocks area.  Later after Patient #1 calmed down and was lying quietly on the stretcher, ED Physician #2 (attending physician) came to the doorway of Patient #1's ED room and looked into the room for 5 to 6 seconds and walked off.  There was no conversation between Physician #2 and Patient #1 nor was an examination performed.  ED Physician #2 did not come to the doorway or enter Patient #1's room at any other time while Patient #1 was in the ED.  A meal tray was served to Patient #1.  Patient #1 was calm and consumed his/her meal without any further incidents.  Patient #1 was observed calmly walking out of the ED accompanied by the Deputy Jailor.     

A review of Patient #1's ED medical record for 03/19/11 revealed he/she presented to the ED at 1437 accompanied by the police (from jail).  The police had a ""Uniform Citation"" that was presented to the facility which charged Patient #1 with ""Arrest, person is mentally ill and a danger to self and others.""  Patient #1 was brought to the facility ED by order of the County Attorney.  Review of the ""Focused Nursing Assessment"" revealed Patient #1 was agitated and cursing loudly.  His/Her face was red from pepper spray.  Patient #1 stated his/her skin was burning from the pepper spray.  Review of Physician #2's documentation revealed Patient #1 was ""very angry, combative, cursing, and yelling.""  Additionally,  ED Physician #2 documented that Patient #1 was  uncooperative for an exam, hostile, unable to determine orientation, normal motor and sensory response, normal inspection of neck and back, no respiratory distress, normal skin color, no rash, no signs of injury to the extremities.  ED Physician #2 documented Patient #1 was on a 72 hour emergency hold due to danger to self and potentially violent.  Patient #1's past history was ""bipolar disorder.""  The clinical impression was ""agitation"" and the physician documented that he counseled Patient #1 on the diagnosis and need for follow-up.  Review of the Medication Administration Record revealed that on 03/19/11 at 1450 Patient #1 received Geodon 20 mg intramuscular (IM) and Ativan 2 mg IM.  A fingerstick blood sugar was performed but no laboratory work or x-rays were ordered.  Patient #1 was discharged    from the ED on 03/19/11 at 1547 to police custody.  ED nursing staff documented Patient #1 was ""more calm"" at the time of discharge.  There was no documentation in the medical record by ED Physician #1.

An interview with ED Physician #1 on 03/29/11 at 2:15 PM, revealed he did not perform a medical screening on Patient #1 on 03/19/11; he was only intervening with Patient #1's disruptive behavior.

An interview with ED Physician #2 on 03/29/11 at 3:35 PM, revealed the medical screening was ""primarily a mental evaluation.""  He stated he did not review any of Patient #1's previous ED and/or hospital admissions.  He stated initially there was no conversation with Patient #1 because it was ""obviously pointless.""  He stated he could not ask Patient #1 any questions or do a formal evaluation.  After the medication was administered and Patient #1 began calming down, he stated he looked in on Patient #1 but did not examine the patient.  ED Physician #2 stated he felt Patient #1 was oriented and coherent.  He stated that usually the ED Physician would screen a patient and then they would call behavioral health if the patient might need to be admitted    .  He felt Patient #1 was ""clearly not suicidal.""  He stated he did not call Behavioral Health to assess because he felt that Patient #1 knew what he/she was saying.  Additionally, if Patient #1 had not been in custody, he felt it might have been different because Patient #1 could not do anything in jail.  ED Physician #2 stated he could hear Patient #1 from the hallway and other areas of the ED.  

An interview was conducted on 03/31/11 at 1:30 PM, with the Behavioral Health Registered Nurse, who was on-call on 03/19/11.  She revealed she was not called to assess Patient #1 in the ED on 03/19/11. 

An interview with the Deputy Jailor on 03/30/11 at 11:45 AM, revealed Patient #1 was brought to the ED on 03/19/11 because he/she had been throwing food in the jail, washing his/her hair with toilet water, not sleeping, acting bizarre, talking out of his/her head making statements about being pregnant with twins, and talking about the devil.  Jail personnel had been instructed by the County Attorney to take Patient #1 to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.  On the ride to the hospital, Patient #1 was saying he/she was pregnant with twins and screaming and then would get quiet.  The Deputy Jailor stated he did not observe the attending ED Physician (ED Physician #2) go into the room and examine or talk to Patient #1 anytime during the ED visit.  After returning to the jail Patient #1 slept through the night.  The next day Patient #1's behavior began escalating again.  After the effects of the medication, that was administered in the ED, wore off Patient #1 began screaming out and talking about being pregnant.  Patient #1 required tazing on 03/20/11 due to his/her behavior.  On 03/21/11 Patient #1 was evaluated by a Mental Health Professional and Patient #1 was sent to a psychiatric hospital for admission.

The facility failed to provide further psychiatric examination, treatment, and stabilization for Patient #1 on 03/19/11.  Although, the facility had available a Behavioral Health Access team they were not contacted to evaluate Patient #1.  Patient #1 was administered antipsychotic medications and after calming down no further psychiatric evaluation was conducted or arranged for.  There was no definitive psychiatric follow-up arranged, prior to discharging Patient #1 back to jail.

Interviews revealed Patient #1 presented to the L&D on 09/11/16 with a complaint of active labor.  Patient #1 was taken to a room and provided with a medical screening by Registered Nurse (RN) #1 and informed she was dilated to one (1) centimeter.  Patient #1's family member stated RN #1 informed her that the patient's Obstetrician (OB) (Physician #1) did not deliver at Facility #1 and RN #1 would contact the OB on call (Physician #2).  Physician #2 did not return RN #1's calls and Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) #1 was contacted.  APRN #1 gave RN #1 an order to ""discharge [Patient #1] to [Facility #2]"" (23 miles away) where Physician #1 would deliver the baby.  At approximately 11:15 AM, RN #3 assessed Patient #1 and found the patient to be ""dilated to 3.""  RN #1 and RN #3 failed to contact APRN #1 with the change in Patient #1's condition.  Patient #1 left Facility #1 in a privately owned vehicle and arrived at Facility #2 at 12:14 PM.  Patient #1 delivered by Caesarean section at 1:38 PM due to fetal intolerance of labor.

Based on interview, record review, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to comply with 42 CFR 489.24 Special Responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases for two (2) of twenty-one (21) patients that presented to the facility extension Emergency Department (ED), Patients #1 and #20.  The facility extension failed to ensure a medical screening examination (MSE) was provided for Patient #1 on 01/12/13 after he/she was brought to their ambulance bay for treatment of a possible emergency medical condition. The facility extension failed to ensure an appropriate transfer was accomplished on 07/30/12 for Patient #20 when he/she was transferred to an external psychiatric facility. 

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who will investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.  Additionally, the policy revealed patients transferred to an external psychiatric facility must have a transfer form completed by the Physician, Social Worker (if applicable), and Nurse.  The policy further revealed the patient must be medically and psychiatrically stable before being transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  It stated the attending Physician, in consultation with the Psychiatrist would prepare a referral with the signature of the consulting Psychiatrist, and if the patient was seen on an emergent basis, the ED records would be copied and  transferred with the patient.  It further revealed the Physician would determine the appropriate mode of transport, the supervision required, and the patient's medical condition, and in the ED, the nursing staff would arrange for the transport.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting,"" policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

1. Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Observation of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.  

2.  Review of Patient #20's ED record revealed he/she arrived at the facility extension ED on 07/30/12 at 2:51 AM with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made and was escorted by law enforcement.  The Physician ED note listed unremarkable vital signs and negative/noncontributory review of systems.  It also listed a Psychiatric consult was done, a urine drug screen was presumptively positive, and the patient had an appropriate mood and behavior.  Patient #20 was transferred to an external psychiatric facility.  There was no documentation the receiving psychiatric facility had agreed to accept the transfer, had been sent the required hospital records, or that the patient had been transported appropriately and safely to the receiving psychiatric facility. The record revealed there was no facility transfer form.

Interview with the Enterprise ED Director and the facility RN ED Manager, on 01/31/13 at 4:25 PM, revealed both stated the facility extension ED had not been completing transfer forms that had required information for ED patients transferred to an external facility since 2010 when personnel were told they did not have to complete the transfer forms for an intra-facility transfer, (transfer from the facility to the facility extension.)  They both stated, at this point, the staff stopped completing any transfer forms for any patients, no matter where they were being transferred.  They further revealed the problem was discovered during an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Validation Survey conducted 01/14/13 through 01/18/13 and since the problem was identified, the facility had started completing transfer forms (one to go with patient and one to stay in ED record)  for patients transferred outside the facility system.

Confirmation of the facility extension completing a transfer form was accomplished by review of a closed ED record, Patient #9, which revealed he/she was seen in the facility extension ED on 01/27/13 with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation with no attempt made.  The record revealed this patient was transferred on 01/27/13 to an external psychiatric facility.  The record also revealed it contained a ""Transfer Agreement"" that listed the medical condition of the patient, the reason for transfer, the approval of the receiving facility for transfer, the Physician accepting transfer, who received the patient report at the receiving facility, the transfer method, and treatment information.  This form must be signed by the Discharging Nurse.  This form also has a section for transfer of unstable patients with the required Physician completion and signature.

CONFIRMATION OF THE FACILITY EXTENSION COMPLETING A TRANSFER FORM WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY REVIEW OF A CLOSED ED RECORD, PATIENT #9, WHICH REVEALED HE/SHE WAS SEEN IN THE FACILITY EXTENSION ED ON 01/27/13 WITH A CHIEF COMPLAINT OF SUICIDAL IDEATION WITH NO ATTEMPT MADE.  THE RECORD REVEALED THIS PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED ON 01/27/13 TO AN EXTERNAL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.  THE RECORD ALSO REVEALED IT CONTAINED A ""TRANSFER AGREEMENT"" THAT LISTED THE MEDICAL CONDITION OF THE PATIENT, THE REASON FOR TRANSFER, THE APPROVAL OF THE RECEIVING FACILITY FOR TRANSFER, THE PHYSICIAN ACCEPTING TRANSFER, WHO RECEIVED THE PATIENT REPORT AT THE RECEIVING FACILITY, THE TRANSFER METHOD, AND TREATMENT INFORMATION.  THIS FORM MUST BE SIGNED BY THE DISCHARGING NURSE.  THIS FORM ALSO HAS A SECTION FOR TRANSFER OF UNSTABLE PATIENTS WITH THE REQUIRED PHYSICIAN COMPLETION AND SIGNATURE.

Based on interview, record review, document review, and review of facility policies and procedures, it was determined the facility failed to ensure one (1) of twenty-one (21) patients selected for review and who had presented to the facility extension's Emergency Department (ED) seeking medical care received a medical screening examination (MSE), Patient #1.  A review of documentation in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance transport records revealed Patient #1 arrived at the facility extension ED ambulance bay on 01/12/13 at 7:58 PM and left per ambulance for the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM without disembarking from the ambulance or receiving a MSE because  facility extension ED personnel would not let Patient #1 enter the ED.

The findings include:

Review of the facility policy, ""Emergent Care and Emergency Response to Medical Emergencies,"" policy number A02-055, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed the facility recognized its responsibility to provide an appropriate MSE to any individual who came to the ED.  In addition, the facility defined ""came to the ED"" to include any individual who was in a ground ambulance on the facility hospital property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical condition at either the main facility ED or the facility extension ED. The policy also revealed the facility would maintain a central log of individuals who came to the ED seeking treatment, indicating whether these individuals refused treatment; were denied treatment; were treated, admitted    , stabilized, and/or transferred or were discharged   ; or the individual (or person acting on his or her behalf) after being informed of the risks and the facility's obligations, requested a transfer.

Review of the facility policy, ""Transfer of Patients,"" policy number A02-015, effective date 10/2008, revealed patients shall be transferred, both internally and to external facilities, in accordance with EMTALA regulations.  It further revealed transfers within all facility units were based on medical necessity, such as the need for specialized care only available at another unit.  The policy also stated the facility was required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the receipt of an individual who had been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another hospital in violation of the Special Responsibilities of Medicare Hospitals in Emergency Cases set forth in the regulations promulgated under EMTALA.  In addition, any facility staff member who believed a patient had been so transferred must report the circumstances to the Compliance Officer immediately, who would investigate the matter and file the report with CMS, if appropriate.

Review of facility policy, ""Nursing Triage Process in the Emergency Department,"" policy number ED08-80, review/revision date 03/2012, revealed presenting ED patients were prioritized for evaluation according to acuteness of conditions using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) criteria as follows: acuity 1, Critical; acuity 2, Emergent; acuity 3, Urgent; acuity 4, Stable; and acuity 5, Office or Clinic type care needed.

Review of facility policy, ""Control of Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) Virus in Patient Care Setting"", policy number A03-020, review/revision date 08/2011, revealed in all cases of herpes zoster (shingles) standard infection control precautions shall be followed.  It further revealed if the patient is immunocompetent with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions would be followed and any lesions completely covered; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.  The policy also stated for immunocompromised patients with localized herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until disseminated infection was ruled out, then standard precautions until lesions were dry and crusted; if this patient had disseminated herpes zoster, standard precautions plus airborne and contact precautions would be followed until lesions were dry and crusted.

Review of the facility, ""Medical Staff Bylaws,"" amended and restated 12/10/12, revealed in Section 5.6, Medical Screening, Physician Assistants (PA) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) who are members of the Health Professional Staff, to the extent permitted by state and federal law and consistent with clinical privileges granted and facility policy, perform and document MSE's required under 42 CFR 489.24 (a)(1)(i), under the direction of the Chair of Emergency Medicine and subject to supervision of an Active Medical Staff member.

Review of the ED Contract Agency's Emergency Medical Services Agreement, signed by the facility on 07/25/12, revealed Section 1, 2.1 (c) stated the contractor shall provide any services contemplated in this Agreement in compliance with EMTALA and the regulations and standards promulgating thereunder.  It further revealed the Contractor and Covering Providers shall participate in any facility training or information programs regarding compliance with EMTALA and shall adhere to all facility rules, regulations, standards, policies or procedures relating to compliance with EMTALA. 

Review (listening) of  the audio tape, on 01/31/13 at 1:25 PM, from the EMS dispatch of 01/12/13 en route to the facility extension ED with Patient #1 on board revealed the Facility Dispatcher called the facility extension ED and spoke with the ED Charge Nurse informing her of a patient en route with lethargy and possible shingles.  The audio tape further revealed Patient #1's blood pressure (BP) was 72/50; heart rate was 120; and he/she had received three hundred (300) milliliters (ml) of an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus.  EMS stated they would arrive in about ten (10) minutes.  Then, the audio tape revealed the ED Charge Nurse told the Facility Dispatcher there were two (2) pregnant practitioners working in the facility extension ED, and neither could see the patient.  The ED Charge Nurse stated the Physician working in the ED on 01/12/13 (ED MD) wanted Patient #1 to be diverted to the main facility ED.  Then, the Facility Dispatcher told the ED Charge Nurse she would see what she could do.  Nothing else was on the audio tape.  

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  068, revealed EMS received a call concerning this patient on 01/12/13 at 7:17 PM with the chief complaint being that Patient #1 had fainted and was unconscious.  The EMS record stated Patient #1 was lethargic with family reporting he/she had not had any fluids to drink over the last twenty-four (24) hour period.  The family also stated Patient #1 had been a patient at the facility extension earlier in the week and had been diagnosed    and treated for shingles.  The record further revealed the family requested Patient #1 be transported to the facility extension ED.  In addition, the record showed EMS personnel gave Patient #1 a five hundred (500) ml IV bolus of normal saline solution.  After this initial treatment, EMS reported Patient #1 showed improvement in mental status, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a change from sinus tachycardia (heart rate over one hundred (100) beats per minute) to sinus rhythm.  Next, the EMS report stated a call was made to the facility extension ED, and the transport was completed at 7:58 PM.  The EMS report further revealed at this time, the Facility Dispatcher told EMS not to take Patient #1 into the ED.  It further stated after three (3) to four (4) minutes EMS was told by dispatch to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED but was met by a nurse that told the Paramedic EMS could not enter until it was sorted out by the facility extension where Patient #1 would go.  The report stated this scenario happened multiple times.  The report further revealed EMS was told to take Patient #1 to the main facility ED at 8:21 PM. 

Review of Patient #1's EMS ambulance transport record, incident number  076, revealed EMS received a dispatch from the facility to transport Patient #1 from the facility extension ED overhang to the main facility ED on 01/12/13 at 8:21 PM and reached the main facility ED at 8:30 PM.  The chief complaint of Patient #1 was listed as lethargy and dehydration.  The report listed vital signs at 8:29 PM as blood pressure (BP) 91/41; heart rate 102, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% with oxygen, blood sugar 162, and Glasgow coma scale 15.  The report also stated IV fluid administration had continued, Patient #1 reported feeling much better, and his/her ability to communicate had improved.

Review of Patient #1's ED record from the main facility ED revealed he/she arrived on 01/12/13 at 8:38 PM.  Triage time was 8:39 PM.  Patient #1 was assigned an acuity level of two (2), Emergent.  Vital signs were BP 67/34, heart rate 99, oxygen saturation 97% on two (2) liters of oxygen per minute via nasal cannula.  The ED Interim Summary Note described an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]tous squama papular rash over the patient's left forehead and stated the patient was recently diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  ED treatment included IV fluid boluses (two (2) liters of Lactated Ringers); IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin 750 milligrams and Piperacillin 3.375 grams); stat ECG and chest x-ray; and stat lab work (hemogram with differential, complete metabolic profile, blood cultures, and catheterized urinalysis with culture).  The record further revealed lab results as follows: white blood count 14.2 (normal 4.0 to 10.5); white blood count [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]s 89% (normal 42 to 74%); hemoglobin 10.9 (normal 11.9 to 15.5); hematocrit 31.0%  (normal 35.0 to 45.0%); blood urea nitrogen 44 (normal 8-23); creatinine 2.86 (normal 0.60 to 1.10); sodium 122 (normal 136 to 145); and chloride 87 (normal 101 to 108).  The record further revealed, in the Discharge Summary Note, Patient #1's condition improved with continued treatment including a fourteen (14) day course of Acyclovir for shingles (rash was resolving well at time of discharge), and he/she was discharged    from acute care to a rehabilitation facility on 01/21/13. 

Review of the ED Log at the facility extension, on 01/30/13, revealed there was no entry for Patient #1 on 01/12/13, and no medical record of that event could be produced by the facility extension.

Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension), on 01/30/12 at 11:30 AM, revealed for backup of Physician coverage in the ED, hospitalists in the facility extension were called.  He also stated he lived near the facility extension and could be there quickly if needed.  Interview with the Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) per telephone, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM, revealed he did not learn of the 01/12/13 incident involving Patient #1 until 01/13/13.  The ED MD did not call him and request assistance during this incident.  He further revealed universal precautions are used for every patient because the ED practitioner may not know what communicable diseases a patient had; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be worn and isolation procedures instituted on a case by case basis.  The Medical Director of the ED (facility extension) also stated he had been trained in EMTALA guidelines and used to do the ED schedule for providers, but now the contract agency does the scheduling.

Interview with the ED Contract Agency Compliance and Legal Officer, on 01/31/13 at 3:15 PM per telephone, revealed the agency had provided EMTALA training for its practitioners in 07/2012 and 09/2012.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the Physician Assistant (PA) working in the facility extension ED on 01/12/13 during the incident with Patient #1 (ED PA) had received EMTALA training.  Also, she stated, since the incident on 01/12/13, the agency had sent out an e-mail to all practitioners regarding the need to take a refresher course on EMTALA; but, as of yet, no training had been conducted.  She further revealed the agency had policies and procedures on EMTALA and the ED MD would be placed on code of conduct probation.

Interview, on 01/30/13 at 1:45 PM, with the Paramedic who transported Patient #1 to the facility extension ED and the main facility ED on 01/12/13, revealed he agreed with everything in the EMS ambulance transport reports, number  068 and number  076.  He revealed Patient #1's son had told him the patient could have shingles; his/her Physician was not sure but was treating Patient #1 for shingles.  The Paramedic stated when he arrived at the facility extension ambulance bay, he received a call from the Facility Dispatcher telling him not to take Patient #1 into the facility extension ED.  He then received a call telling him to take the patient into the ED at the facility extension.  He further revealed this was about to happen for the third time, when he received a call to transport Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  He stated the reason given to him for not allowing Patient #1 into the facility extension ED was because both practitioners, the  ED MD and the ED PA, were pregnant and did not want to expose their fetuses to shingles.  The Paramedic further stated the ambulance with Patient #1 sat in the ambulance bay for more than twenty-one (21) minutes with the facility extension's staff members refusing to allow Patient #1 to enter the facility extension ED.  In addition, he stated he asked the facility extension's ED staff members to sign the ambulance trip form, but each refused.

Interview with ED Registered Nurse (RN) #1, on 01/30/13 at 4:15 PM, revealed the process for receiving ED patients via EMS was for EMS to call the Facility Dispatcher who then called the facility extension ED.  When EMS was en route, a brief report was called to the facility extension ED.  RN #1 further revealed personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available and was stocked by Central Supply every morning.  She also stated patients were given a mask if contagious, and ED Room #2 was a negative pressure room.  She revealed with using proper PPE, the ED should be able to care for any patient.  She further stated she knew of no patients with communicable diseases that had presented to the ED that were not seen.  

Interview with the facility extension ED Nurse Manager, on 01/31/13 at 9:20 AM, revealed the facility extension ED was not on diversion the night of 01/12/13, PPE was available, and treating patients with shingles or chicken pox was in the facility extension ED's scope of practice.  She verified that at the time of the incident with Patient #1, the ED MD and the ED PA were working and were both pregnant.  The ED Nurse Manager revealed she received a call from the ED Charge Nurse the next day, 01/13/13, who reported the incident with Patient #1 arriving for treatment but being diverted to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager reported the facility extension ED Charge Nurse stated she took a call from the the facility dispatch office that a patient was en route via EMS with shingles; the ED MD overheard the call and told the ED Charge Nurse to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED because neither of the practitioners wanted the exposure; the ED Charge Nurse tried to call the facility dispatch office, but the ambulance had already arrived in the ambulance bay; the ED Charge Nurse stated she went outside to tell EMS to hold on entering because the patient was going to be diverted to the main facility ED; while the patient was waiting in the ambulance, the facility ED nurse told EMS to take the patient inside the facility extension ED; then, the ED MD had called a facility ED Physician that agreed to accept Patient #1.  So, Patient #1 was transported to the main facility ED.  The ED Nurse Manager further revealed the hospitalist was called to come to the ED and examine Patient #1, but he was not able to leave patient care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  She further revealed, the ED practitioners at the facility extension were contract employees, and the facility did not control the staffing, the contract agency did.  The ED Nurse Manager also stated after the incident, the leadership group viewed a webinar on EMTALA guidelines and were in the process of putting together educational materials for all staff.  She further revealed that all nurses had already received training and information on EMTALA.  

Interview with the Facility Dispatcher, on 01/31/13 at 1:40 PM, revealed she had taken a call from the facility extension ED Charge Nurse on 01/12/13, requesting Patient #1 be diverted to the main facility ED because of shingles.  She reported she contacted EMS, which stated the ambulance was pulling into the ED bay, so she told them not to enter because of the two (2) pregnant providers.  The Facility Dispatcher further revealed she spoke to the the facility ED Charge Nurse that told her to tell the facility extension ED to take the patient to their ED for treatment.  The Facility Dispatcher further stated the facility extension ED did not answer the call, so she called EMS and told the Paramedic it was okay to take Patient #1 into the ED.  EMS replied with a 10-4 copy.  The Facility Dispatcher stated, about six (6) to eight (8) minutes later, EMS personnel called her back and stated the ambulance was still in the ED bay because the facility extension ED Charge Nurse came outside and stated Patient #1 could not go inside.  She also stated, about twenty (20) minutes later,  EMS called her and stated they were en route to the main facility ED.  The Facility Dispatcher revealed the EMS Paramedic was very upset.

Interview with the facility ED Physician, on 01/31/13 at 1:50 PM via telephone, revealed she received a call from the facility extension ED MD to see if she would accept Patient #1 because both providers were pregnant and an OB Chief Resident had given them an instruction that neither should see or care for Patient #1.   The facility ED Physician stated the ED MD had tried to consult with infectious disease without success.  The facility ED Physician agreed to accept Patient #1 at the main facility ED.  She further revealed she did not know Patient #1 was already at the facility extension ED.  

Interview with the facility Chief Compliance Officer, on 01/31/13 at 2:00 PM, revealed he had been contacted by the Enterprise ED Director on 01/14/13 because his office was responsible for investigating  possible EMTALA violations.  The primary concern was whether Patient #1 received the required MSE.  He further revealed there were some conflicting statements and could not validate that either the ED MD or the ED PA performed a MSE on Patient #1.  The Chief Compliance Officer further revealed  when employees start working, they are trained face-to-face and with computer modules on issues such as protected health information (PHI) and EMTALA.  He also stated the facility was not responsible for training ED contract agency personnel; however, he revealed ED contract employees were required to follow the facility's policies and procedures.  

Interview with the facility ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 2:20 PM, revealed she received a call from the facility dispatch office stating there was a patient with shingles at the facility extension ED, both providers were pregnant, and the ED MD wanted to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED.  She revealed she told the extension facility that the patient needed to be seen in their ED because the patient had requested to be seen at the facility extension.  She stated the next communication she heard was that Patient #1 was not allowed to enter the facility extension ED and was en route to the main facility ED.  She further revealed upon assessment of Patient #1, he/she had no open or crusted skin lesions but did have a reddened area on the left side of the face and forehead.  She reported Patient #1 was lethargic and hypotensive and was given IV fluid boluses within  the first five (5) minutes of arrival.  The facility ED Charge Nurse stated it took approximate four (4) liters of IV fluids to get Patient #1's systolic BP in the 90's over a four (4) hour period.  She stated Patient #1 was given the option of being admitted     to the facility extension; however, he/she was admitted     to the main facility because the family stated they were tired of Patient #1 being shuffled around.  The facility ED Charge Nurse also revealed the Paramedic stated Patient #1's family had requested to go to the facility extension ED, but the facility extension ED Charge Nurse had met them outside and would not let EMS enter the ED.  The Paramedic also revealed he had attempted to unload Patient #1 two (2) to three (3) times and was stopped by the facility extension ED personnel.     

Interview with Patient #1's son by telephone, on 01/31/13 at 2:35 PM, revealed the incident with Patient #1 seemed to last thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.  He stated Patient #1 was somewhat confused because of the dehydration and did not seem to know what was happening.  He further revealed he thought the situation was kind of weird but was only concerned about Patient #1 receiving treatment.  He stated he was told the reason the patient could not enter the facility extension ED was because a nurse was pregnant and could not be around anyone with shingles.  He further revealed he was not aware of the ED MD coming out to see Patient #1.

Interview with the facility extension ED Charge Nurse, on 01/31/13 at 3:43 PM per telephone, revealed she was the ED Charge Nurse on the evening of 01/12/13.  She stated a radio patch was received about a patient en route with shingles.  Neither the ED MD or the ED PA stated they could care for this patient.  The ED Charge Nurse further stated she called the facility dispatch office and the District Charge Nurse (DCN) about the situation, and by then the ambulance had arrived.  She stated she asked EMS to wait to see if Patient #1 could be sent to the main facility ED.  The DCN then called and said the providers could see this patient, and she told both providers.  She further revealed both the ED MD and the ED PA stated they did not feel comfortable caring for Patient #1 because the OB Chief Resident at the facility stated they should not be exposed to this patient with shingles.  The ED Charge RN stated she notified the DCN of this, and thought the ED MD called a Physician at the main facility ED because Patient #1 was accepted there.  She revealed the ED MD talked with EMS personnel and wanted to know the condition of Patient #1.  She further revealed at one point the ED MD said to let Patient #1 come inside, put a mask on the patient, and the ED MD would also wear a mask.  The ED Charge Nurse further revealed by that time, Patient #1 had been accepted at the main facility ED, and she also stated the the ED MD never came out to see Patient #1 while he/she was in the ambulance at the ED entrance.  She also revealed, on 01/12/13, ED personnel had PPE and Infection Control protocols available, and since this incident, ED personnel had a meeting to review EMTALA, but so far, there had been no formal or specific education or training.

Interview with the ED PA, on 01/31/13 at 4:04 PM, revealed she was working as a provider on 01/12/13 when the ED received a patch from the facility dispatch office that Patient #1 was en route and had been diagnosed    with [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ED PA further revealed the OB Resident said it was not safe for either of the practitioners to see Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  She also stated she never went out to see the patient.  The ED PA further revealed the Medical Director  of the ED, facility extension, had instructed her there was no danger in taking care of a patient with shingles if PPE was used; and she stated she had received EMTALA training in the summer of 2012.

Interview with the ED MD, on 01/31/13 at 8:35 PM per telephone, revealed she was the Physician working in the facility extension ED the evening of 01/12/13 when the incident with Patient #1 occurred.  She stated the ED Charge Nurse took a communication from EMS that the ambulance was en route with a patient  with shingles that had experienced a syncopal episode at home and that had been treated earlier in the week at the facility extension.  She further revealed she called the OB Chief Resident because of her pregnancy and was told under no circumstances, even if wearing PPE, should she, or the ED PA, because of her pregnancy, care for this incoming patient.  She also stated she called the hospitalist, but he could not come to the ED because he was caring for a patient in the ICU that was critical and deteriorating, and she did not call the Medical Director of the ED.  The ED MD stated, at this point, an effort was made to divert Patient #1 to the main facility ED and was told there was no reason either practitioner could not care for this patient; however, she believed the OB Resident and did not want to expose either fetus to unnecessary risks.  She further revealed, by this time, the ambulance had arrived at the ED bay, and she went out to talk with the family/EMS personnel and observe Patient #1 through the ambulance windows, having no direct contact with the patient or going inside the ambulance.  The ED MD further stated from the information given to her by the family and the EMS personnel the patient was stabilizing with an increased BP and improved ability to communicate and interact.  She also revealed she called a Physician at the main facility ED who agreed to accept Patient #1.  The ED MD stated her main goal was for Patient #1 to be seen as quickly as possible, and under the circumstances, she stated she felt like the best option was for Patient #1 to be sent to the main facility ED.  She also revealed she believed she did the best she could do in performing a MSE in that she was told it was not safe for either practitioner to directly evaluate and treat Patient #1, even if wearing PPE.  The ED MD also stated she had received training in EMTALA prior to this incident and had been researching its requirements since then.

Interview with the Director of Enterprise Accreditation and Regulatory Compliance, on 01/31/13 at 4:30 PM, revealed the facility, in the ED Charge Nurse Meeting on 01/23/13, addressed EMTALA and produced a copy of the minutes which stated a MSE must be done even on active labor patients.  She also stated an outline was being developed for an EMTALA education offering for all hospital and medical personnel.  This educational offering was to be in 02/2013.

Based on interview and document review the facility failed to complete an appropriate medical screening exam for two (#1, #2) of 24 patients reviewed for treatment and medical screening presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) resulting in the potential to delay care and less than optimal patient outcomes. Findings include:

On 11/16/2021 at 1440 it was revealed a patient (#2) arrived to the ED on 10/19/2021 and had left the ED after being asked to wear a mask. 

On 11/17/2021 at 1245 an interview occurred with staff O, the patient access representative on 10/19/2021. Staff O was queried about patient #2 arriving at the ED for emergency services. Staff O stated the patient #2 refused to wear a mask in order to be seen in the ED. Staff O was asked why the patient (#2) had presented to the ED. Staff O stated that she remembered that the patient had stated that she was possibly pregnant and thought she might have been experiencing problems. Staff O was asked if the patient was triaged and if she had a medical screening exam. Staff O stated that since the patient was unwilling to comply with wearing a mask that the patient left the facility without being triaged or having a medical screening exam. Staff O was then queried if there was an alternative to wearing a mask for individuals presenting to the ED. Staff O stated, ""They can wear a face shield if they provide a doctor's note stating they could not wear a mask.""

Video requested from the ED for 10/19/2021 at 1730 to 1800 was provided. Document review of the video occurred on 11/17/2021 at 1500. During the document review of the video footage of 10/19/2021 at 1740 it was revealed patient #2 entered the facility and stopped at the greeter's station. Patient #2 was observed presenting to the registration area and conversing with someone behind the glass partition. The patient was then seen going back to the vestibule where the greeter's station is located and returning to the registration area. The patient (#2) was accompanied by two additional people (a male and a female). At 1743 the patient stood up and took her mask off, which was located below her nose and threw the mask in the garbage.

Mother informed me that the child appeared to be getting sicker instead of coming back to the emergency department she went to (Facility B) Medical Center (where) the child was diagnosed    with DKA (diabetic keto-acidosis). Is no family history of diabetes. Patient was not having any nausea vomiting for our visit. Nor was he having any significant urinary symptoms. The case had also been discussed with Dr. (Staff M) and she was apprised of the patient's up-to-date as well.""

Chief Complaint-Fatigue

History of Present Illness
""This [AGE]-year-old (8-year-old) child presents with mother. Mother is concerned because the child's been having fatigue for about the last week. She called her doctor yesterday and they told her they could see her by video appointment Friday. She has had no fever no cough no complaints of chest pain but the mother feels a CT scan of breathing a little harder than he normally does not wheezing no nausea vomiting not eating much but drinking no complaints of about pain or back pain sore throat no diarrhea no constipation no leg pain no rashes again plenty of fluids and urinating okay. The mother had Covid last Monday has been symptom free for last 4 days again the child's been sick for a week or little longer mother is not immunized against Covid. No complaints of headache neck pain blurry vision double vision balance or coordination issues.""

Medical Decision Making
""The child is fatigued but has no other complaints or symptoms and is hemodynamically stable. Covid test is performed. The mother is worried about his weight loss he does not seem to be excessively cachectic to me I told the mother that hydration right now is his primary the most important and that maybe she could supplement his water with some protein shakes or liquid nutrition. Case discussed with the pediatric hospitalist (Staff M) who recommended the same kind of things and did not recommend any specific particular testing or any other testing or any other recommendations.""
Diagnosis
Fatigue and weakness of uncertain etiology
Covid positivity

On 11/17/21 at 12:37 a phone interview was conducted with attending physician Staff N. Staff N was queried of his recollection of the encounter with Pt.#1, Staff N stated ""I did see them in Express Care. She was concerned that the child was sick."" Staff N was then queried if there was any indication for additional diagnostic testing, to which he replied ""My evaluation didn't reveal anything other than he was Covid positive. I received a phone call which recommends Pediatric consult, and no further lab testing."" Staff N was then questioned if the patient's mother appeared upset with the decision to forego further testing. Staff N stated ""I don't remember if she was upset. Yes, I do recall she wrote a complaint. We had discussed it. I called her two days later, so I called to check on how the child was doing, she took him to (Facility).""

On 11/17/21 at 1315 an interview was conducted with Staff Q, the ED registered nurse that provided care to patient #1. Staff Q was queried if she was aware that the parent of patient #1 who was present at the time of the ED visit had additional concerns prior to discharge. Staff Q replied, ""The child's mother did communicate that she wanted further testing at which time I did have a conversation with the provider."" Staff Q was then asked if any additional testing was ordered. Staff Q stated, ""No ...no additional testing was ordered.""

On 11/17/21 at 1400 a phone interview was conducted with the consulting Pediatric physician, (Staff M). Staff M was queried about the consultation, stating ""He called and wanted to discuss findings, which were otherwise stable. He felt he was stable."" Staff M was questioned if she had any recommendations for treatment, replying ""I didn't suggest any labs. I did remember asking about the pulse ox, he said it was fine."" Staff M was asked if it would be 'normal' to do lab studies in this particular case, to which she stated, ""No."" When asked if a Covid test would be 'normal' in this case, she stated, ""Yes."" Staff M was queried what would be the minimum workup for a Medical Screening Exam (MSE), Staff M replied, ""Pulse Ox, head-to-toe, Neuro's, Electrolytes. He was quote tired, so that doesn't raise it to another level.""

Based on staff interview, medical record review, and facility policy and procedure review the facility failed to provide necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition on 01/23/2022 during emergency department (ED) visit for one (1) of 20 patient charts reviewed:  Patient #1.

Findings Include:

A phone interview on 02/16/2022 at 10:55 a.m. with Patient #1 revealed she returned to the emergency department (ED) a third (3rd) time on 01/23/2022 with increased pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, and concerns of internal bleeding.  Patient #1 reported she only had lab work done and no other testing or examinations were performed, and she asked again about possible internal bleeding but was told to follow up with her Obstetrician /Gynecologist (OBGYN) the next day.  Patient #1 reported on 1/26/2022 that her pain became unbearable, so she went to a different hospital, Facility #2.  Patient #1 reported the physician told her, ""she was in bad shape and needed surgery.""   Patient #1 reported she had a six (6) centimeter (cm) blood clot in her fallopian tube from the [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and she had to have emergency surgery to remove the fallopian tube and clean out all the blood.  Patient #1 reported the physician told her she ""was messed up and could have died   ."" Patient #1 reported she was discharged    on [DATE] with a drain in her surgical site.  Patient #1 reported the physician was very concerned about the care she had received prior to coming to Facility #2.  Patient #1 reported she is very concerned and upset that no one ever actually checked her at her OBGYN clinic and that on her last visit on 01/23/2022 to Hospital #1 the physician in the ED refused to consult OBGYN and did not do a thorough examination, only lab work.  Patient stated, ""All of this could have been prevented if they would have just done their job.""  Patient #1 stated she did go to all her follow-up visits (12/30/21, 01/04/2022, 01/7/2022, 01/20/2022, 01/24/2022) with her OBGYN, but they only drew blood each time and she never saw a doctor.    

An interview on 02/16/2022 at 3:00 p.m. with ED Physician, Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) (on duty 01/23/2022 who treated Patient #1), revealed he felt like this wasn't an emergent situation for 01/23/2022 ED visit.  The ED Physician reported the patient was scheduled to be seen the next day 01/24/2022 by her OBGYN.  The ED Physician said the patient reported she had been followed closely by her OBGYN over the past month.  The ED Physician reported there is no protocol for low hemoglobin and hematocrit or [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] because they are treated per provider judgement.  The ED Physician stated, ""if there were all those protocols there would have been no need for me to go to medical school.""  The ED Physician reported the patient told him her pain was better than it was three (3) days prior to the ED visit.  The ED Physician reported he did not consult an obstetrician (OB) physician or order an ultrasound because nothing indicated she needed that.  The ED Physician reported her hemoglobin and hematocrit were low, but orthostatic blood pressures were normal which indicated no major blood loss.  

An interview on 02/17/2022 at 10:05 a.m. with Registered Nurse (RN) #1, confirmed she did not remember this patient, but reviewed the chart and the hemoglobin and hematocrit were not critical and her orthostatic blood pressures were normal at the 01/23/2022 ED visit.  RN #1 reported normally the patient would go to surgery if the [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] was diagnosed    in the ED, but the OBGYN was consulted and that they had decided to give the Methotrexate instead on the 12/27/2021 ED visit.

An interview on 02/17/2022 at 12:55 p.m. with the ED Director revealed he remembered giving the patient Methotrexate on 12/27/2021 ED visit because they don't do that very often.  The ED Director reported he has seen both surgical and medical treatment of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] with patients.  The ED Director reported, ""in this case the patient already had an appointment the next day,01/24/2022 and lab values weren't critical and vital signs were within normal limits, so she was referred to her Obstetrician for her follow-up the next day 01/24/2022.""

A medical record review of Patient #1's third (3rd) visit to the Emergency Department (ED) on 01/23/2022 revealed the patient arrived by private vehicle at 8:06 a.m. with complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness.  The patient's vital signs were obtained at 8:20 a.m. and were within normal limits.  The medical record review of the ED Physician's report revealed the patient complained of "" ...abdominal pain, lightheadedness, and concerns for the fact that she may be ""bleeding internally""  ...""  A review of the ED physician's assessment dated  [DATE] revealed the patient had abdominal tenderness to the left lower quadrant and to the right lower quadrant.  The medical record review revealed the ED Physician ordered labs as follows: complete blood count (CBC), HCG quantitative, orthostatic blood pressure's (B/P) and urinalysis (U/A) with culture if indicated.  A review of the medical record revealed that the patient's lab results were as follows: Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) has decreased from 4.32 on 12/27/2021 to 3.35 on 01/23/2022, Hemoglobin (Hgb) has decreased from 11.8 on 12/27/2021 to 9.2 on 01/23/2022, Hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 36.0 on 12/27/2021 to 27.9 on 01/23/2022, Platelets have increased from 303 on 12/27/2021 to 449 on 01/23/2022, and Human Chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) quantitative has decreased from 7408 on 12/27/2021 to 677.8 on 01/23/2022.  A review of the ED Physician's assessment revealed the physician discharged    Patient #1 to home and to follow up with her OBGYN the next day, 01/24/2022.  The medical record review revealed there was no documented evidence of an OBGYN consult made on this visit or a comparable ultrasound completed.  The medical record revealed the patient was discharged    at 10:23 a.m. with instructions to follow up with her specialist as scheduled and return if symptoms get worse. 

A review of the medical record obtained from Facility #2 revealed the patient went for evaluation on 01/27/2022 and was admitted on [DATE] with a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  

Review of the consultation note from 01/27/2022 revealed the patient had a ruptured left [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The surgical note review revealed the hematoma was evacuated, and the left fallopian tube was removed.  A medical record review of the discharge summary revealed the patient was discharged    home on 01/29/2022 with  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]].  
Review of facility policy entitled ""Emergency Department Triage Policy"" (Reviewed/Revised 9/28/2016) revealed "" ...URGENT ...3. A rule-out [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] when patient is hemodynamically stable ...13. If an emergency medical condition does exist: 13.1 ...treatment will be initiated as medically appropriate ...including all ancillary services ...to ensure that -13.1.1 The patient's condition is stabilized ..."".

During exit conference on 02/17/2022 at 4:00 p.m. with the Chief Executive officer, Chief Nursing Officer, Emergency Department/Intensive Care Director, Labor and Delivery Manager, and Human Resources Director survey findings were discussed and no further documentation was submitted for review.

In addition a total of 137 patients signed in to be seen and there were a total of 35 admissions for this day. We were two registered nurses (RNs) short on both the morning and evening shifts due to call-ins.  This was the Friday after Thanksgiving.

The Medical Director for the ED stated,  ""In November 2015, we lost all our Patient Care Representatives who helped in triage, due to budget cuts. The wait times were identified and were sent to the G7 committee.""   When asked what the G7 committee entailed, he replied,  ""It's a committee made up of the hospitals Vice Presidents. It is a 7 person committee which has to approve any spending of the facility due to the financial loss this facility has taken in the last year.""   The Director of Emergency Services stated that she does a chart audit of 30% (percent) every month and she did notice occasional extended wait times.   ""I came up with an action plan after a patient filed a complaint in February 2016.  I have done much research on AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), have spoken to other hospitals, and I presented a plan to the G7 committee on 05/07/2016 and it was approved.  The Pharmacy will now do all medications and four  Patient Care Technicians were approved to be hired.  The announcements were finalized and the jobs posted on 06/07/2016 and we've already had four applications.  The facility has revised their policies to address this issue, however the policies have not been approved as yet.""  When asked if they were aware if any of the facility staff has ever told the patients their wait time would be a couple of hours, the Director of Emergency Services stated that she does not believe her staff would ever do that.  ""However, as a courtesy, if the wait is going to be long, I ask the triage nurse, when she does the reassessment, to apologize to the patient and reassure them they will be seen. In addition, I have instructed them several times to never give a wait time.  All staff has been trained on this.""   The ED Director stated,  "" I would like to add that as of this morning there were eight patients left over for the morning shift to see, 27 scheduled surgeries, 10 patients in the cath lab and their floor census this morning is 180.""   He also stated that the facility has not been on diversion. During these interviews it was noted that the ED had an Alpha Code called, a Bravo Code called and a Code Brown called. The Brown Code was a gunshot that required extra security for the ED.

Triage is neither a diagnostic process nor a medical stability screen. A medical screening must be offered to every patient who presents for care...""

If any individual... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital should provide for an appropriate medical screening examination, performed by a qualified medical person, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.... Definitions:... B. Emergency Medical Condition: 1. A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, ...) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could  reasonably  be expected to result in either: a. Placing the health of an individual (or, with respect of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy. b. Serious impairment to bodily functions. c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part... Procedure: A. Medical Screening Examination  1.

She sat there for four hours with no medical screening exam before her husband finally decided to put her back in the private vehicle and bring her to (Hospital #2).  It was reported that as the husband was loading up his wife, the (Hospital #1) security guard said sorry it has to be this way ...we are just so backed up all the time with (Hospital #2)  being on diversion.  (Hospital #2) was Not on diversion.  The patient came to (Hospital #2) and was seen promptly....    
(Hospital #2's) Administration has tried to work with (Hospital #1's) Administration on matters such as this to no avail.  We are asking for your review of (Hospital #1's) compliance with EMTALA.  We very much appreciate your time and assistance.""

A list of what was needed was given and a tour of the ED requested.

Four (4) EMTALA signs were observed in the waiting areas. EMTALA signs were also observed located by the triage room and the ambulance entrance.  The ED was noted to have a non-urgent clinic which is open from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.  After patients are triaged, some level three (3), all level four (4) and all level five (5) acuity are sent to the non-urgent side.  The ED Director stated that the hospital's policy for the Triage Nurse is to complete a reassessment of the ED patients every two (2) hours.

Interview with President and CEO of Hospital #2 on 05/24/2016 at 9:25 a.m. revealed that he had met with the Administrator of Hospital #1 in the past... ""I would just love to see this issue worked out, especially because the two area hospitals are all the people in the surrounding area have and there is such a need for the two hospitals to work together.""   

On 06/08/2016 at 11:00 a.m. another visit was made to Hospital #1. The nature of the visit was discussed with the Corporate Compliance for the Administrator and Director of Legal Risk, and the Director of Accreditation.  A list of items were given and a request to meet with the Medical Director of ED.

On 06/08/16 at 11:25 a.m. an interview with the new Medical Director of ED; the Director of Emergency Service; the Director of ED; the Corporate Compliance for the Administrator and Director of Legal Risk; and the Director of Accreditation revealed:
The Director of Emergency Service stated,  ""On 11/27/15 at 6:45 a.m. 13 patients had not been seen from the previous shift.  In addition a total of 137 patients signed in to be seen and there were a total of 35 admissions for this day. We were two registered nurses (RNs) short on both the morning and evening shift due to call-ins.  This was the Friday after Thanksgiving. I tried calling from the RN PRN (as needed) pool but no one was willing to come in on the holiday. On 12/7/15 there were a total of 94 signed in and seen with a total of 24 admissions.  There was coverage on this day. On 01/11/16 90 patients signed in and were seen with 24 admissions. On 05/04/20 98 patients signed in, 4 patients left without being seen and a there was a total of 24 admissions. A Level 1 patient came in during the time Patient #7 was in the ED along with several Level 2 patients. ""  The Medical Director for ED stated,  ""In November 2015 we lost all our Patient Care Representatives who helped in triage, due to budget cuts. The wait times were identified and were sent to the G7 committee. ""   When asked what the G7 committee entailed, he replied,  "" It ' s a committee made up of the hospitals Vice Presidents. It is a 7 person committee which has to approve any spending of the facility due to the financial loss this facility has taken in the last year. ""   The Director of Emergency Services stated that she does a chart audit of 30% (percent) every month and she did notice occasional extended wait times.   ""I came up with an action plan after a patient filed a complaint in February 2016.  I have done much research on AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), have spoken to other hospitals, and I presented a plan to the G7 committed on 05/07/2016 and it was approved.  The Pharmacy will now do all medications and four  Patient Care Technicians were approved to be hired.  The announcements were finalized and the jobs posted on 06/07/2016 and we've already had four applications.  The facility has revised their policies to address this issue, however the policies have not been approved as yet. ""  When asked if they were aware if any of the facility staff has ever told the patients their wait time would be a couple of hours, the Director of Emergency Services stated that she does not believe her staff would ever do that.  ""However, as a courtesy if the wait is longer I ask the triage nurse, when she does the reassessment, to apologize to the patient and reassure them they will be seen. In addition I have instructed them several times to never give a wait time.  All staff has been trained on this.""   The ED Director stated,  ""I would like to add that as of this morning there was eight patients left over for the morning shift to see, 27 scheduled surgeries, 10 patients in the cath lab and their floor census this morning is 180.""   He also stated that the facility has not been on diversion. During these interviews it was noted that the ED had an Alpha Code called, a Bravo Code called and a Code Brown called. The Brown Code was a gunshot that required extra security for the ED.

A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, ...) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could  reasonably  be expected to result in either: a. Placing the health of an individual (or, with respect of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy. b. Serious impairment to bodily functions. c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part... Procedure: A. Medical Screening Examination  1.

Based on interview, record review, and policy review, SSM Health St Joseph Hospital failed to accept an appropriate transfer from another hospital's emergency department (Hospital A) for one patient (#1) of 28 Emergency Department (ED) records reviewed. This failure had the potential to cause harm by delaying stabilizing treatment to any emergent patient that required the specialized capabilities provided at SSM Health St. Joseph Hospital.  The ED average daily census was 97. The hospital received an average of 24 patients transferred in from other facilities per month. The facility census was 161. 

Findings included:

1. Record review of the facility's Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) policy titled, ""EMTALA"", dated July 2008, showed that, ""Patients appropriately transferred from another hospital anywhere within the boundaries of the United States for specialized care, i.e., Obstetrics (OB), Psychiatry, Pediatrics or Trauma must be accepted if this facility has the capacity to treat the patient. It may be requested of the transferring facility to consider more acceptable alternatives (that is a hospital with specialized capabilities within closer proximity); however if the transferring facility still desires to transfer the patient to this facility, the patient must be accepted.""

Record review of the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, revised 07/27/15, and the Medical Staff By-Laws, dated 09/23/13, showed no direction to medical staff related to acceptance of transferred patients. 

2. Record review of Patient #1's ED (referring Hospital A) visit dated 10/02/15 showed the following:

- ED physician note indicated patient was 11 weeks pregnant with a several day history of fever, chills, and diffuse joint pain, patient was recently treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) by her OB Physician, (Hospital B, Physician M). Patient denied vaginal bleeding, spotting, back pain, cramping, rash, lesions, nausea or vomiting.
- ED physician performed bedside Ultrasound (type of imaging that utilizes sound waves to look at internal organs and structures in the body) and noted fetal heart rate of 210 (normal for 11 week fetus is 120 to 160) and a live fetus.
- Laboratory tests showed urine contained protein, blood, white blood cells, red blood cells and leukocytes (indication of infection). Blood test showed blood urea nitrogen (BUN, a kidney function test) with a value of six (normal range 8 to 24), and potassium (K, a mineral in the blood) with a value of 3.2 (normal range 3.5 to 5.1).
- ED Physician L spoke to OB Physician F (a partner of patients regular OB physician) at receiving Hospital B and noted that Physician F refused transfer and to contact ""medicine"".
- The ED physician noted he spoke with Staff I (House Supervisor at receiving hospital), who stated that she was aware of attempt to transfer the patient and confirmed that they refused to accept the patient. ED Physician explained that patient was a patient of a physician in their facility and had a fever, tachycardia (rapid heart beat), a UTI resistant to antibiotics and that his facility had no OB coverage. Staff I expressed that they still refused to accept the transfer.
- Patient #1 was transferred to a different facility (Hospital C) with diagnoses of fever of undetermined origin, pregnant and abnormal fetal heart rate.

3. During a telephone interview on 01/19/16 at 3:10 PM, Hospital A's Manager of Patient Safety and Regulatory Compliance stated the following:

- There were no OB evaluations or treatment services provided by OB/GYN physicians to in patients or ED patients within the last year and one-half. 
- If a pregnant patient presented to the ED with an emergency medical condition (such as motor vehicle accident or an infection), the patient would be stabilized and transferred to a facility that provided OB services.  

During a telephone interview on 01/20/16 at 4:10 PM, Hospital A's Chief of Staff, stated the following:
- The facility did not accept patients who were pregnant.
- The practice was that ED physician transfers pregnant patients if they were in need of hospital care.

- It sounded to her like the patient did not need to be admitted     to OB but did need to be admitted    ;
- She stated that the usual course for an 11 week pregnant patient, without OB symptoms, would be to admit to Hospitalist and have a consult by OB;
- She did not recall a conversation about fetal heart tones or rate but that she usually always asked about this when discussing an OB patient.

3. During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 10:05 AM, Registered Nurse H (RN), SSM Health St Joseph Hospital access line (a dedicated telephone line where staff coordinated calls between physicians wanting to transfer patients into this system), stated that:

- Staff H called the referring facility ED and informed them that this facility was unable to accept the patient transfer for admission. 
- Staff H stated that she did not recall ever refusing a transfer for a service that was offered at this hospital.

During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 4:10 PM, PA, Staff K stated that:

- He stated that the access line RN advised him that the OB Physician had refused to accept this transfer and that the patient had recently seen her primary OB for an office visit. 
- Staff K stated that the Hospitalist doesn't typically accept OB patients, they generally were admitted     directly to the OB doctors, so he had to check with Staff G, (Hospitalist on call) to get direction. 
- After speaking with Staff G he called the access line back and advised them to refuse the transfer for admission. 
- Staff K stated that he never spoke directly with the ED Physician. Staff K stated that he could not add anything to the situation so he let the access line RN call the ED back. 
- Staff K stated that he did not recall ever refusing a transfer for a service that was offered at this hospital. 

During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 9:05 AM, Hospitalist G, stated that:
- She received a call from Staff K regarding the transfer of this patient. She stated that it was concerning that OB had refused this patient. 
- She called Staff F who stated that this patient was recently evaluated by Staff M in the OB office and that this patient did not need to be admitted     to the hospital. Staff G stated that Staff F advised her that there was no indication to admit from an OB stand point and that the sending hospital could handle any medical problem with the patient. 
- Staff G stated that she told Staff F she was going to refuse this transfer and Staff F agreed. 
- Staff G called Staff K back and advised him to refuse the transfer for admission.

- She received a call from the access line RN to advise her that OB and the Hospitalist had refused a transfer from an outside ED. 
- She then received a call from the ED physician at the outside hospital and confirmed with him that this hospital would not accept this transfer. 
- Staff I stated that she believed that ED Physician L, from Hospital A, had a legitimate concern and that she did understand why the OB doctor refused the admission (patient was only 11 weeks pregnant), but she did not understand why Staff G, Hospitalist, refused to accept the patient. 
- She stated that she felt like the Hospitalist should have accepted the patient and consulted with OB. 
- She stated that she was caught in the middle and before she left her shift she emailed her supervisor with the information. 
- Staff I stated that she did not recall ever refusing a patient transfer for a service that was offered at this facility.

4. Record review of an email dated 10/02/15 at 7:03 AM from Staff I to the Vice President of Nursing and the Administrator on-call showed the following:
""I received a call this morning from Staff H at the access line. She stated that a patient who was 11 weeks pregnant was in an ED (Hospital A) with Pyelonephritis (kidney infection), and the ED Physician (Hospital A, Staff L), wanted to transfer the patient to our facility, but OB would not accept her. OB physician (Staff F) was on call for Staff M (patient's regular OB physician) and refused the admission. Staff H called our Physician Assistant (Staff K), who spoke with Staff G (on call Hospitalist), who also refused the admission as she wouldn't have OB to consult. 

During a telephone interview on 12/23/15 at 1:35 PM, Staff J, Chief Medical Officer, stated that he was made aware of the situation that occurred earlier on that morning (10/02/15) but did not explore it any further because he received a report that the patient did not need admission, so there was nothing to follow up. Staff J stated that he had not spoken to Hospital A ED Physician (Staff L).

5. Record review of Patient #1's Medical Record from Hospital C, (facility that ultimately accepted the transfer), showed Patient #1 was admitted     under ""Medicine"" service with OB consult on 10/02/15.

Based on interview and record review, the facility failed to provide a medical screening examination (MSE) sufficient to determine the presence of an emergency medical condition (EMC) for two patients (#7 and #8) of 20 Emergency Department (ED) patient records reviewed. The ED has an average of 2817 visits per month. 

Findings included:

1. Review of the facility's policy titled, ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA),"" dated 05/2016, showed that:
- A physician or nurse practitioner will perform a MSE on every patient presenting to the ED requesting emergency medical treatment in a uniform manner to determine if an EMC exists. 
- If after the MSE, an EMC is deemed to exist, the hospital will provide medical treatment within its capacity and capabilities to stabilize that EMC. 
- A patient is stable for discharge when (for psychiatric patients) it is determined the patient is no longer considered a threat to himself/herself or others. 

2. Review of Patient #7's ED record showed he (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:37 PM, with complaints of ""feeling suicidal right now."" Staff C, Registered Nurse (RN), documented that the patient felt hopeless and helpless because his wife wanted a divorce and thought she may be pregnant. Staff B, ED Physician, documented that the patient had a history of depression without previous thoughts of suicide, and when he asked the patient if he wanted to be admitted     for psychiatric care or discharged    with outpatient treatment and medication, and the patient chose to be discharged    home. The patient was discharged    at 11:33 PM, less than one hour after he arrived. 

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 11:40 AM, Staff C, RN, stated that Patient #7 ""had no tools to work though the situation."" Staff C stated that psychiatric SW was on-call and available for evaluation, which was used from time to time when ""they (the patients) say the right things."" Staff C added that neither psychiatric SW nor the on-call psychiatrist were called in or consulted for Patient #7, and the patient was discharged   .

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 12:54 PM, Staff D, ED Physician stated that Patient #7 had thoughts of suicide but Staff D didn't feel that the patient was at risk to himself. ""I did not feel that he was suicidal. I believe that he was melancholy because his wife didn't want him anymore. He was feeling useless and not important to his wife."" Staff D informed the patient that a local community behavioral health office offered walk-in clinics, prescribed the patient medications, and discharged    the patient, who walked home. Staff D stated that he had the ability to consult with a psychiatrist but did not, that the only time psychiatric SW could be accessed after hours was for psychiatric transfers that required a 96 hour court ordered hold, and even if they were available, he would not have consulted them for Patient #7.  

During an interview on 06/04/18 at 1:00 PM, Staff H, Psychiatrist, stated he was not consulted on Patient #7 when he came to the ED.. 

Review of a March 2018 Physician Call Coverage Schedule, showed that a psychiatrist was on-call and available to the ED on 03/09/18. A note at the bottom of the call schedule showed that Staff H, Psychiatrist, could be contacted for emergencies.

Review of a Psychiatric SW schedule showed that a SW was on-call and available to the ED on 03/09/18.

3. Review of court documents showed that on 03/19/18, an application for evaluation was obtained for Patient #8, after the patient obtained injuries that were not present prior to his placement in an isolated cell (indicates they were self-inflicted), and then spread feces on his wounds and stated it was a process for healing. A court-ordered 96-hour detention was issued for Patient #8 to be detained, evaluated and treated for up to 96 hours by the local hospital, unless further detention and treatment was necessary.

Review of Patient #8's ED record, showed he (MDS) dated [DATE] at 10:50 AM, in custody from a local jail with a 96-hour court-ordered hold. The patient had a psychiatric history of depression with patient reported psychosis (a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality), and intermittent ""strange behavior"" for the previous two weeks while incarcerated. He refused food or drink and would not sleep while he was in the ""hole"" (isolated jail cell), and would insert his finger into his rectum and wipe feces on himself. Staff E, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse-Certified Nurse Practitioner (APRN-CNP), did not find the patient to be suicidal, homicidal or psychotic, and documented that jail staff escorts were informed that it may be a long wait to admit the patient to the behavioral health unit, and instructed them that one of the jail staff would need to stay with the patient until admission occurred. Staff E further documented that jail staff contacted their supervisor and chose to leave with the patient, who was fit for confinement (absence of a medical or psychiatric emergency).

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 10:17 AM, Staff I, ED RN stated that Patient #8 was upset and had made some comments while in jail about suicide, and had placed his finger in his rectum and wiped feces on himself. The patient was not evaluated by a psychiatric SW or psychiatrist. and was discharged    to jail staff to return another time for further care. ""Apparently this happens frequently at night. They will send patients with 96 hour holds back to jail."" Staff I was unaware if the patient ever returned for inpatient psychiatric care.

During an interview on 06/05/18 at 9:24 AM, County Jail Administrator J, stated that Patient #8 was evaluated at the hospital ED, and ""they sent him back. He never received inpatient (psychiatric) care.""

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 1:51 PM, Staff E, APRN-CNP, stated that Patient #8 presented to the ED from jail, with a 96-hour court-ordered hold, a history of depression and substance abuse, as well as patient reported psychosis (abnormal thinking and perceptions). The patient had been in solitary (""the hole"", isolated cell), and while in solitary, refused to eat, drink or take his medications, and had spread feces on himself. Staff E stated that she did not believe the patient was actively psychotic, suicidal or homicidal, but needed to see a psychiatrist. There wasn't an available bed on the behavioral health unit, ""we were busy,"" and didn't know how long it would be before a psychiatric bed was available for the patient, so the patient was discharged    and the jail staff took the patient back to jail. The patient was not seen by the on-call psychiatrist or psychiatric SW, and Staff E did not know if the patient was ever returned to the hospital for psychiatric care. Staff E added that ED physicians and APRN-CNPs could evaluate psychiatric patients and override a 96-hour court-ordered hold, but she did not override Patient #8's. 

During an interview on 05/31/18 at 12:20 PM, Staff J, ED Physician, stated that he saw Patient #8, who was confused, but was not psychotic. ""We decided that he needed psychiatric help, but they (jail staff) wanted to take him (back to jail). They have secure facilities, specialized area that is safe ....He would be safe in the area that he was going to."" Staff J stated that ED Physicians could fulfill a psychiatric evaluation for a 96-hour court-ordered hold, but other times, it required more evaluation than just the ED Physician. Staff J added that the facility had psychiatric SW that could be utilized, or the on-call psychiatrist. 

During an interview on 06/04/18 at 1:00 PM, Staff H, Psychiatrist, stated that:
- When Patient #8 came to the ED under a 96-hour hold, the fact that there was not an available bed at the time shouldn't matter, and that jail staff could have stayed with the patient until he was place in the locked unit. 
- Ideally, it was ""best to bring everyone into the psychiatric unit.""
- Psychiatric SW or the on-call psychiatrist were available for consult. 

Review of a Psychiatric SW schedule showed that a SW was on-call and available to the ED on 03/22/18.

Review of a March 2018 Physician Call Coverage Schedule, showed that a psychiatrist was on-call and available to the ED on 03/22/18. 

The facility failed to provide an appropriate MSE to Patients #7 and #8, when they failed to utilize psychiatric SW and/or and on-call psychiatrist, in the evaluation of patients who presented with  psychiatric presentation.

Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to provide stabilization for one patient (#4) of 30 Emergency Department (ED) and Obstetric (OB) records reviewed.  This failure had the potential to affect all patients who required stabilization.  The hospital's ED average monthly census over the past six months was 1500.  The OB Department averaged 40 patients each month.

Findings included:

Review of the hospital's policy titled, ""Lebanon Labor EMTALA,"" dated 01/23/20, showed that if the hospital determines that an individual has a medical emergency, it must stabilize the condition or provide for an appropriate transfer.  The decision to transport is determined by factors that may include but are not limited to gestational age less than 36 weeks, the stage of labor, the medical status of the mother or the fetus (unborn child), and the availability of services required.  The transferring physician certifies in writing that the benefits expected from the treatment at another facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or unborn child from the transfer.  The hospital is obligated to assure and document that the patient has been provided information regarding the hospital's obligation for examination and treatment, the risks/benefit ratio of the proposed transfer, and a signed informed consent.

Review of Ambulance #1's report, dated 09/14/20, showed that an ambulance was dispatched to a residence for a [AGE]-year-old female who was suffering from abdominal pain.  The ambulance arrived at the scene at 6:58 PM, and the crew documented that Patient #4 was pregnant, complained of lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back, and that she had a sensation to push and ""pee"".  The ambulance arrived at the hospital's OB unit on 09/14/20, at 7:27 PM.

Review of the medical record, showed that Patient #4, a [AGE]-year-old uninsured female pregnant at 23 weeks, 5 days gestation arrived at the hospital's obstetrical unit on 9/14/2020 at 7:30 PM in active preterm labor and placed in outpatient observation (not admitted     to the hospital as an inpatient).  At 9:08 PM, OB physician I documented under ""OB History and Physical"" that patient # 4 ""is feeling a regular pelvic cramping but states that it is severe in nature.""  Further documentation showed ""Of note, the patient has (sic) not a current patient of the Mercy OB/GYN system and has an outside provider and (sic) Rolla.""  Under ""Physical Exam"" OB physician I documented he performed a sterile vaginal exam and that the patient had ""Bulging amniotic membranes, unable to fully evaluate cervix.""  OB physician I performed a speculum exam and documented ""Unable to complete based on bulging membranes.""  Under ""Assessment/Plan""  OB physician I documented ""Advanced preterm labor""  - ""Patient with exam findings consistent with advanced cervical dilation and bulging fetal membranes.""  ""High risk of imminent delivery.""  Further documentation showed OB physician I ordered a medication (Procardia) to suppress patient # 4's premature labor, a medication (BMZ 12 mgn) used to mature lung function in fetuses at risk for preterm delivery, an antibiotic medication (Ancef ) to prevent group B streptococcus infection in a newborn, an infusion of magnesium sulfate to aid in slowing preterm labor and to prevent injuries to a preterm baby's brain, and then began the process of arranging transfer to Hospital B's Labor and Delivery unit located 150 miles away.   

At 10:45 PM OB physician I documented that patient # 4 ""has advanced cervical dilation and is currently not actively contracting""  and that Hospital B had agreed to accept the transfer at 10:22 PM.  Under ""Details of Transfer"" OB physician I documented that the ambulance transporting patient # 4 to Hospital B was equipped with basic life support equipment (meaning the ambulance did not have the appropriate equipment for managing advanced life support or a preterm delivery).  Under ""Transfer Benefits"" OB physician I documented that Hospital B had an available Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and under ""Transfer Risks"" OB physician I documented ""Delivery en route, Miscarriage, Worsening vaginal bleeding, Progression of labor, Fetal demise, Increased pain."" 

Review of Ambulance #2's report, dated 09/14/20, indicated that the ambulance crew arrived at Patient #4's bedside on the hospital OB unit at 11:39 PM.  The ambulance crew documented that the Registered Nurse (RN) stated the patient was 23-weeks pregnant and (MDS) dated [DATE], at 7:30 PM with complaint of contractions, and that this was her first pregnancy.  The RN stated that Patient #4 was on Magnesium Sulfate (a medication used to prevent seizures in pregnancy) and Lactated Ringers (intravenous fluid that contains electrolytes) infusion.  ""RN states patient is in stable condition & has had no recent contractions, however, upon making patient contact patient started to c/o (complain of) having contractions.""  ""RN made visual inspection to find no crowning.""  Further documentation showed that at 36.9 miles into the 150 miles transport, at 12:22 AM on 9/15/2020 patient # 4 precipitously delivered in the ambulance forcing the ambulance crew to emergently divert to the closest hospital (Hospital D, a military health system hospital).  

Review of a 9/15/2020 air ambulance trip report dispatched to Hospital D at 7:14 AM showed that patient # 4 ""was being transported by ground ambulance to an outside hospital (Hospital B) and precipitously delivered a 23 week fetus in an ambulance prior to arrival.""  ""Patient arrived to the outside hospital (Hospital D) 10 minutes later and had an estimated blood loss of greater than 500 mls (1/2 liter).""  Further documentation showed a critical care transport team transported patient # 4 and her newborn baby to Hospital E for further stabilizing treatment.   

Review of the hospital provided emailed documents dated 11/09/20, at 5:04 PM, showed that OB nursing staff had successfully completed the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) curriculum of the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association for resuscitating infants who are not breathing or have a pulse at the time of delivery and/or immediately afterwards.    
- Staff H, Primary OB RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 11/30/2020.
- Staff J, RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 06/30/2021.
- Staff M, Secondary OB RN, was NRP certified with an expiration date of 09/30/2022.

During an interview on 09/16/20 at 4:45 PM, Staff F, OB and Nursery Manager, stated that she would not have let Patient #4 be transferred with a bulging bag and complete dilation of the cervix. She had called Hospital C (60 miles away), in the past, and they had sent the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU, unit for premature and ill newborns) team, when a baby had been delivered at the hospital and needed resuscitation.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 9:34 AM, Staff L, experienced OB/GYN, (on staff at the hospital for eight years and had a total of 35 years of experience, but not involved in Patient #4's care) stated that in his professional opinion, Patient #4 should not have been transferred.  He had heard about Patient #4 being transferred, and he had discussed the event with Staff I, OB/GYN, the morning after the transfer occurred.

During a telephone interview on 09/23/20 at 11:05 AM, Staff U, OB RN, Hospital B, stated that: 
- She was the labor and delivery Charge Nurse on 09/14/20 and spoke to Staff I, OB/GYN, when he called about a patient that he wanted to transfer.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, told her that Patient #4 was a first time 23-week-pregnant female with a bulging bag.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that he was unsure of the cervical dilation due to the bulging bag, and was concerned about amniotomy (artificial rupture of the amniotic sac) upon exam, but the bag had not moved down since his initial exam.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that Patient #4 had been contracting and said, ""I don't have anything for neonatal resuscitation and I can't deliver her here.""
- She was concerned about Patient #4 riding in an ambulance, and told Staff I, OB/GYN, that she was concerned about a high-risk delivery, and offered the NICU team.  She gave Staff I, OB/GYN, the contact information for the high-risk specialty service, in case the resuscitation team was needed.
- Staff N, MFM, called Staff U, OB RN, Hospital B, to discuss the report of Patient #4 that she had received from Staff I, OB/GYN, because Staff N, MFM, thought the transport would be safe.
- She told Staff N, MFM, she was concerned that the transport of Patient #4 would not be safe because when she asked Staff I, OB/GYN, about checking the dilation of the cervix and the bulging bag, he had told her that he was unsure of the cervical dilation due to the bulging bag.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 7:54 AM, Staff I, OB/GYN, stated that:
- He examined Patient #4 and she was completely dilated with a bulging bag of water.
- Staff K, Pediatrician (a specialty physician focused on the care of babies, children, adolescents, and young adults), stated that babies usually go to Hospital B if they were 23 weeks.  The cut off for resuscitation was 23 weeks at the hospital.
- There was no contact made with Hospital C, which was 60 miles away, and had a NICU. Staff K, Pediatrician, told him that Hospital C did not do 23-week resuscitations and they could not handle a 23-week baby.
- He called the OB floor at Hospital B, and spoke to the Generalist OB, who did not accept the transfer, because Patient #4 was a high-risk delivery, and that was not his expertise.
- He called Staff N, MFM, on call at Hospital B, who specialized in high-risk deliveries, and asked, ""What would you do with a 23 week pregnant patient who has a bulging bag of water?"", and Staff N, MFM, said he could transfer Patient #4 to Hospital B.
- He offered to keep Patient #4 overnight, and then transport, but Staff N, MFM, told him he would not need to do that.  He could transfer Patient #4 now.
- He called Labor and Delivery at Hospital B, and spoke to Staff U, RN, who told him he could not transfer Patient #4.  He told Staff U, RN, that Staff N, MFM, recommended the transfer, and there were no other options. This hospital did not have the capabilities to care for a 23-week old baby that would require a stay in the NICU.
- He called to speak with the NICU Physician, (whose name he did not recall) at Hospital B, and requested them to send a crew of NICU doctors.
- The NICU Physician called back and stated that it was not feasible to have a NICU team sitting there when they had no idea when Patient #4 would deliver.  His recommendation was to transfer Patient #4 to where the NICU doctors were located at Hospital B.
- He spoke to Staff N, MFM, again, stating that Staff U, RN, told him he could not transfer Patient #4, even though she had recommended transfer, and the NICU Physician recommended transfer.  Staff N, MFM, told him that she would call and get Hospital B to accept the transport.

Review of Hospital Licensure data showed that Hospitals C and E, located approximately 60 miles from Mercy Hospital Lebanon had a 28 bed and 46 bed respectively, Level III Neonatal Intensive Care unit (Level IV is the highest level) capable of providing care to premature and critically ill infants.  Hospital E's capabilities include a neonatal transport team that provides transport for critically ill newborns to its NICU.  

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 7:35 AM, Staff H, Primary OB RN, stated that:
- She performed a vaginal exam and documented that Patient #4 was fully dilated with a bulging bag.
- Staff I, OB/GYN, had approval from Staff N, MFM, Hospital B, to transfer Patient #4.
- Staff U, RN, from Hospital B, called back and said that they would not take Patient #4.
- Staff N, MFM, called back and said it was okay to transfer Patient #4, even though Staff U, RN, said that it was not okay.
- She would not normally transport a fully dilated patient, because they can deliver at any time, but Hospital B said they would take Patient #4.

During a telephone interview on 09/17/20 at 10:08 AM, Staff M, Secondary OB RN, stated that:
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, call Staff N, MFM, and speak to her about transferring Patient #4.
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, speaking with Staff U, RN, from Hospital B, who did not want him to send Patient #4.
- She heard Staff I, OB/GYN, speaking with the Staff N, MFM, again, who told him to transfer Patient #4.
- Hospital D, called to get report on Patient #4, who had given birth en route to Hospital B, and this hospital was not aware that Patient #4 had delivered en route.

During an interview on 09/17/20 at 8:38 AM, Staff K, Pediatrician, stated that:
- Staff I, OB/GYN, had examined Patient #4 and had discovered that she had bulging membranes and was fully dilated.
- He heard that Patient #4's contractions were not consistent.
- He witnessed the discussions that Staff I, OB/GYN, had with the generalist OB on call and Staff N, MFM, at Hospital B, and he was aware that the Staff N, MFM, had accepted the transfer of Patient #4.

During a telephone interview on 09/17/20 at 1:28 PM, Staff N, MFM, Hospital B, stated that:
- She received a call on 09/14/20, at 8:52 PM from Staff I, OB/GYN, stating that he had an urgent consult.
- Patient #4 was 23 weeks pregnant and had a bulging bag of water, but she was not aware of the cervical dilation.
- She then called the Hospitalist (physician whose primary professional focus in the general medical care of hospitalized    patients) to inform them of the transfer, and Staff U, RN, was with the Hospitalist at that time.
- At about 10:00 PM, she received another call from Staff I, OB/GYN, stating that he was having issues transferring Patient #4, because Staff U, RN, Hospital B, had told him he could not transfer Patient #4.
- She then called Staff U, RN, discussed Patient #4, and informed Staff U, RN, that she had accepted the transfer of Patient #4.
- She offered the NICU team, but Staff I, OB/GYN, declined, saying that the labor slowed and there was enough time to transfer.
- When asked if Patient #4 was stable for transfer, her response was that she could not speak to that because it was hard to predict with a bulging bag of fluid. 

During a telephone interview on 09/21/20 at 8:41 PM, Staff Q, Paramedic, Ambulance #1, stated that:
- Patient #4 was at her home, tearful, and stated she could not walk, so he carried her to the Emergency Medical System (EMS) cot. 
- Patient #4 was having contractions and he instructed her to tell him when it started and when it stopped.
- En route to the hospital, Patient #4 stated that she had to go to the bathroom, which was a possible sign of active labor, and wanted to push.  He informed Patient #4 that was not a good idea.

During a telephone interview on 09/23/20 at 9:02 AM, Staff S, Paramedic, Ambulance #2, stated that:
- He was told that Patient #4 was a first-time pregnant, [AGE] year old female who, at the time, was not having any contractions.
- Patient #4 was transferred to the EMS cot and complained of pain.  Patient #4 was examined by a nurse, who stated that there was no crowning.
- He was not aware of the extent of cervical dilation for Patient #4.
- Patient #4 complained that, ""the baby was going to come"".
- He monitored Patient #4 in the ambulance, but did not have equipment available to monitor the baby.  He did not have a cardiac monitor or oxygen for the baby.
- While en route, he delivered the baby who had a weak cry and was breathing. He suctioned the baby and gave her to Patient #4 to keep warm, until they arrived at Hospital D.

Based on record review, staff and provider interviews, review of the facility Medical Staff Rules and Regulation and the Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) policies, the facility failed to ensure their Medical Staff Rules and Regulation and their EMTALA policy followed the EMTALA regulations regarding providing necessary stabilizing treatment of an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) within their capabilities prior to a transfer. One of 21 sampled patients (Patient 1) did not receive a surgical consult or surgical intervention prior to transfer despite the facilities capability, placing the patient's health at risk at the time of the transfer.  The total sample size was 21.  The hospital's Director of Quality and Compliance was notified at  1:40 pm on 2/17/17 that immediate jeopardy conditions existed (IJ).  Patient # 21 presented to the ED with severe abdominal pain and laboratory and imaging testing demonstrated the patient had a small bowel obstruction with possible mesenteric ischemia.  Despite its capabilities, which included an on-call surgeon and gynecologist, the hospital inappropriately transferred patient # 1.     While patient # 21 was in the ED, the ED physician contacted the on-call surgeon twice.  The on-call surgeon requested the ED physician transfer the patient to another hospital unnecessarily delaying stabilizing treatment of the patient's emergency medical condition. The hospital's failure to stabilize a patient's emergency medical condition within its capabilities and capacity could lead to serious complications including death of any patient with an unstable emergency medical condition.  

Findings are:

A.   Review of facility document titled ""Medical Staff Rules and Regulations"" revised February 2016 under the section titled ""Emergency Treatment and Stabilization"" states that ""Persons with emergency medical conditions will be treated within the capability of the Hospital's dedicated emergency department (ED) and their condition stabilized, OR the person will be transferred to another facility in accordance with Hospital policy.""  

This document does not support the EMTALA regulations due to the regulation states that the hospital shall provide medical treatment within it's capability that minimizes the risks to the individuals health.

B.  Review of facility policy titled ""EMTALA-Patient Screening, Treatment and Transfer Requirements Under Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"" dated 3-19-15 states, ""An individual in an unstable EMC may be transferred only by an ""appropriate transfer"" as that term is defined by EMTALA, requiring: a) THE HOSPITAL SHALL PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN IT CAPABILITY THAT MINIMIZES THE RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S HEALTH and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child.""

C.   Review of the hospital's Medicare Database Worksheet verified by the hospital quality coordinator on 2/1/17 revealed the hospital's capabilities include a dedicated Emergency Department, non-surgical cardiac and medical/surgical ICU, inpatient and outpatient surgical services and obstetric services.

D.  An interview on 2/1/17 at 1:30 PM, with ED MD-A the physician attending to Patient 1 in the ED on 1/14/17, confirmed that the patient had an EMC at the time of discharge. ED MD-A stated, ""I felt that the patient was stable due to having placed an IV (intravenous), a NG (naso-gastric tube -used to decompress the stomach) and provided treatment including lab, xrays and medication.  I did believe that at the time of transfer the patient (Patient 1) required possible immediate surgical intervention due to the scan showed possible small bowel obstruction and possible signs of peritonitis (inflammation of the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs)."" ED MD-A did identify that the hospital has a general surgeon's on call, and I did visit with (On Call MD-B the general surgeon on call on 1/14/17) on the phone about the case twice that evening at 6:10 PM and 8:05 PM. ""I reviewed the numbers (lab values received), the scan report, and the history of Patient 1 having had surgery in November of 2016 at (Hospital B-65 miles away) for abdominal sacral colpopexy (An abdominal surgery which mesh is stitched into the top of the vagina and attached to a strong ligament overlying the sacrum (tail bone) to correct a prolapse of the pelvic organs.)  On Call MD-B told me that it is the advice of the American College of General Surgeons, that for 90 days after surgery, the surgeon is responsible for complications from that surgery and On Call MD-B thought that was the case.""  ED MD-A did call the surgeon (OB/GYN MD-C an Obstetrics and Gynecology [OB/GYN] Specialist) at Hospital B that was on call for the surgeon that performed the November 2016 surgery.  ED MD-A stated, ""(OB/GYN MD-C) stated that (she) assisted with Patient 1's case in November.  OB/GYN MD-C stated that they do not do surgery for bowel obstruction, that would be referred to their general surgeon (On Call MD-D) at Hospital B.""  ED MD-A stated, ""I then called (On Call MD-D the general surgeon at Hospital B) and On Call MD-D accepted the patient for a transfer.""  The patient was then transferred to Hospital B via ambulance.

Patient 1 presented to the ED with complaints of severe abdominal pain.  The ED MD-A did call the general surgeon on call (On Call MD-B) twice while Patient 1 was in the ED.  On Call MD-B did not come to the ED to examine the patient prior to being transferred.

E.  An interview on 2/2/17 at 10:30 AM, with On Call MD-B the general surgeon on call on 1/14/17, confirmed that (ED MD-A) did call twice to review the case, including the test results and (Patient 1's) history of just having surgery in November 2016.   ""I did not come in and see (Patient 1), I told ED MD-A that as a surgeon that it is our oath through the American College of Surgery that if you did the 1st surgery, that surgeon usually follows up with any complications within 90 days of the surgery.  That way they know exactly what they did, including the placement of the mesh and where they anchored it in this case."" On Call MD-B stated that he had assisted in this type of surgery here in the past but did not do this patients surgery.  ""It  is something we can do at this hospital but would need one of the OB/GYN specialist here to assist me.  I felt that it would be better for the continuity of care for this patient to return to the original surgeon.  (ED MD-A) reviewed the test, lab and scan results with me and that there was a NG tube placed, IV medication for comfort and nausea, from that information I felt the patient would be stable to be transferred to (Hospital B).""

F.  Review of Patient 1's medical record revealed in the nurses notes that the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 3:55 PM with a complaint of intermittent severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.  Was seen here Friday (1/13/17) early AM for these symptoms.  

ED MD-A's note revealed, Patient complains of continued abdominal pain with intermittent episodes of vomiting.  Patient was evaluated in emergency room    shortly after midnight on 1/13/17.  Patient had negative exam and negative plain films.  Patient had nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  The patient was given Zofran (medicine for nausea and vomiting) and had improvement of the pain symptoms.  (Patient 1) reported that the pain would return after she had been without vomiting for a period of time.  Pain persisted throughout the day and patient presented to the ED for evaluation.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain or urinary frequency.  ""The patient reported that (gender) had an abdominal sacral colpopexy in November performed by (OB/GYN MD-C's partner).  Patient reports had mesh placed along the sacrum.  Patient was having pelvic prolapse symptoms prior to the surgery.  Patient has not had any complications with the surgery to this point.""

ED MD-A's physical exam identified that Patient 1's abdomen was soft, hypoactive bowel sounds (slow bowel sounds), moderate diffuse tenderness with increased tenderness in the periumbilical (the belly button area) and suprapubic (the front bone of the pelvis) region more in midline.  Positive rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure in the abdomen). Positive guarding (tensing of abdominal wall muscles to guard the abdomen).  Positive heeltap by report. (the jarring to the heel causes abdominal pain). Pain does not localize to the right lower quadrant.""

ED MD-A ordered the following tests:
-insertion of an IV
-IV zofran for nausea
-CBC-a complete blood count to evaluate the overall health of patient including anemia, infection, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  RESULTS: WBC (white blood count-shows infection) 14.7 High [3.5-10.5]
-CMP-a comprehensive metabolic profile used to measure glucose/sugar level, electrolytes, kidney  and liver function.  RESULTS: Glucose 169 High [65-100]; Potassium 3.4 Low [3.5-5.5]
-CRP-a c-reactive protein level used to check for inflammation in the body.  RESULTS: 0.3  Normal [0.2-0.8]
-Lactic Acid/Lactate- a test that can identify possible severe infection (sepsis).  RESULTS: 0.84 low [0.90-1.70]
-Lipase-a test to look at the lipase enzyme that can identify possible issues with the pancreas. RESULTS: 111 Normal [70-300]
-Urinalysis-essentially negative
-CT Abdomen/pelvis-a scan of the abdomen and pelvis area. RESULTS: Impression: 1)small bowel obstruction. Internal hernia and/or closed-loop obstruction not excluded. (a protrusion of an internal organ into the abdominal cavity); 2) Thick walled small bowel loops in the left lower quadrant, could relate to infection/inflammation or ischemic bowel (dead piece of bowel); 3) Mesenteric edema (fluid in the fold of tissue that attaches organs to the body wall) and interloop ascities (fluid) adjacent to the obstructed bowel loops.; 4) Abdominal and pelvic ascities.

ED MD-A's Medical Decision Making Note at 8:25 PM identified:  That on exam the patient has findings consistent with peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane peritoneum, that lines the inner abdominal wall and covers the organs in you abdomen).  She had rebound tenderness and point tenderness. CT scan revealed evidence of small bowel obstruction.  There are thickened areas within the small intestine suggestive of possible ischemia.  I spoke with (On Call MD-B) and had an NG tube placed.  (On Call MD-B) requested patient be transferred to (Hospital B) for continuity of care.  I spoke with the on-call physician OB/GYN MD-C at (Hospital B).  (OB/GYN MD-C) requested I contact the on-call General surgeon (On Call MD-D) at Hospital B.  I did speak with (On Call MD-D) and he has accepted patient in transfer. I again did speak with (On Call -B) to see if patient would require surgery prior to transfer.  (On Call -B) reports patient is stable for transfer to (Hospital B).  Lactic acid is normal. NG output has been 240 cc (cubic centimeters) of fluid.  Patient has had 2 separate doses of IV morphine prior to transfer.  Final diagnosis: Small Bowel obstruction status post abdominal sacral colpopexy November 2016.""

G.  Review of the completed Transfer Consent/Certification form dated 1/14/17 at 8:43 PM identified the following:
-The patient is stable so that, within reasonable medical probability, no deterioration of patient's condition is likely to result from the transfer.
-Reason for transfer (benefits)- Appropriate facility not available at (this hospital name).; Specialized physician/diagnostic services required.; Patient is not in active labor with imminent delivery/specialized OB care needed.; Expected benefits of treatment at another facility outweigh risks of transfer.
-Risk of transfer- Deterioration in condition: risk of increased pain, risk of ischemic bowel, risk of perforation (a hole open up in the bowel) and transportation risk.
 
When inquired of ED MD-A why, Continuity of care was not identified as a benefit, ED MD-A indicated that the surgeon that accepted the patient was a general surgeon (On Call MD-D) and not the surgeons (OB/GYN MD-C and partner) that performed the previous surgery.  Therefore didn't feel that the continuity of care was not indicated to be identified.
 
H.  An interview with ED Med Director MD-E identified as the ED medical director, on 2/2/17 at 11:30 AM stated, Patient 1 had an EMC during the ED stay that required treatment.    ""The patient needed stabilizing treatment and care.""  When asked if the patient was appropriate for transfer or treatment here, ED Med Director MD-E replied, ""We could have provided the treatment here, we have the capability."" When asked if Patient 1 would have been a high anesthesia risk.  ED Med Director MD-E stated, ""I think a lower risk patient from anesthesia point of view, no history of cardiac, renal or pulmonary disease and not obese.""  ""In my opinion with the NG tube, IV fluids and pain management, I feel that (Patient 1) was stable for the transfer.""  When inquired of the risk of the transfer. ED Med Director MD-E indicated that ""perforation could occur, not highly likely or Hypotension (low blood pressure) if turns septic (systemic infection), not highly likely in the 60-70 minutes it takes to get there (Hospital B).

I.  Review of the privileges of the general surgeon and the OB/Gyn physicians revealed:
-On Call MD-B had privileges to repair rectocele, enterocele, cystocele, or pelvic prolapse.
-The 3 OB/GYN physicians (OB/GYN MD-F, OB/GYN MD-G and OB/GYN MD-H) on staff had privileges for rectocele, enterocele, cystocele, pelvic prolapse repair.

Review of the Physician on-call list revealed that On Call MD-B and OB/GYN MD-H were on call.  There was a surgical team and anesthesia services on call.  Review of the Surgical Log identified that there was no surgery being performed on 1/14/17 from 3:55 PM to 8:56 PM  while at the hospital to prevent the hospital from surgical intervention within its capabilities.

J.  Review of the ICU bed availability revealed that thefacility has 9 ICU beds and they had a census of 6 in ICU on 1/14/17.

Review of the surgical case mix from 7/1/16-12/31/16 revealed that there were 4 cases of exploratory laporotomy (surgical operation where the abdomen is opened and the abdominal organs examined for injury or disease) with resections (surgical removal of a piece of bowel that is blocked or diseased) performed.

Review of the surgical case mix from 7/1/16-12/31/16 revealed that there were 23 total surgical cases performed by this hospitals general surgeons for the  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED][a painful obstruction of the intestine].

This surgical mix identifies that the facility had the capability to treat Patient 1, therefore not requiring a transfer to (Hospital B).

I.  Review of Patient 1's information from the receiving hospital (Hospital B) medical record revealed:
-Patient 1 was admitted [DATE] at 22:34 (10:34 PM) for direct admission to the surgical floor.
-Pre operative History and Physical dated 1/14/17 at 23:18 (11:18 PM) by On Call MD-D stated, ""I think clearly this patient does need to go to the OR (surgery).  Recommended proceeding with exploratory laparotomy.""
-Per the Anesthesia Record, Patient 1 arrived in the surgery suite at 2340 (11:40 PM) on 1/14/17 for the exploratory laparotomy.

The On Call MD-D was a general surgeon that prepared Patient 1 for surgery within 1 hour of arrival to Hospital B.  Review of the sending hospital (Hospital A) surgical case mix identifies that Hospital A had the capability to treat Patient 1, therefore Patient 1 would not have required a transfer to (Hospital B) for stabilization of the EMC.

BASED ON RECORD REVIEW, STAFF AND PROVIDER INTERVIEWS, REVIEW OF THE FACILITY MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATION AND THE EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND LABOR ACT (EMTALA) POLICIES, THE FACILITY FAILED TO ENSURE THEIR MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATION AND THEIR EMTALA POLICY FOLLOWED THE EMTALA REGULATIONS REGARDING PROVIDING NECESSARY STABILIZING TREATMENT OF AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION (EMC) WITHIN THEIR CAPABILITIES PRIOR TO A TRANSFER. ONE OF 21 SAMPLED PATIENTS (PATIENT 1) DID NOT RECEIVE A SURGICAL CONSULT OR SURGICAL INTERVENTION PRIOR TO TRANSFER DESPITE THE FACILITIES CAPABILITY, PLACING THE PATIENT'S HEALTH AT RISK AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER.  THE TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE WAS 21.  THE HOSPITAL'S DIRECTOR OF QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE WAS NOTIFIED AT  1:40 PM ON 2/17/17 THAT IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY CONDITIONS EXISTED (IJ).  PATIENT # 21 PRESENTED TO THE ED WITH SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN AND LABORATORY AND IMAGING TESTING DEMONSTRATED THE PATIENT HAD A SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION WITH POSSIBLE MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA.  DESPITE ITS CAPABILITIES, WHICH INCLUDED AN ON-CALL SURGEON AND GYNECOLOGIST, THE HOSPITAL INAPPROPRIATELY TRANSFERRED PATIENT # 1.     WHILE PATIENT # 21 WAS IN THE ED, THE ED PHYSICIAN CONTACTED THE ON-CALL SURGEON TWICE.  THE ON-CALL SURGEON REQUESTED THE ED PHYSICIAN TRANSFER THE PATIENT TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL UNNECESSARILY DELAYING STABILIZING TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. THE HOSPITAL'S FAILURE TO STABILIZE A PATIENT'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION WITHIN ITS CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING DEATH OF ANY PATIENT WITH AN UNSTABLE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION.  

FINDINGS ARE:

A.   REVIEW OF FACILITY DOCUMENT TITLED ""MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATIONS"" REVISED FEBRUARY 2016 UNDER THE SECTION TITLED ""EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND STABILIZATION"" STATES THAT ""PERSONS WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS WILL BE TREATED WITHIN THE CAPABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL'S DEDICATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) AND THEIR CONDITION STABILIZED, OR THE PERSON WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOSPITAL POLICY.""  

THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE EMTALA REGULATIONS DUE TO THE REGULATION STATES THAT THE HOSPITAL SHALL PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN IT'S CAPABILITY THAT MINIMIZES THE RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUALS HEALTH.

B.  REVIEW OF FACILITY POLICY TITLED ""EMTALA-PATIENT SCREENING, TREATMENT AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS UNDER EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND "" DATED 3-19-15 STATES, ""AN INDIVIDUAL IN AN UNSTABLE EMC MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY BY AN ""APPROPRIATE TRANSFER"" AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED BY EMTALA, REQUIRING: A) THE HOSPITAL SHALL PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN IT CAPABILITY THAT MINIMIZES THE RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S HEALTH AND, IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR, THE HEALTH OF THE UNBORN CHILD.""

C.   REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE DATABASE WORKSHEET VERIFIED BY THE HOSPITAL QUALITY COORDINATOR ON 2/1/17 REVEALED THE HOSPITAL'S CAPABILITIES INCLUDE A DEDICATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, NON-SURGICAL CARDIAC AND MEDICAL/SURGICAL ICU, INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SURGICAL SERVICES AND OBSTETRIC SERVICES.

D.  AN INTERVIEW ON 2/1/17 AT 1:30 PM, WITH ED MD-A THE PHYSICIAN ATTENDING TO PATIENT 1 IN THE ED ON 1/14/17, CONFIRMED THAT THE PATIENT HAD AN EMC AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. ED MD-A STATED, ""I FELT THAT THE PATIENT WAS STABLE DUE TO HAVING PLACED AN IV (INTRAVENOUS), A NG (NASO-GASTRIC TUBE -USED TO DECOMPRESS THE STOMACH) AND PROVIDED TREATMENT INCLUDING LAB, XRAYS AND MEDICATION.  I DID BELIEVE THAT AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER THE PATIENT (PATIENT 1) REQUIRED POSSIBLE IMMEDIATE SURGICAL INTERVENTION DUE TO THE SCAN SHOWED POSSIBLE SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AND POSSIBLE SIGNS OF PERITONITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE THIN TISSUE THAT LINES THE INNER WALL OF THE ABDOMEN AND COVERS MOST OF THE ABDOMINAL ORGANS)."" ED MD-A DID IDENTIFY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS A GENERAL SURGEON'S ON CALL, AND I DID VISIT WITH (ON CALL MD-B THE GENERAL SURGEON ON CALL ON 1/14/17) ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE CASE TWICE THAT EVENING AT 6:10 PM AND 8:05 PM. ""I REVIEWED THE NUMBERS (LAB VALUES RECEIVED), THE SCAN REPORT, AND THE HISTORY OF PATIENT 1 HAVING HAD SURGERY IN NOVEMBER OF 2016 AT (HOSPITAL B-65 MILES AWAY) FOR ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY (AN ABDOMINAL SURGERY WHICH MESH IS STITCHED INTO THE TOP OF THE VAGINA AND ATTACHED TO A STRONG LIGAMENT OVERLYING THE SACRUM (TAIL BONE) TO CORRECT A PROLAPSE OF THE PELVIC ORGANS.)  ON CALL MD-B TOLD ME THAT IT IS THE ADVICE OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF GENERAL SURGEONS, THAT FOR 90 DAYS AFTER SURGERY, THE SURGEON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLICATIONS FROM THAT SURGERY AND ON CALL MD-B THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CASE.""  ED MD-A DID CALL THE SURGEON (OB/GYN MD-C AN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY [OB/GYN] SPECIALIST) AT HOSPITAL B THAT WAS ON CALL FOR THE SURGEON THAT PERFORMED THE NOVEMBER 2016 SURGERY.  ED MD-A STATED, ""(OB/GYN MD-C) STATED THAT (SHE) ASSISTED WITH PATIENT 1'S CASE IN NOVEMBER.  OB/GYN MD-C STATED THAT THEY DO NOT DO SURGERY FOR BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, THAT WOULD BE REFERRED TO THEIR GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AT HOSPITAL B.""  ED MD-A STATED, ""I THEN CALLED (ON CALL MD-D THE GENERAL SURGEON AT HOSPITAL B) AND ON CALL MD-D ACCEPTED THE PATIENT FOR A TRANSFER.""  THE PATIENT WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL B VIA AMBULANCE.

PATIENT 1 PRESENTED TO THE ED WITH COMPLAINTS OF SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN.  THE ED MD-A DID CALL THE GENERAL SURGEON ON CALL (ON CALL MD-B) TWICE WHILE PATIENT 1 WAS IN THE ED.  ON CALL MD-B DID NOT COME TO THE ED TO EXAMINE THE PATIENT PRIOR TO BEING TRANSFERRED.

E.  AN INTERVIEW ON 2/2/17 AT 10:30 AM, WITH ON CALL MD-B THE GENERAL SURGEON ON CALL ON 1/14/17, CONFIRMED THAT (ED MD-A) DID CALL TWICE TO REVIEW THE CASE, INCLUDING THE TEST RESULTS AND (PATIENT 1'S) HISTORY OF JUST HAVING SURGERY IN NOVEMBER 2016.   ""I DID NOT COME IN AND SEE (PATIENT 1), I TOLD ED MD-A THAT AS A SURGEON THAT IT IS OUR OATH THROUGH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGERY THAT IF YOU DID THE 1ST SURGERY, THAT SURGEON USUALLY FOLLOWS UP WITH ANY COMPLICATIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE SURGERY.  THAT WAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID, INCLUDING THE PLACEMENT OF THE MESH AND WHERE THEY ANCHORED IT IN THIS CASE."" ON CALL MD-B STATED THAT HE HAD ASSISTED IN THIS TYPE OF SURGERY HERE IN THE PAST BUT DID NOT DO THIS PATIENTS SURGERY.  ""IT  IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO AT THIS HOSPITAL BUT WOULD NEED ONE OF THE OB/GYN SPECIALIST HERE TO ASSIST ME.  I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THIS PATIENT TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL SURGEON.  (ED MD-A) REVIEWED THE TEST, LAB AND SCAN RESULTS WITH ME AND THAT THERE WAS A NG TUBE PLACED, IV MEDICATION FOR COMFORT AND NAUSEA, FROM THAT INFORMATION I FELT THE PATIENT WOULD BE STABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO (HOSPITAL B).""

F.  REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S MEDICAL RECORD REVEALED IN THE NURSES NOTES THAT THE PATIENT (MDS) DATED [DATE] AT 3:55 PM WITH A COMPLAINT OF INTERMITTENT SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN WITH NAUSEA AND VOMITING.  WAS SEEN HERE FRIDAY (1/13/17) EARLY AM FOR THESE SYMPTOMS.  

ED MD-A'S NOTE REVEALED, PATIENT COMPLAINS OF CONTINUED ABDOMINAL PAIN WITH INTERMITTENT EPISODES OF VOMITING.  PATIENT WAS EVALUATED IN EMERGENCY ROOM    SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT ON 1/13/17.  PATIENT HAD NEGATIVE EXAM AND NEGATIVE PLAIN FILMS.  PATIENT HAD NONSPECIFIC BOWEL GAS PATTERN.  THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN ZOFRAN (MEDICINE FOR NAUSEA AND VOMITING) AND HAD IMPROVEMENT OF THE PAIN SYMPTOMS.  (PATIENT 1) REPORTED THAT THE PAIN WOULD RETURN AFTER SHE HAD BEEN WITHOUT VOMITING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  PAIN PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE ED FOR EVALUATION.  DENIED SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAIN OR URINARY FREQUENCY.  ""THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT (GENDER) HAD AN ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY IN NOVEMBER PERFORMED BY (OB/GYN MD-C'S PARTNER).  PATIENT REPORTS HAD MESH PLACED ALONG THE SACRUM.  PATIENT WAS HAVING PELVIC PROLAPSE SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO THE SURGERY.  PATIENT HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLICATIONS WITH THE SURGERY TO THIS POINT.""

ED MD-A'S PHYSICAL EXAM IDENTIFIED THAT PATIENT 1'S ABDOMEN WAS SOFT, HYPOACTIVE BOWEL SOUNDS (SLOW BOWEL SOUNDS), MODERATE DIFFUSE TENDERNESS WITH INCREASED TENDERNESS IN THE PERIUMBILICAL (THE BELLY BUTTON AREA) AND SUPRAPUBIC (THE FRONT BONE OF THE PELVIS) REGION MORE IN MIDLINE.  POSITIVE REBOUND TENDERNESS (PAIN UPON REMOVAL OF PRESSURE IN THE ABDOMEN). POSITIVE GUARDING (TENSING OF ABDOMINAL WALL MUSCLES TO GUARD THE ABDOMEN).  POSITIVE HEELTAP BY REPORT. (THE JARRING TO THE HEEL CAUSES ABDOMINAL PAIN). PAIN DOES NOT LOCALIZE TO THE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT.""

ED MD-A ORDERED THE FOLLOWING TESTS:
-INSERTION OF AN IV
-IV ZOFRAN FOR NAUSEA
-CBC-A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF PATIENT INCLUDING ANEMIA, INFECTION, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  RESULTS: WBC (WHITE BLOOD COUNT-SHOWS INFECTION) 14.7 HIGH [3.5-10.5]
-CMP-A COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC PROFILE USED TO MEASURE GLUCOSE/SUGAR LEVEL, ELECTROLYTES, KIDNEY  AND LIVER FUNCTION.  RESULTS: GLUCOSE 169 HIGH [65-100]; POTASSIUM 3.4 LOW [3.5-5.5]
-CRP-A C-REACTIVE PROTEIN LEVEL USED TO CHECK FOR INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY.  RESULTS: 0.3  NORMAL [0.2-0.8]
-LACTIC ACID/LACTATE- A TEST THAT CAN IDENTIFY POSSIBLE SEVERE INFECTION (SEPSIS).  RESULTS: 0.84 LOW [0.90-1.70]
-LIPASE-A TEST TO LOOK AT THE LIPASE ENZYME THAT CAN IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH THE PANCREAS. RESULTS: 111 NORMAL [70-300]
-URINALYSIS-ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE
-CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS-A SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS AREA. RESULTS: IMPRESSION: 1)SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. INTERNAL HERNIA AND/OR CLOSED-LOOP OBSTRUCTION NOT EXCLUDED. (A PROTRUSION OF AN INTERNAL ORGAN INTO THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY); 2) THICK WALLED SMALL BOWEL LOOPS IN THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT, COULD RELATE TO INFECTION/INFLAMMATION OR ISCHEMIC BOWEL (DEAD PIECE OF BOWEL); 3) MESENTERIC EDEMA (FLUID IN THE FOLD OF TISSUE THAT ATTACHES ORGANS TO THE BODY WALL) AND INTERLOOP ASCITIES (FLUID) ADJACENT TO THE OBSTRUCTED BOWEL LOOPS.; 4) ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC ASCITIES.

ED MD-A'S MEDICAL DECISION MAKING NOTE AT 8:25 PM IDENTIFIED:  THAT ON EXAM THE PATIENT HAS FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH PERITONITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE MEMBRANE PERITONEUM, THAT LINES THE INNER ABDOMINAL WALL AND COVERS THE ORGANS IN YOU ABDOMEN).  SHE HAD REBOUND TENDERNESS AND POINT TENDERNESS. CT SCAN REVEALED EVIDENCE OF SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.  THERE ARE THICKENED AREAS WITHIN THE SMALL INTESTINE SUGGESTIVE OF POSSIBLE ISCHEMIA.  I SPOKE WITH (ON CALL MD-B) AND HAD AN NG TUBE PLACED.  (ON CALL MD-B) REQUESTED PATIENT BE TRANSFERRED TO (HOSPITAL B) FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE.  I SPOKE WITH THE ON-CALL PHYSICIAN OB/GYN MD-C AT (HOSPITAL B).  (OB/GYN MD-C) REQUESTED I CONTACT THE ON-CALL GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AT HOSPITAL B.  I DID SPEAK WITH (ON CALL MD-D) AND HE HAS ACCEPTED PATIENT IN TRANSFER. I AGAIN DID SPEAK WITH (ON CALL -B) TO SEE IF PATIENT WOULD REQUIRE SURGERY PRIOR TO TRANSFER.  (ON CALL -B) REPORTS PATIENT IS STABLE FOR TRANSFER TO (HOSPITAL B).  LACTIC ACID IS NORMAL. NG OUTPUT HAS BEEN 240 CC (CUBIC CENTIMETERS) OF FLUID.  PATIENT HAS HAD 2 SEPARATE DOSES OF IV MORPHINE PRIOR TO TRANSFER.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION STATUS POST ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY NOVEMBER 2016.""

G.  REVIEW OF THE COMPLETED TRANSFER CONSENT/CERTIFICATION FORM DATED 1/14/17 AT 8:43 PM IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING:
-THE PATIENT IS STABLE SO THAT, WITHIN REASONABLE MEDICAL PROBABILITY, NO DETERIORATION OF PATIENT'S CONDITION IS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM THE TRANSFER.
-REASON FOR TRANSFER (BENEFITS)- APPROPRIATE FACILITY NOT AVAILABLE AT (THIS HOSPITAL NAME).; SPECIALIZED PHYSICIAN/DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES REQUIRED.; PATIENT IS NOT IN ACTIVE LABOR WITH IMMINENT DELIVERY/SPECIALIZED OB CARE NEEDED.; EXPECTED BENEFITS OF TREATMENT AT ANOTHER FACILITY OUTWEIGH RISKS OF TRANSFER.
-RISK OF TRANSFER- DETERIORATION IN CONDITION: RISK OF INCREASED PAIN, RISK OF ISCHEMIC BOWEL, RISK OF PERFORATION (A HOLE OPEN UP IN THE BOWEL) AND TRANSPORTATION RISK.
 
WHEN INQUIRED OF ED MD-A WHY, CONTINUITY OF CARE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A BENEFIT, ED MD-A INDICATED THAT THE SURGEON THAT ACCEPTED THE PATIENT WAS A GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AND NOT THE SURGEONS (OB/GYN MD-C AND PARTNER) THAT PERFORMED THE PREVIOUS SURGERY.  THEREFORE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE CONTINUITY OF CARE WAS NOT INDICATED TO BE IDENTIFIED.
 
H.  AN INTERVIEW WITH ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E IDENTIFIED AS THE ED MEDICAL DIRECTOR, ON 2/2/17 AT 11:30 AM STATED, PATIENT 1 HAD AN EMC DURING THE ED STAY THAT REQUIRED TREATMENT.    ""THE PATIENT NEEDED STABILIZING TREATMENT AND CARE.""  WHEN ASKED IF THE PATIENT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR TRANSFER OR TREATMENT HERE, ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E REPLIED, ""WE COULD HAVE PROVIDED THE TREATMENT HERE, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY."" WHEN ASKED IF PATIENT 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH ANESTHESIA RISK.  ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E STATED, ""I THINK A LOWER RISK PATIENT FROM ANESTHESIA POINT OF VIEW, NO HISTORY OF CARDIAC, RENAL OR PULMONARY DISEASE AND NOT OBESE.""  ""IN MY OPINION WITH THE NG TUBE, IV FLUIDS AND PAIN MANAGEMENT, I FEEL THAT (PATIENT 1) WAS STABLE FOR THE TRANSFER.""  WHEN INQUIRED OF THE RISK OF THE TRANSFER. ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E INDICATED THAT ""PERFORATION COULD OCCUR, NOT HIGHLY LIKELY OR HYPOTENSION (LOW BLOOD PRESSURE) IF TURNS SEPTIC (SYSTEMIC INFECTION), NOT HIGHLY LIKELY IN THE 60-70 MINUTES IT TAKES TO GET THERE (HOSPITAL B).

I.  REVIEW OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE GENERAL SURGEON AND THE OB/GYN PHYSICIANS REVEALED:
-ON CALL MD-B HAD PRIVILEGES TO REPAIR RECTOCELE, ENTEROCELE, CYSTOCELE, OR PELVIC PROLAPSE.
-THE 3 OB/GYN PHYSICIANS (OB/GYN MD-F, OB/GYN MD-G AND OB/GYN MD-H) ON STAFF HAD PRIVILEGES FOR RECTOCELE, ENTEROCELE, CYSTOCELE, PELVIC PROLAPSE REPAIR.

REVIEW OF THE PHYSICIAN ON-CALL LIST REVEALED THAT ON CALL MD-B AND OB/GYN MD-H WERE ON CALL.  THERE WAS A SURGICAL TEAM AND ANESTHESIA SERVICES ON CALL.  REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL LOG IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS NO SURGERY BEING PERFORMED ON 1/14/17 FROM 3:55 PM TO 8:56 PM  WHILE AT THE HOSPITAL TO PREVENT THE HOSPITAL FROM SURGICAL INTERVENTION WITHIN ITS CAPABILITIES.

J.  REVIEW OF THE ICU BED AVAILABILITY REVEALED THAT THEFACILITY HAS 9 ICU BEDS AND THEY HAD A CENSUS OF 6 IN ICU ON 1/14/17.

REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL CASE MIX FROM 7/1/16-12/31/16 REVEALED THAT THERE WERE 4 CASES OF EXPLORATORY LAPOROTOMY (SURGICAL OPERATION WHERE THE ABDOMEN IS OPENED AND THE ABDOMINAL ORGANS EXAMINED FOR INJURY OR DISEASE) WITH RESECTIONS (SURGICAL REMOVAL OF A PIECE OF BOWEL THAT IS BLOCKED OR DISEASED) PERFORMED.

REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL CASE MIX FROM 7/1/16-12/31/16 REVEALED THAT THERE WERE 23 TOTAL SURGICAL CASES PERFORMED BY THIS HOSPITALS GENERAL SURGEONS FOR THE  DIAGNOSES OF [DIAGNOSES REDACTED][A PAINFUL OBSTRUCTION OF THE INTESTINE].

THIS SURGICAL MIX IDENTIFIES THAT THE FACILITY HAD THE CAPABILITY TO TREAT PATIENT 1, THEREFORE NOT REQUIRING A TRANSFER TO (HOSPITAL B).

I.  REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S INFORMATION FROM THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL (HOSPITAL B) MEDICAL RECORD REVEALED:
-PATIENT 1 WAS ADMITTED [DATE] AT 22:34 (10:34 PM) FOR DIRECT ADMISSION TO THE SURGICAL FLOOR.
-PRE OPERATIVE HISTORY AND PHYSICAL DATED 1/14/17 AT 23:18 (11:18 PM) BY ON CALL MD-D STATED, ""I THINK CLEARLY THIS PATIENT DOES NEED TO GO TO THE OR (SURGERY).  RECOMMENDED PROCEEDING WITH EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.""
-PER THE ANESTHESIA RECORD, PATIENT 1 ARRIVED IN THE SURGERY SUITE AT 2340 (11:40 PM) ON 1/14/17 FOR THE EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.

THE ON CALL MD-D WAS A GENERAL SURGEON THAT PREPARED PATIENT 1 FOR SURGERY WITHIN 1 HOUR OF ARRIVAL TO HOSPITAL B.

Based on record review, review of the facility Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) policies, staff and provider interviews the facility failed to provide 1 (Patient 1) of 21 sampled patients an appropriate transfer due to this facility had the capability of providing the potentially necessary surgery needed to treat Patient 1's Emergency Medical Condition (EMC). Patient 1's Medical Screening Exam (MSE) identified an EMC requiring potential surgical intervention.  The facility had a general surgeon and obstetrics/gynecology, anesthesia staff on call, a surgical team available and Intensive Care Beds (ICU) available, and yet the patient was not seen by a surgeon and transferred placing the patients health at risk at the time of the transfer.  The total sample size was 21.

Findings are:

A.   Review of facility document titled ""Medical Staff Rules and Regulations"" revised February 2016 under the section titled ""Emergency Treatment and Stabilization"" states that ""Persons with emergency medical conditions will be treated within the capability of the Hospital's dedicated emergency department (ED) and their condition stabilized, or the person will be transferred to another facility in accordance with Hospital policy.""  

B.  Review of facility policy titled ""EMTALA-Patient Screening, Treatment and Transfer Requirements Under Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"" dated 3-19-15 states, ""An individual in an unstable EMC may be transferred only by an ""appropriate transfer"" as that term is defined by EMTALA, requiring: a)The Hospital shall provide medical treatment within its capability that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child.""

C.   Review of the hospital's Medicare Database Worksheet verified by the hospital quality coordinator on 2/1/17 revealed the hospital's capabilities include a dedicated Emergency Department, non-surgical cardiac and medical/surgical ICU, inpatient and outpatient surgical services and obstetric services.

D.  An interview on 2/1/17 at 1:30 PM, with ED MD-A the physician attending to Patient 1 in the ED on 1/14/17, confirmed that the patient had an EMC at the time of discharge. ED MD-A stated, ""I felt that the patient was stable due to having placed an IV (intravenous), a NG (naso-gastric tube -used to decompress the stomach) and provided treatment including lab, xrays and medication.  I did believe that at the time of transfer the patient (Patient 1) required possible immediate surgical intervention due to the scan showed possible small bowel obstruction and possible signs of peritonitis (inflammation of the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs)."" ED MD-A did identify that the hospital has a general surgeon's on call, and I did visit with (On Call MD-B the general surgeon on call on 1/14/17) on the phone about the case twice that evening at 6:10 PM and 8:05 PM. ""I reviewed the numbers (lab values received), the scan report, and the history of Patient 1 having had surgery in November of 2016 at (Hospital B-65 miles away) for abdominal sacral colpopexy (An abdominal surgery which mesh is stitched into the top of the vagina and attached to a strong ligament overlying the sacrum (tail bone) to correct a prolapse of the pelvic organs.)  On Call MD-B told me that it is the advice of the American College of General Surgeons, that for 90 days after surgery, the surgeon is responsible for complications from that surgery and On Call MD-B thought that was the case.""  ED MD-A did call the surgeon (OB/GYN MD-C an Obstetrics and Gynecology [OB/GYN] Specialist) at Hospital B that was on call for the surgeon that performed the November 2016 surgery.  ED MD-A stated, ""(OB/GYN MD-C) stated that (she) assisted with Patient 1's case in November.  OB/GYN MD-C stated that they do not do surgery for bowel obstruction, that would be referred to their general surgeon (On Call MD-D) at Hospital B.""  ED MD-A stated, ""I then called (On Call MD-D the general surgeon at Hospital B) and On Call MD-D accepted the patient for a transfer.""  The patient was then transferred to Hospital B via ambulance.

E.  An interview on 2/2/17 at 10:30 AM, with On Call MD-B the general surgeon on call on 1/14/17, confirmed that (ED MD-A) did call twice to review the case, including the test results and (Patient 1's) history of just having surgery in November 2016.   ""I did not come in and see (Patient 1), I told ED MD-A that as a surgeon that it is our oath through the American College of Surgery that if you did the 1st surgery, that surgeon usually follows up with any complications within 90 days of the surgery.  That way they know exactly what they did, including the placement of the mesh and where they anchored it in this case."" On Call MD-B stated that he had assisted in this type of surgery here in the past but did not do this patients surgery.  ""It  is something we can do at this hospital but would need one of the OB/GYN specialist here to assist me.  I felt that it would be better for the continuity of care for this patient to return to the original surgeon.  (ED MD-A) reviewed the test, lab and scan results with me and that there was a NG tube placed, IV medication for comfort and nausea, from that information I felt the patient would be stable to be transferred to (Hospital B).""

F.  Review of Patient 1's medical record revealed in the nurses notes that the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 3:55 PM with a complaint of intermittent severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.  Was seen here Friday (1/13/17) early AM for these symptoms.  

ED MD-A's note revealed, Patient complains of continued abdominal pain with intermittent episodes of vomiting.  Patient was evaluated in emergency room    shortly after midnight on 1/13/17.  Patient had negative exam and negative plain films.  Patient had nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  The patient was given Zofran (medicine for nausea and vomiting) and had improvement of the pain symptoms.  (Patient 1) reported that the pain would return after she had been without vomiting for a period of time.  Pain persisted throughout the day and patient presented to the ED for evaluation.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain or urinary frequency.  ""The patient reported that (gender) had an abdominal sacral colpopexy in November performed by (OB/GYN MD-C's partner).  Patient reports had mesh placed along the sacrum.  Patient was having pelvic prolapse symptoms prior to the surgery.  Patient has not had any complications with the surgery to this point.""

ED MD-A's physical exam identified that Patient 1's abdomen was soft, hypoactive bowel sounds (slow bowel sounds), moderate diffuse tenderness with increased tenderness in the periumbilical (the belly button area) and suprapubic (the front bone of the pelvis) region more in midline.  Positive rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure in the abdomen). Positive guarding (tensing of abdominal wall muscles to guard the abdomen).  Positive heeltap by report. (the jarring to the heel causes abdominal pain). Pain does not localize to the right lower quadrant.""

ED MD-A ordered the following tests:
-insertion of an IV
-IV zofran for nausea
-CBC-a complete blood count to evaluate the overall health of patient including anemia, infection, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  RESULTS: WBC (white blood count-shows infection) 14.7 High [3.5-10.5]
-CMP-a comprehensive metabolic profile used to measure glucose/sugar level, electrolytes, kidney  and liver function.  RESULTS: Glucose 169 High [65-100]; Potassium 3.4 Low [3.5-5.5]
-CRP-a c-reactive protein level used to check for inflammation in the body.  RESULTS: 0.3  Normal [0.2-0.8]
-Lactic Acid/Lactate- a test that can identify possible severe infection (sepsis).  RESULTS: 0.84 low [0.90-1.70]
-Lipase-a test to look at the lipase enzyme that can identify possible issues with the pancreas. RESULTS: 111 Normal [70-300]
-Urinalysis-essentially negative
-CT Abdomen/pelvis-a scan of the abdomen and pelvis area. RESULTS: Impression: 1)small bowel obstruction. Internal hernia and/or closed-loop obstruction not excluded. (a protrusion of an internal organ into the abdominal cavity); 2) Thick walled small bowel loops in the left lower quadrant, could relate to infection/inflammation or ischemic bowel (dead piece of bowel); 3) Mesenteric edema (fluid in the fold of tissue that attaches organs to the body wall) and interloop ascities (fluid) adjacent to the obstructed bowel loops.; 4) Abdominal and pelvic ascities.

ED MD-A's Medical Decision Making Note at 8:25 PM identified:  That on exam the patient has findings consistent with peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane peritoneum, that lines the inner abdominal wall and covers the organs in you abdomen).  She had rebound tenderness and point tenderness. CT scan revealed evidence of small bowel obstruction.  There are thickened areas within the small intestine suggestive of possible ischemia.  I spoke with (On Call MD-B) and had an NG tube placed.  (On Call MD-B) requested patient be transferred to (Hospital B) for continuity of care.  I spoke with the on-call physician OB/GYN MD-C at (Hospital B).  (OB/GYN MD-C) requested I contact the on-call General surgeon (On Call MD-D) at Hospital B.  I did speak with (On Call MD-D) and he has accepted patient in transfer. I again did speak with (On Call -B) to see if patient would require surgery prior to transfer.  (On Call -B) reports patient is stable for transfer to (Hospital B).  Lactic acid is normal. NG output has been 240 cc (cubic centimeters) of fluid.  Patient has had 2 separate doses of IV morphine prior to transfer.  Final diagnosis: Small Bowel obstruction status post abdominal sacral colpopexy November 2016.""

G.  Review of the completed Transfer Consent/Certification form dated 1/14/17 at 8:43 PM identified the following:
-The patient is stable so that, within reasonable medical probability, no deterioration of patient's condition is likely to result from the transfer.
-Reason for transfer (benefits)- Appropriate facility not available at (this hospital name).; Specialized physician/diagnostic services required.; Patient is not in active labor with imminent delivery/specialized OB care needed.; Expected benefits of treatment at another facility outweigh risks of transfer.
-Risk of transfer- Deterioration in condition: risk of increased pain, risk of ischemic bowel, risk of perforation (a hole open up in the bowel) and transportation risk.
 
When inquired of ED MD-A why, Continuity of care was not identified as a benefit, ED MD-A indicated that the surgeon that accepted the patient was a general surgeon (On Call MD-D) and not the surgeons (OB/GYN MD-C and partner) that performed the previous surgery.  Therefore didn't feel that the continuity of care was not indicated to be identified.

H.  An interview with ED Med Director MD-E identified as the ED medical director, on 2/2/17 at 11:30 AM stated, Patient 1 had an EMC during the ED stay that required treatment.    ""The patient needed stabilizing treatment and care.""  When asked if the patient was appropriate for transfer or treatment here, ED Med Director MD-E replied, ""We could have provided the treatment here, we have the capability."" When asked if Patient 1 would have been a high anesthesia risk.  ED Med Director MD-E stated, ""I think a lower risk patient from anesthesia point of view, no history of cardiac, renal or pulmonary disease and not obese.""  ""In my opinion with the NG tube, IV fluids and pain management, I feel that (Patient 1) was stable for the transfer.""  When inquired of the risk of the transfer. ED Med Director MD-E indicated that ""perforation could occur, not highly likely or Hypotension (low blood pressure) if turns septic (systemic infection), not highly likely in the 60-70 minutes it takes to get there (Hospital B).

I.  Review of the privileges of the general surgeon and the OB/Gyn physicians revealed:
-On Call MD-B had privileges to repair rectocele, enterocele, cystocele, or pelvic prolapse.
-The 3 OB/GYN physicians (OB/GYN MD-F, OB/GYN MD-G and OB/GYN MD-H) on staff had privileges for rectocele, enterocele, cystocele, pelvic prolapse repair.

Review of the Physician on-call list revealed that On Call MD-B and OB/GYN MD-H were on call.  There was a surgical team and anesthesia services on call.  Review of the Surgical Log identified that there was no surgery being performed on 1/14/17 from 3:55 PM to 8:56 PM  while at the hospital to prevent the hospital from surgical intervention within its capabilities.

J.  Review of the ICU bed availability revealed that thefacility has 9 ICU beds and they had a census of 6 in ICU on 1/14/17.

Review of the surgical case mix from 7/1/16-12/31/16 revealed that there were 4 cases of exploratory laporotomy (surgical operation where the abdomen is opened and the abdominal organs examined for injury or disease) with resections (surgical removal of a piece of bowel that is blocked or diseased) performed.

Review of the surgical case mix from 7/1/16-12/31/16 revealed that there were 23 total surgical cases performed by this hospitals general surgeons for the  diagnoses of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED][a painful obstruction of the intestine].

This surgical mix identifies that the facility had the capability to treat Patient 1, therefore not requiring a transfer to (Hospital B).

I.  Review of Patient 1's information from the receiving hospital (Hospital B) medical record revealed:
-Patient 1 was admitted [DATE] at 22:34 (10:34 PM) for direct admission to the surgical floor.
-Pre operative History and Physical dated 1/14/17 at 23:18 (11:18 PM) by On Call MD-D stated, ""I think clearly this patient does need to go to the OR (surgery).  Recommended proceeding with exploratory laparotomy.""
-Per the Anesthesia Record, Patient 1 arrived in the surgery suite at 2340 (11:40 PM) on 1/14/17 for the exploratory laparotomy.

The On Call MD-D was a general surgeon that prepared Patient 1 for surgery within 1 hour of arrival to Hospital B.  Review of the sending hospital (Hospital A) surgical case mix identifies that Hospital A had the capability and capacity to treat Patient 1, therefore Patient 1 would not have required a transfer to (Hospital B) for stabilization of the EMC.

BASED ON RECORD REVIEW, REVIEW OF THE FACILITY EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND LABOR ACT (EMTALA) POLICIES, STAFF AND PROVIDER INTERVIEWS THE FACILITY FAILED TO PROVIDE 1 (PATIENT 1) OF 21 SAMPLED PATIENTS AN APPROPRIATE TRANSFER DUE TO THIS FACILITY HAD THE CAPABILITY OF PROVIDING THE POTENTIALLY NECESSARY SURGERY NEEDED TO TREAT PATIENT 1'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION (EMC). PATIENT 1'S MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM (MSE) IDENTIFIED AN EMC REQUIRING POTENTIAL SURGICAL INTERVENTION.  THE FACILITY HAD A GENERAL SURGEON AND OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY, ANESTHESIA STAFF ON CALL, A SURGICAL TEAM AVAILABLE AND INTENSIVE CARE BEDS (ICU) AVAILABLE, AND YET THE PATIENT WAS NOT SEEN BY A SURGEON AND TRANSFERRED PLACING THE PATIENTS HEALTH AT RISK AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER.  THE TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE WAS 21.

FINDINGS ARE:

A.   REVIEW OF FACILITY DOCUMENT TITLED ""MEDICAL STAFF RULES AND REGULATIONS"" REVISED FEBRUARY 2016 UNDER THE SECTION TITLED ""EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND STABILIZATION"" STATES THAT ""PERSONS WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS WILL BE TREATED WITHIN THE CAPABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL'S DEDICATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) AND THEIR CONDITION STABILIZED, OR THE PERSON WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOSPITAL POLICY.""  

B.  REVIEW OF FACILITY POLICY TITLED ""EMTALA-PATIENT SCREENING, TREATMENT AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS UNDER EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND "" DATED 3-19-15 STATES, ""AN INDIVIDUAL IN AN UNSTABLE EMC MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY BY AN ""APPROPRIATE TRANSFER"" AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED BY EMTALA, REQUIRING: A)THE HOSPITAL SHALL PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN ITS CAPABILITY THAT MINIMIZES THE RISKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S HEALTH AND, IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR, THE HEALTH OF THE UNBORN CHILD.""

C.   REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE DATABASE WORKSHEET VERIFIED BY THE HOSPITAL QUALITY COORDINATOR ON 2/1/17 REVEALED THE HOSPITAL'S CAPABILITIES INCLUDE A DEDICATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, NON-SURGICAL CARDIAC AND MEDICAL/SURGICAL ICU, INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SURGICAL SERVICES AND OBSTETRIC SERVICES.

D.  AN INTERVIEW ON 2/1/17 AT 1:30 PM, WITH ED MD-A THE PHYSICIAN ATTENDING TO PATIENT 1 IN THE ED ON 1/14/17, CONFIRMED THAT THE PATIENT HAD AN EMC AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. ED MD-A STATED, ""I FELT THAT THE PATIENT WAS STABLE DUE TO HAVING PLACED AN IV (INTRAVENOUS), A NG (NASO-GASTRIC TUBE -USED TO DECOMPRESS THE STOMACH) AND PROVIDED TREATMENT INCLUDING LAB, XRAYS AND MEDICATION.  I DID BELIEVE THAT AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER THE PATIENT (PATIENT 1) REQUIRED POSSIBLE IMMEDIATE SURGICAL INTERVENTION DUE TO THE SCAN SHOWED POSSIBLE SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AND POSSIBLE SIGNS OF PERITONITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE THIN TISSUE THAT LINES THE INNER WALL OF THE ABDOMEN AND COVERS MOST OF THE ABDOMINAL ORGANS)."" ED MD-A DID IDENTIFY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS A GENERAL SURGEON'S ON CALL, AND I DID VISIT WITH (ON CALL MD-B THE GENERAL SURGEON ON CALL ON 1/14/17) ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE CASE TWICE THAT EVENING AT 6:10 PM AND 8:05 PM. ""I REVIEWED THE NUMBERS (LAB VALUES RECEIVED), THE SCAN REPORT, AND THE HISTORY OF PATIENT 1 HAVING HAD SURGERY IN NOVEMBER OF 2016 AT (HOSPITAL B-65 MILES AWAY) FOR ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY (AN ABDOMINAL SURGERY WHICH MESH IS STITCHED INTO THE TOP OF THE VAGINA AND ATTACHED TO A STRONG LIGAMENT OVERLYING THE SACRUM (TAIL BONE) TO CORRECT A PROLAPSE OF THE PELVIC ORGANS.)  ON CALL MD-B TOLD ME THAT IT IS THE ADVICE OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF GENERAL SURGEONS, THAT FOR 90 DAYS AFTER SURGERY, THE SURGEON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLICATIONS FROM THAT SURGERY AND ON CALL MD-B THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CASE.""  ED MD-A DID CALL THE SURGEON (OB/GYN MD-C AN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY [OB/GYN] SPECIALIST) AT HOSPITAL B THAT WAS ON CALL FOR THE SURGEON THAT PERFORMED THE NOVEMBER 2016 SURGERY.  ED MD-A STATED, ""(OB/GYN MD-C) STATED THAT (SHE) ASSISTED WITH PATIENT 1'S CASE IN NOVEMBER.  OB/GYN MD-C STATED THAT THEY DO NOT DO SURGERY FOR BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, THAT WOULD BE REFERRED TO THEIR GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AT HOSPITAL B.""  ED MD-A STATED, ""I THEN CALLED (ON CALL MD-D THE GENERAL SURGEON AT HOSPITAL B) AND ON CALL MD-D ACCEPTED THE PATIENT FOR A TRANSFER.""  THE PATIENT WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL B VIA AMBULANCE.

E.  AN INTERVIEW ON 2/2/17 AT 10:30 AM, WITH ON CALL MD-B THE GENERAL SURGEON ON CALL ON 1/14/17, CONFIRMED THAT (ED MD-A) DID CALL TWICE TO REVIEW THE CASE, INCLUDING THE TEST RESULTS AND (PATIENT 1'S) HISTORY OF JUST HAVING SURGERY IN NOVEMBER 2016.   ""I DID NOT COME IN AND SEE (PATIENT 1), I TOLD ED MD-A THAT AS A SURGEON THAT IT IS OUR OATH THROUGH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGERY THAT IF YOU DID THE 1ST SURGERY, THAT SURGEON USUALLY FOLLOWS UP WITH ANY COMPLICATIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE SURGERY.  THAT WAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID, INCLUDING THE PLACEMENT OF THE MESH AND WHERE THEY ANCHORED IT IN THIS CASE."" ON CALL MD-B STATED THAT HE HAD ASSISTED IN THIS TYPE OF SURGERY HERE IN THE PAST BUT DID NOT DO THIS PATIENTS SURGERY.  ""IT  IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO AT THIS HOSPITAL BUT WOULD NEED ONE OF THE OB/GYN SPECIALIST HERE TO ASSIST ME.  I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THIS PATIENT TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL SURGEON.  (ED MD-A) REVIEWED THE TEST, LAB AND SCAN RESULTS WITH ME AND THAT THERE WAS A NG TUBE PLACED, IV MEDICATION FOR COMFORT AND NAUSEA, FROM THAT INFORMATION I FELT THE PATIENT WOULD BE STABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO (HOSPITAL B).""

F.  REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S MEDICAL RECORD REVEALED IN THE NURSES NOTES THAT THE PATIENT (MDS) DATED [DATE] AT 3:55 PM WITH A COMPLAINT OF INTERMITTENT SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN WITH NAUSEA AND VOMITING.  WAS SEEN HERE FRIDAY (1/13/17) EARLY AM FOR THESE SYMPTOMS.  

ED MD-A'S NOTE REVEALED, PATIENT COMPLAINS OF CONTINUED ABDOMINAL PAIN WITH INTERMITTENT EPISODES OF VOMITING.  PATIENT WAS EVALUATED IN EMERGENCY ROOM    SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT ON 1/13/17.  PATIENT HAD NEGATIVE EXAM AND NEGATIVE PLAIN FILMS.  PATIENT HAD NONSPECIFIC BOWEL GAS PATTERN.  THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN ZOFRAN (MEDICINE FOR NAUSEA AND VOMITING) AND HAD IMPROVEMENT OF THE PAIN SYMPTOMS.  (PATIENT 1) REPORTED THAT THE PAIN WOULD RETURN AFTER SHE HAD BEEN WITHOUT VOMITING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  PAIN PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE ED FOR EVALUATION.  DENIED SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAIN OR URINARY FREQUENCY.  ""THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT (GENDER) HAD AN ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY IN NOVEMBER PERFORMED BY (OB/GYN MD-C'S PARTNER).  PATIENT REPORTS HAD MESH PLACED ALONG THE SACRUM.  PATIENT WAS HAVING PELVIC PROLAPSE SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO THE SURGERY.  PATIENT HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLICATIONS WITH THE SURGERY TO THIS POINT.""

ED MD-A'S PHYSICAL EXAM IDENTIFIED THAT PATIENT 1'S ABDOMEN WAS SOFT, HYPOACTIVE BOWEL SOUNDS (SLOW BOWEL SOUNDS), MODERATE DIFFUSE TENDERNESS WITH INCREASED TENDERNESS IN THE PERIUMBILICAL (THE BELLY BUTTON AREA) AND SUPRAPUBIC (THE FRONT BONE OF THE PELVIS) REGION MORE IN MIDLINE.  POSITIVE REBOUND TENDERNESS (PAIN UPON REMOVAL OF PRESSURE IN THE ABDOMEN). POSITIVE GUARDING (TENSING OF ABDOMINAL WALL MUSCLES TO GUARD THE ABDOMEN).  POSITIVE HEELTAP BY REPORT. (THE JARRING TO THE HEEL CAUSES ABDOMINAL PAIN). PAIN DOES NOT LOCALIZE TO THE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT.""

ED MD-A ORDERED THE FOLLOWING TESTS:
-INSERTION OF AN IV
-IV ZOFRAN FOR NAUSEA
-CBC-A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF PATIENT INCLUDING ANEMIA, INFECTION, [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  RESULTS: WBC (WHITE BLOOD COUNT-SHOWS INFECTION) 14.7 HIGH [3.5-10.5]
-CMP-A COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC PROFILE USED TO MEASURE GLUCOSE/SUGAR LEVEL, ELECTROLYTES, KIDNEY  AND LIVER FUNCTION.  RESULTS: GLUCOSE 169 HIGH [65-100]; POTASSIUM 3.4 LOW [3.5-5.5]

-URINALYSIS-ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE
-CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS-A SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS AREA. RESULTS: IMPRESSION: 1)SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. INTERNAL HERNIA AND/OR CLOSED-LOOP OBSTRUCTION NOT EXCLUDED. (A PROTRUSION OF AN INTERNAL ORGAN INTO THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY); 2) THICK WALLED SMALL BOWEL LOOPS IN THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT, COULD RELATE TO INFECTION/INFLAMMATION OR ISCHEMIC BOWEL (DEAD PIECE OF BOWEL); 3) MESENTERIC EDEMA (FLUID IN THE FOLD OF TISSUE THAT ATTACHES ORGANS TO THE BODY WALL) AND INTERLOOP ASCITIES (FLUID) ADJACENT TO THE OBSTRUCTED BOWEL LOOPS.; 4) ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC ASCITIES.

ED MD-A'S MEDICAL DECISION MAKING NOTE AT 8:25 PM IDENTIFIED:  THAT ON EXAM THE PATIENT HAS FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH PERITONITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE MEMBRANE PERITONEUM, THAT LINES THE INNER ABDOMINAL WALL AND COVERS THE ORGANS IN YOU ABDOMEN).  SHE HAD REBOUND TENDERNESS AND POINT TENDERNESS. CT SCAN REVEALED EVIDENCE OF SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.  THERE ARE THICKENED AREAS WITHIN THE SMALL INTESTINE SUGGESTIVE OF POSSIBLE ISCHEMIA.  I SPOKE WITH (ON CALL MD-B) AND HAD AN NG TUBE PLACED.  (ON CALL MD-B) REQUESTED PATIENT BE TRANSFERRED TO (HOSPITAL B) FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE.  I SPOKE WITH THE ON-CALL PHYSICIAN OB/GYN MD-C AT (HOSPITAL B).  (OB/GYN MD-C) REQUESTED I CONTACT THE ON-CALL GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AT HOSPITAL B.  I DID SPEAK WITH (ON CALL MD-D) AND HE HAS ACCEPTED PATIENT IN TRANSFER. I AGAIN DID SPEAK WITH (ON CALL -B) TO SEE IF PATIENT WOULD REQUIRE SURGERY PRIOR TO TRANSFER.  (ON CALL -B) REPORTS PATIENT IS STABLE FOR TRANSFER TO (HOSPITAL B).  LACTIC ACID IS NORMAL. NG OUTPUT HAS BEEN 240 CC (CUBIC CENTIMETERS) OF FLUID.  PATIENT HAS HAD 2 SEPARATE DOSES OF IV MORPHINE PRIOR TO TRANSFER.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION STATUS POST ABDOMINAL SACRAL COLPOPEXY NOVEMBER 2016.""

G.  REVIEW OF THE COMPLETED TRANSFER CONSENT/CERTIFICATION FORM DATED 1/14/17 AT 8:43 PM IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING:
-THE PATIENT IS STABLE SO THAT, WITHIN REASONABLE MEDICAL PROBABILITY, NO DETERIORATION OF PATIENT'S CONDITION IS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM THE TRANSFER.
-REASON FOR TRANSFER (BENEFITS)- APPROPRIATE FACILITY NOT AVAILABLE AT (THIS HOSPITAL NAME).; SPECIALIZED PHYSICIAN/DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES REQUIRED.; PATIENT IS NOT IN ACTIVE LABOR WITH IMMINENT DELIVERY/SPECIALIZED OB CARE NEEDED.; EXPECTED BENEFITS OF TREATMENT AT ANOTHER FACILITY OUTWEIGH RISKS OF TRANSFER.
-RISK OF TRANSFER- DETERIORATION IN CONDITION: RISK OF INCREASED PAIN, RISK OF ISCHEMIC BOWEL, RISK OF PERFORATION (A HOLE OPEN UP IN THE BOWEL) AND TRANSPORTATION RISK.
 
WHEN INQUIRED OF ED MD-A WHY, CONTINUITY OF CARE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A BENEFIT, ED MD-A INDICATED THAT THE SURGEON THAT ACCEPTED THE PATIENT WAS A GENERAL SURGEON (ON CALL MD-D) AND NOT THE SURGEONS (OB/GYN MD-C AND PARTNER) THAT PERFORMED THE PREVIOUS SURGERY.  THEREFORE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE CONTINUITY OF CARE WAS NOT INDICATED TO BE IDENTIFIED.

H.  AN INTERVIEW WITH ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E IDENTIFIED AS THE ED MEDICAL DIRECTOR, ON 2/2/17 AT 11:30 AM STATED, PATIENT 1 HAD AN EMC DURING THE ED STAY THAT REQUIRED TREATMENT.    ""THE PATIENT NEEDED STABILIZING TREATMENT AND CARE.""  WHEN ASKED IF THE PATIENT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR TRANSFER OR TREATMENT HERE, ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E REPLIED, ""WE COULD HAVE PROVIDED THE TREATMENT HERE, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY."" WHEN ASKED IF PATIENT 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH ANESTHESIA RISK.  ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E STATED, ""I THINK A LOWER RISK PATIENT FROM ANESTHESIA POINT OF VIEW, NO HISTORY OF CARDIAC, RENAL OR PULMONARY DISEASE AND NOT OBESE.""  ""IN MY OPINION WITH THE NG TUBE, IV FLUIDS AND PAIN MANAGEMENT, I FEEL THAT (PATIENT 1) WAS STABLE FOR THE TRANSFER.""  WHEN INQUIRED OF THE RISK OF THE TRANSFER. ED MED DIRECTOR MD-E INDICATED THAT ""PERFORATION COULD OCCUR, NOT HIGHLY LIKELY OR HYPOTENSION (LOW BLOOD PRESSURE) IF TURNS SEPTIC (SYSTEMIC INFECTION), NOT HIGHLY LIKELY IN THE 60-70 MINUTES IT TAKES TO GET THERE (HOSPITAL B).

I.  REVIEW OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE GENERAL SURGEON AND THE OB/GYN PHYSICIANS REVEALED:
-ON CALL MD-B HAD PRIVILEGES TO REPAIR RECTOCELE, ENTEROCELE, CYSTOCELE, OR PELVIC PROLAPSE.
-THE 3 OB/GYN PHYSICIANS (OB/GYN MD-F, OB/GYN MD-G AND OB/GYN MD-H) ON STAFF HAD PRIVILEGES FOR RECTOCELE, ENTEROCELE, CYSTOCELE, PELVIC PROLAPSE REPAIR.

REVIEW OF THE PHYSICIAN ON-CALL LIST REVEALED THAT ON CALL MD-B AND OB/GYN MD-H WERE ON CALL.  THERE WAS A SURGICAL TEAM AND ANESTHESIA SERVICES ON CALL.  REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL LOG IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS NO SURGERY BEING PERFORMED ON 1/14/17 FROM 3:55 PM TO 8:56 PM  WHILE AT THE HOSPITAL TO PREVENT THE HOSPITAL FROM SURGICAL INTERVENTION WITHIN ITS CAPABILITIES.

J.  REVIEW OF THE ICU BED AVAILABILITY REVEALED THAT THEFACILITY HAS 9 ICU BEDS AND THEY HAD A CENSUS OF 6 IN ICU ON 1/14/17.

REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL CASE MIX FROM 7/1/16-12/31/16 REVEALED THAT THERE WERE 4 CASES OF EXPLORATORY LAPOROTOMY (SURGICAL OPERATION WHERE THE ABDOMEN IS OPENED AND THE ABDOMINAL ORGANS EXAMINED FOR INJURY OR DISEASE) WITH RESECTIONS (SURGICAL REMOVAL OF A PIECE OF BOWEL THAT IS BLOCKED OR DISEASED) PERFORMED.

REVIEW OF THE SURGICAL CASE MIX FROM 7/1/16-12/31/16 REVEALED THAT THERE WERE 23 TOTAL SURGICAL CASES PERFORMED BY THIS HOSPITALS GENERAL SURGEONS FOR THE  DIAGNOSES OF [DIAGNOSES REDACTED][A PAINFUL OBSTRUCTION OF THE INTESTINE].

THIS SURGICAL MIX IDENTIFIES THAT THE FACILITY HAD THE CAPABILITY TO TREAT PATIENT 1, THEREFORE NOT REQUIRING A TRANSFER TO (HOSPITAL B).

I.  REVIEW OF PATIENT 1'S INFORMATION FROM THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL (HOSPITAL B) MEDICAL RECORD REVEALED:
-PATIENT 1 WAS ADMITTED [DATE] AT 22:34 (10:34 PM) FOR DIRECT ADMISSION TO THE SURGICAL FLOOR.
-PRE OPERATIVE HISTORY AND PHYSICAL DATED 1/14/17 AT 23:18 (11:18 PM) BY ON CALL MD-D STATED, ""I THINK CLEARLY THIS PATIENT DOES NEED TO GO TO THE OR (SURGERY).  RECOMMENDED PROCEEDING WITH EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.""
-PER THE ANESTHESIA RECORD, PATIENT 1 ARRIVED IN THE SURGERY SUITE AT 2340 (11:40 PM) ON 1/14/17 FOR THE EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.

THE ON CALL MD-D WAS A GENERAL SURGEON THAT PREPARED PATIENT 1 FOR SURGERY WITHIN 1 HOUR OF ARRIVAL TO HOSPITAL B.

Based on medical record (MR) review, document review, and interview, the facility did not ensure the following: 1) in 1 of 12 MRs reviewed (for patients requiring on call physician services), the on-call provider refused to make an in-person appearance to evaluate and treat an unstable individual. 2) In 4 of 12 MRs reviewed (for patients requiring on-call physician services), the on-call provider did not respond timely to emergency department (ED) physician's calls. 3) The hospital on-call list for surgeons does not consistently identify the individual physician who is responsible for call. 4) The hospital policy and procedure (P&P) for on-call physicians did not clearly outline the duties and responsibilities of the physician on-call and did not address all regulatory requirements. These lapses could lead to untoward patient outcomes.

Findings regarding (1) above include:

-- Review of Patient #1's MR, the Patient was brought to the ED (via ambulance) on 6/5/17 at 10:45 pm after a motor vehicle accident with loss of consciousness. He was triaged as a level 1 (on 1-5 scale, 1= requires immediate life-saving intervention). At 11:51 pm, the on-call surgeon, Staff B was called. Staff were unable to reach him/her. However, at 12:07 am (on 6/6/17), documentation reveals Staff A (ED Physician) spoke to an on-call surgeon, Staff C (from Staff B's surgical group.) Staff C refused to come to the ED to evaluate the patient. He/she instructed Staff C to transfer Patient #1 to the local trauma center (Hospital A). 

-- Per review of the hospital's P&P titled ""EMTALA: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act- Screening, Stabilization, Management of Transfers and Recordkeeping; Reporting Suspected EMTALA Violations,"" dated 3/16/17, ""When a physician is on call ... it is not acceptable to refer or transfer unstable cases ... the physician must come to the hospital to examine the individual.""

-- Per interview of Staff A on 7/28/17 at 1:00 pm, Patient #1 had severe back pain, hypotension (low blood pressure), and positive loss of consciousness. When he/she asked the on call surgeon (Staff C) to come in to examine Patient #1, he/she refused and told Staff A the patient needed to be sent to a trauma center. 

-- Per interview of Staff C on 7/28/17 at 2:15 pm, regarding Patient #1, he/she was paged and responded. After Staff A explained the patient case he/she recommended to ""resuscitate the patient and transfer to the trauma center."" The patient needed critical care. He/she stated he did not refuse to see the patient but ""wanted the patient resuscitated and transferred."" He did not come in to see the patient.

Findings regarding (2) above include:

-- Per review of the facility's P&P titled ""EMTALA: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act- Screening, Stabilization, Management of Transfers and Recordkeeping; Reporting Suspected EMTALA Violations,"" dated 3/16/17, it indicated the on-call physicians' responsibility to respond, examine and treat emergency patients is set forth in the facility's Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. 

-- Review of the facility's ""Medical Staff Policies (Rules and Regulations)"" last revised 6/2017, revealed that the member on call is to respond to the ED when requested by the ED practitioner by telephone call within 20 minutes. In addition, response time in emergency situations surgeons, anesthetists and obstetrician must be in the physical presence of the patient within 30 minutes.

-- Per review of Patient #2's MR, on 6/5/17 at 8:13 am, she presented to the ED (via ambulance) with abdominal pain and hypotension. She was triaged as a level 2 (condition has potential to threaten life, limb, visual function, requires rapid medical intervention, should not wait to be seen). At 8:15 am, Staff D evaluated the patient. At 11:13 am, Staff D (ED Physician) discussed the patient with on-call surgeon (Staff C) and he agreed to see the patient. At 12:43 pm (1 hour and 30 minutes later), Staff C arrived at the ED to evaluate Patient #2. 

-- Per review of Patient #3's MR, on 5/8/17 at 3:07 pm, he presented to the ED with a right thumb traumatic amputation. He was triaged as a level 2. At 3:34 pm, Staff E (ED Physician) called the on-call provider (Staff F) and left a message. At 3:51 pm, another message was left. At 4:40 pm (59 minutes later), Staff F, the on-call provider called back. (Contact was made with another facility at 4:05 pm. That facility called back at 4:15 pm and after discussion indicated Patient #3's thumb could not be reattached so patient should stay there.) 

-- Per review of Patient #5's MR, on 3/23/17 at 1:50 am, she presented to the ED with abdominal and groin pain. She was triaged as a level 3 (require two or more resources, but less urgent). At 5:28 am, Staff G called the on-call surgeon (Staff C). Staff C responded and stated he/she understood the patient needed surgery and he/she would make a few phone calls. At 5:40 am (12 minutes later), Staff C telephoned and stated he/she would see the patient in the hospital and agreed to admit the patient. At 8:46 am (3 hours and 6 minutes later), the patient was taken to surgery by Staff H (Surgeon). Consultation documentation revealed the on-call surgeon (Staff C) did not present to the hospital ED but indicated he would meet Staff H in the operating room. 

-- Per review of Patient #4's MR, on 7/3/17 at 9:29 am, he presented to the ED (via ambulance) with left shoulder pain and swelling after being thrown from a bicycle. He was triaged as a level 2. At 11:11 am, the on-call surgeon (Staff B) was called, and a message was left. At 11:35 am, and 11:58 am, additional messages were left for Staff B. At 12:01 pm, Staff I (ED Physician) consulted with Staff J (Cardiothoracic Surgeon) who provided treatment orders. At 12:08 pm, a trauma surgeon from another hospital (Staff K) was contacted and he/she accepted the patient for transfer. The MR lacks documentation of any return call from Staff B, the on-call surgeon.

-- During interview of Staff L (Director of Quality Management) on 7/31/17 at 2:00 pm, he/she acknowledged the above findings.

Findings regarding (3) above include:

--  Review of the facility's surgery on-call list for June and July of 2017, identified the following: on June 1, 5 (date of the index case), 9, 17, 21, 25, 29, 2017 and July 3, 7, 19, 27, 31, 2017, Staff B is listed as the on-call surgeon. However, per interview of Staff M (ED Medical Director) on 7/28/17 at 10:40 am, he/she confirmed that Staff B's name indicated his/her surgical group is on call. It may be one of the three surgeons in the group, not specifically Staff B.

-- Per interview of Staff N (Chief Medical Officer) on 7/28/17 at 11:00 am, he/she stated there is no formal communication with this surgical group to indicate which specific physician is on call.
 
-- Per interview of Staff L on 7/28/17 at 12:50 pm, he/she stated the head of the surgical group is listed on the on-call list and the group decides who is on call. He/she was not sure who exactly was on call on 6/5/17.

Findings regarding (4) above include:

-- Per review of the hospital's P&P titled ""EMTALA: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act- Screening, Stabilization, Management of Transfers and Recordkeeping; Reporting Suspected EMTALA Violations,"" dated 3/2017, and the hospital's ""Medical Staff Rules and Regulations,"" last revised 6/2017, these documents did not address simultaneous call or contain a back up procedure when the on-call physician is not available to respond.

-- During interview of Staff N (Chief Medical Officer) on 7/28/17 at 11:15 am, he/she acknowledged the above findings.

Based on review of the Emergency Department (ED) log on 10/12/11, the facility failed to maintain a central log that includes all patients who presented to Triage in the ED.

Findings:

Review of the electronic central ED log on 10/12/11 for the months of June 2011 to October 2011 revealed the central log was incomplete and did not include patients that were seen by the Triage nurse in the ED and sent to Labor and Delivery (L&D).  The L&D department log for the same period (MDS) dated [DATE] did not specify which patients came from the ED.

Review of medical records for Patients #22 and #24 indicated these patients (MDS) dated [DATE], but the ED log did not document that these patients were seen by the Triage nurse. 

The Outpatient/Observation record for Patient #22 documented she had (MDS) dated [DATE] and was transported from the ED via a wheelchair to L&D at 1320.  The ED log does not mention this patient. 

Review of the Outpatient/Observation record for Patient #24 indicated this pregnant woman (MDS) dated [DATE] and was taken in a wheelchair to L&D.  The ED log does not mention this patient. 
 
On 10/12/11 at 1030 during an onsite inspection of the ED the Registrars on duty stated ""when a patient presents to the ED for treatment we send them over to the Triage nurse.""

The facility's policy entitled ""Function of the Triage Nurse"" dated 01/2011 states: ""The Triage RN is the first professional contact with the patient and family at which time she/he makes initial assessment of the patient's condition.""

The facility's policy entitled ""Triage and Chart Flow System"" dated 01/2011 states: ""The triage RN is the first person to assess all the ambulatory patients who arrive to the Emergency Department.  The nurse determines urgency and priority of all patients and determines the resources required (e.g., L&D, Trauma Room, etc.).""  This assessment was not evident in the medical records for Patient  #22 and #24 and was not evident in the ED log.  

These findings were confirmed by Hospital Administration.

Based upon interview and document review the recipient hospital refused to accept Patient #1 in transfer despite the availability of the specialized services and the capacity to treat the patient. 

Findings include:

Review of the transferring hospital's medical record for Patient #1 revealed the patient (MDS) dated [DATE] with complaints of abdominal pain. The patient was found to be in labor with no previous prenatal care. Due to the lack of obstetrical services at the transferring hospital, the plan was to transfer the patient to a hospital with obstetrical services. 

Review of the transferring hospital's Emergency Department (ED) Physician Record dated 4/24/12 revealed that following a discussion of the case with the receiving facility perinatologist, it was decided that the patient was not a high risk patient and as such should be admitted     directly to the OB service and that the OB service on-call physician would be contacted. At 10:55pm the transferring hospital received a follow-up call from the intended recipient hospital indicating the transfer would not be accepted and that another hospital should be contacted for transfer. 

Interview with Staff #6 on 6/5/12 revealed a call was received from the transferring hospital ED physician requesting transfer of the patient. Gestational age was estimated to be 35-36 weeks based on measurements taken by the transferring hospital ED physician. Staff #6 informed the ED physician that based on the available information, the patient was not a high risk patient and as such could be admitted     directly to the OB service. Staff #6 informed Staff #5, the on-call OB service physician, who disagreed regarding the patient's risk status due to the lack of ultrasound dating and prenatal care. Staff #6 contacted the transferring hospital and suggested they contact another hospital for transfer. 

Interview with Staff #5 on 6/4/12 revealed he believed the perinatology service should have accepted the patient due to the patient's lack of prenatal care and questionable dating. 

Review of the Labor and Delivery Suite Patient Classification and Report Sheet dated 4/24/12 revealed when the initial request for transfer was recieved, patient census was 4. 

Interview with Staff # 3 on 6/5/12 revealed a capacity of 8 beds in the labor and delivery suite and 20 beds on the postpartum unit. The postpartum patient census on 4/24/12 was 18. 

Despite having the specialized services required and the capacity to treat the patient, transfer was refused due to a difference in opinion as to which OB service the patient should be admitted     to.

Based on medical record review, policy review, document review and interview, the hospital does not ensure that the risks of transfer specific to the patient's medical condition are documented, as evidenced for 9 of 20 emergency department (ED) patients who were transferred to another acute facility.  (Patients #2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 22 and 24)

Findings include: 

Medical record review on 9/30/13 revealed no evidence that the risks of transfer specific to the patient condition was listed and/or discussed with the patient for the following patients:
 - On 9/25/13, Patient #2 was being transferred due to hypotension and general weakness.
 - On 9/22/13, Patient #4 was being transferred due to acute appendicitis.
 - On 9/13/13, Patient #8 was being transferred due to an acute abdomen.

 - On 8/7/13, Patient #22 was being transferred due to STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction).
 - On 6/5/13, Patient #24 was being transferred due to active labor. 

Review on 10/1/13 of policy ""EMTALA: Screening, Stabilization and Transfers"" (dated 12/18/12) revealed a physician must certify the medical benefits from transfer outweigh the risks and describe the reasons for and the potential risks and benefits by completing the applicable areas on the Patient Transfer Physician Certification form. 

Review on 10/1/13 of the Physician Certification of Transfer and Informed Consent to Transfer form revealed the following: 
 - Section IV - Risks vs. Benefits section includes an area for the physician to write at least one risk of transfer specific to the patient's current condition. 
 - Section VIII - Patient Consent to Transfer section has two options/check-off boxes for the patient to select: 
 1. to indicate whether they consent to transfer, have been informed of the risks of transfer versus the benefits, understand risks and consent to transfer. 
 2. patient refusal to transfer. 
There is another area (box) in this section for the patient/representative to sign.

Based on policy review, medical record review and interview, there is lack of physician documentation related to ongoing medical examinations provided to Patient #24 in order to stabilize her emergency medical condition. 

Findings include: 

Review on 10/1/13 of policy ""EMTALA: Screening, Stabilization and Transfers"" (dated 12/18/12) revealed any woman in active labor is considered unstable for the purposes of EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act). The physician must ensure that the evaluations/assessments included in the MSE (medical screening examination) are documented in the patient's medical record. In addition, the physician must determine and clearly document whether the patient has an EMC (emergency medical condition) in the patient's medical record. 

Review on 10/1/13 of the emergency department (ED) medical record dated 6/5/13 for Patient #24 revealed the following: 
 - ED Physician record indicates Patient #24 was seen on arrival at 4:30 AM by ED Physician Staff #8 for labor pains. She was full term and scheduled for a C-Section on 6/20/13. She had a history of seizure and was on Lamictal. Blood pressure was 130/92, pulse 88, temperature 98 and pulse oximetry 99%. FHS (fetal heart sounds) were 140. A pelvic exam showed water discharge, dilation and at full term. At 4:30 AM, Patient #24's OB (obstetric) physician was contacted, who gave instructions to send Patient #24 to another specified hospital with obstetrics service. At 4:45 AM, the OB physician at the other facility was contacted, but he could not come. Facility Medical Director Staff #16 was called and is on his way. 
 - The Physician Certification of Transfer and Informed Consent to Transfer form documented that an MSE was performed, the EMC was stabilized and a higher level of care was required for active labor, but it did not indicate risks specific to Patient #24's medical condition. Patient #1 was transfered by ambulance at 6:35 AM. See Tag #A-2409.
 - No further documentation of ongoing medical examinations and/or treatment by either Staff #8 or 16 was found in the medical record. 

During telephone interview on 10/3/13 at 10:45 AM, Staff #16 indicated he should have done a medical record entry on Patient #24 and there could have been more documentation by Staff #8.

Based on document review, video review, interview and in one (1) of four (4) Medical Records reviewed, the facility failed to provide an appropriate Medical Screening Examination (MSE) to determine if an Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) existed.

This lack of an MSE may have placed patients at an increased safety risk.

Findings include:

The facility's security video of the emergency room    (ER), dated 09/06/18, from 6:40PM to 7:25PM identified the following:

*6:40:35PM - Patient #1 entered the Registration Room from the Waiting Room, passed two (2) Security Guards, and bypassed the Triage Room.

*6:41:13PM - Patient #1 exited the Registration Room, entered the ER, and walked towards the Staff Lounge. Patient remained in the Staff Lounge for approximately forty (40) minutes.

*7:20:05PM - Patient #1 then exited the Staff Lounge with Staff H (Access Service Representative {ASR}) and walked to the Nurses' Station.

*7:21:24PM - Staff K (ASR) was observed with Patient #1. Staff K walked to the printer, retrieved labels, then returned to the desk and placed an identification (ID) band on Patient #1. At this time, Staff H walked through the Triage Room to the Security Desk, picked up a pad, brought it into the Triage Room and handed it to Staff G (Registered Nurse {RN}), and was observed talking to Staff G and Staff J (RN).

*7:22:00PM to 7:22:39PM - Staff H was observed talking to Staff F (Physician).

*7:22:41PM - Patient #1 and Staff K joined Staff Members H and F at the Nurses' Station and appeared to have a conversation.

*7:22:48PM - Staff I (RN) is observed standing behind the Doctor.

*7:23:54PM - Patient #1 is observed making a phone call on her cell phone.

*7:24:02PM - Staff F picked up the phone and Staff I walked away.

*7:24:25PM - Patient #1 walked out of the Emergency Department (ED).
As per video review, the patient presented to the ED, was registered, spoke with a Physician and staff, then exited the ED approximately three (3) minutes later.

Review of Patient #1's Medical Record identified that on 09/06/18 at 7:31PM, a [AGE]-year-old female presented to the emergency room   , was registered, then left prior to triage at 7:33PM. The Triage Note stated, ""The patient no longer wanted to be seen in this hospital"". Total visit time was two (2) minutes. No documentation indicating the patient was offered an MSE or refused care/treatment was found.

Per interview of Staff F on 09/25/18 at approximately 11:30AM, Staff F stated that on 09/06/18, she was at the end of her shift, sitting at the Nursing Station, completing work. Staff F was approached by a Registrar/Secretary and asked if she would perform an ultrasound on a patient. Staff F stated she knew Patient #1, since Patient #1 is an employee. She asked Patient #1 what was wrong. Patient #1 complained she was having belly pain and asked if Staff F would perform an ultrasound ""off the record"". Staff F stated she encouraged Patient #1 to ""get registered"" and to be evaluated by a Doctor. Staff F then answered a phone call and did not realize Patient #1 had left. When asked why she didn't document this conversation in the Medical Record, Staff F stated, ""she wasn't my patient, so there's no reason why I would have documented on her"".

Per interview of Staff G (Triage RN) on 09/25/18 at 1:15PM, Staff G confirmed she was working in Triage on 09/06/18, when she was approached by the patient's co-worker, Staff H.

Staff H informed Staff G that the patient ""needs to be seen"". Staff G stated to Staff H that ""We don't have labor and delivery here, ... there was no reason the patient couldn't be seen ... but I just wanted her to know that this is not a labor and delivery hospital"". Staff G suggested the patient speak to the Doctor to determine what would be the best route for the patient.

Staff G stated, ""I know [Patient #1] is pregnant, but I never spoke to the patient. I didn't get any paperwork on the patient ... the patient went directly to the Secretary, and never came to Triage ... They [patient and co-worker] spoke to the Doctor and she [Patient #1] left."" When asked why she didn't engage the patient, Staff G replied, ""The patient was already talking to the Doctor"".

Per interview of Staff I (RN) on 09/25/18 between 2:00PM and 3:00PM, Staff I stated that on 09/06/18, ""When I walked over to the Nursing Station to tell [Staff F] something, I overheard the conversation and Staff F encouraged the patient to stay and be seen ... the Secretaries were trying to talk her out of driving herself to LIJ (Long Island Jewish). I asked her why doesn't she stay? The patient refused and stated that she wanted to go to LIJ or Manhasset.""

Per interview of Staff H (Access Service Representative) on 09/26/18 at 1:40PM, Staff H stated that on 09/06/18, ""I mentioned to Staff G (Triage RN) that Patient #1 wasn't feeling good, that she's having stomach pains and is really upset. Staff G stated, ""I don't know what we will be able to do for her here. Maybe you should speak to one of the Doctors."" Then I went to speak to Staff F. I explained the situation to Staff F and she then called the patient over to speak to her. I left her (Patient #1) at the Nursing Station while I was having the conversation with the Triage Nurse. I didn't hear the conversation between the patient and the Doctor. She (Patient #1) was crying. I was trying to stop her and tell her it was not good for her to drive in that condition.""

The facility could not provide documented evidence that Patient #1 had received a Medical Screening Examination or refused a Medical Screening Examination when offered.

STAFF F WAS APPROACHED BY A REGISTRAR/SECRETARY AND ASKED IF SHE WOULD PERFORM AN ULTRASOUND ON A PATIENT. STAFF F STATED SHE KNEW PATIENT #1, SINCE PATIENT #1 IS AN EMPLOYEE. SHE ASKED PATIENT #1 WHAT WAS WRONG. PATIENT #1 COMPLAINED SHE WAS HAVING BELLY PAIN AND ASKED IF STAFF F WOULD PERFORM AN ULTRASOUND ""OFF THE RECORD"". STAFF F STATED SHE ENCOURAGED PATIENT #1 TO ""GET REGISTERED"" AND TO BE EVALUATED BY A DOCTOR. STAFF F THEN ANSWERED A PHONE CALL AND DID NOT REALIZE PATIENT #1 HAD LEFT. WHEN ASKED WHY SHE DIDN'T DOCUMENT THIS CONVERSATION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD, STAFF F STATED, ""SHE WASN'T MY PATIENT, SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY I WOULD HAVE DOCUMENTED ON HER"".

PER INTERVIEW OF STAFF G (TRIAGE RN) ON 09/25/18 AT 1:15PM, STAFF G CONFIRMED SHE WAS WORKING IN TRIAGE ON 09/06/18, WHEN SHE WAS APPROACHED BY THE PATIENT'S CO-WORKER, STAFF H.

STAFF H INFORMED STAFF G THAT THE PATIENT ""NEEDS TO BE SEEN"". STAFF G STATED TO STAFF H THAT ""WE DON'T HAVE LABOR AND DELIVERY HERE, ... THERE WAS NO REASON THE PATIENT COULDN'T BE SEEN ... BUT I JUST WANTED HER TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A LABOR AND DELIVERY HOSPITAL"". STAFF G SUGGESTED THE PATIENT SPEAK TO THE DOCTOR TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST ROUTE FOR THE PATIENT.

STAFF G STATED, ""I KNOW [PATIENT #1] IS PREGNANT, BUT I NEVER SPOKE TO THE PATIENT. I DIDN'T GET ANY PAPERWORK ON THE PATIENT ... THE PATIENT WENT DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY, AND NEVER CAME TO TRIAGE ... THEY [PATIENT AND CO-WORKER] SPOKE TO THE DOCTOR AND SHE [PATIENT #1] LEFT."" WHEN ASKED WHY SHE DIDN'T ENGAGE THE PATIENT, STAFF G REPLIED, ""THE PATIENT WAS ALREADY TALKING TO THE DOCTOR"".

PER INTERVIEW OF STAFF I (RN) ON 09/25/18 BETWEEN 2:00PM AND 3:00PM, STAFF I STATED THAT ON 09/06/18, ""WHEN I WALKED OVER TO THE NURSING STATION TO TELL [STAFF F] SOMETHING, I OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION AND STAFF F ENCOURAGED THE PATIENT TO STAY AND BE SEEN ...

Based on document review and interview, the hospital did not provide a medical screening exam (MSE) for 1 of 22 patients who presented to the hospital for emergency care (Patient #1).  A lack of a medical screening exam could result in an emergency medical condition not being identified and treated.

Findings include:

Review of the facility's Lockout Team Debrief dated 11/7/17 revealed the hospital was placed on lock-down from 11/2/17 at 10:35pm to 11/3/17 at 3:35am following a security alert.

Complainant Subject (Patient #3):

Closed medical record review conducted on 10/13/2020 revealed Patient #3 was a [AGE]-year-old female who presented to Hospital A on 06/07/2020 at 1416 by private vehicle complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting. Patient #3 was triaged as a Level 3 (Levels are assigned when the patients present to the DED, with Level 1 being the most emergent and Level 5 being the least emergent); and her vital signs at 1521 were: blood pressure (BP) 133/88, pulse (P) 97, respirations (R) 17, pulse oximetry (SPO2) 99 % on room air, and temperature (T) 98.7 F, taken orally. At 1602 Patient #3 reported pain rated at 4 of 10. An MSE was initiated by Nurse Practitioner (NP) #1 at 1524. Review of a Provider Note written by NP #1 on 06/08/2020 at 0054 revealed, ""...[AGE]-year-old female patient presenting to the emergency department 3 days of nausea and vomiting. Patient denies any diarrhea, fever, or chills. She does report generalized abdominal pain with increased pain to the epigastric area. She states that she threw up bright red blood just prior to arrival. She states it was about one half of a cup. She denies ever having vomited blood in the past. She has had extensive abdominal surgeries to include a (sic) exploratory abdominal surgery after a gunshot wound in 1999 which resulted in a bowel resection.

The CAT scan of your abdomen and pelvis did not show any life-threatening causes of your abdominal pain or your vomiting. As discussed it is the best idea to follow-up with a gastroenterologist for possible endoscopy due to the episode of vomiting that you had with blood in it. While waiting to see gastroenterology if your symptoms become worse or you start persistently vomiting blood or you vomit a large amount of blood please return to the emergency department and we will reevaluate you at that time. Take the pain and nausea medicine as prescribed. Follow-up with your primary care provider in the next 3 to 5 days. Call tomorrow to schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist.

Patient #3 was discharged    from the DED on 06/07/2020 at 2137. Review revealed a co-signature on Patient #3's chart by MD (Medical Doctor) #1 on 06/09/2020 at 0324, which read, ""I was personally available for consultation in the Emergency Department and serving as supervising physician for the MLP (Mid-Level Provider)."" The facility failed to ensure that their own Policy and Procedure was followed as evidenced by failing to provide further medical examination  and treatment prior to discharge for patient #3 on  6/7/2020, who had abnormal labs, Metabolic Acidosis, and an elevated anion gap. As  the patient required admission for treatment for abnormal labs, and was not stable for discharge.

Patient #3 presented to Hospital B's DED on 06/10/2020 and was subsequently admitted     to Hospital B for DKA. Patient #3 was discharged    from Hospital B on 06/12/2020 after stabilizing treatment was rendered.

No nausea or vomiting. She is tolerating a diet...""

Telephone interview was conducted with NP #1 on 10/13/2020 at 1340. Interview revealed NP #1 recalled Patient #3 as her Medical Director brought Patient #3 to NP #1's attention approximately 2 weeks after care was provided. Interview revealed NP #1 did not see Patient #3's laboratory studies prior to discharge. NP #1 recalled having 3 female patients with abdominal pain at the same time, in rooms next to each other. Interview revealed Patient #3 was in room 34, and a nurse reported that ""34 felt better and wanted to go home."" NP #1 advised she said, ""OK I'll write her up for discharge."" Interview revealed, ""I must have looked at one of the other patient's labs. That was a mistake on my part."" Interview revealed upon review of Patient #3's laboratory values she ""absolutely had new onset diabetes and was in DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis - when the blood sugar is too high, and the blood begins to become acidic). She (Patient #3) should have been admitted     to the hospital."" Interview revealed NP #1's medical director recommended always re-checking laboratory and any imaging orders prior to any patient's discharge to avoid future confusion. 

Telephone interview was conducted on 10/13/2020 at 1517 with the Dedicated Emergency Department Medical Director (DED MD). Interview revealed he was aware of Patient #3's case. Interview revealed it appeared NP #1 was confused on the patient's lab values. Interview revealed midlevel practitioners were not expected to consult with their oversight physicians on every patient they see, for example the level 4 and 5 patients. Some Level 3 patients may require oversight physician consult, depending upon the comfort level of the midlevel practitioner when providing care. Any care provided by a midlevel practitioner to a Level 1 or 2 patient would require oversight provider consult. Interview revealed if NP #1 had looked at Patient #3's lab values correctly she would have been expected to communicate with her oversight provider. 

Telephone interview was conducted on 10/14/2020 at 1000 with MD #1. Interview revealed MD #1 did not recall Patient #3. MD #1 had reviewed Patient #3's case with the DED MD. Interview revealed if Mid-Level Providers had concerns with any patients it was customary for them to bring those concerns to the oversight physician, but that did not occur in this case. Interview revealed MD #1 felt confident that if NP #1 had reviewed Patient #3's labs correctly, ""she would have brought them to my attention.""

Based on review of medical records and hospital documents and interviews with hospital staff, the hospital failed to provide a medical screening examination sufficient to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition existed.  This occurred in one of twenty-five medical records reviewed.

Findings:

Patient #1 - On 11/19/2012 at 2247, the patient presented as a transfer from another acute care hospital with lower abdominal pain and a diagnosis of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].  The ER  physician evaluated the patient and consulted with the on-call obstetric/gynecology (OB/Gyn) specialist concerning the management of the patient.  The results of the tests were discussed with the specialist.  The OB/Gyn did not come to the ER  and examine the patient to perform further clinical examination.  It was known, due to the ultrasound results that an [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] could not be excluded as there was a complex mass in the left adnexa adjacent to the fundus of the uterus; as well as free fluid present within the right adnexa adjacent to the uterus.  

1.  The ER  physician did not perform a pelvic examination.

2.  The ER  physician did not order a repeat complete blood count to ensure that the hemoglobin was not decreasing which could be a clinical indicator of internal hemorrhage of a ruptured fallopian tube.

3. No further examination was done to rule out [DIAGNOSES REDACTED].

4.  During the interview with the ER  physician on the morning of 12/05/2012, she confirmed the above findings with the surveyor and that she relayed the findings first to the on-call OB/Gyn and then relayed what the OB/Gyn gave as options.

Based on interview, review of documentation in 4 of 21 medical records of patients who presented to the hospital for emergency services (Patients 1, 15, 20 and 22), and review of policies and procedures and other documents it was determined that the hospital failed to fully develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that all patients were provided a complete and appropriate MSE.  

1. a. The policy and procedure ""EMTALA (ARRMC)"" dated as last revised 05/27/2016 included the following requirements: 
* ""In order to be compliant with the Federal Law -Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act (EMTALA): The hospital will provide an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) within the capability of the Hospital's dedicated emergency department (ED) or obstetrical department (OB), including ancillary services routinely available to the dedicated ED/OB, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists. The examination will be conducted by an individual(s) determined qualified by Hospital Bylaws or Rules and Regulations; and The Hospital will provide all patients that present to the dedicated emergency department and/or OB with an EMC, a MSE and the treatment which is required to stabilize the EMC, within the capability of the Hospital, or will arrange for transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with the procedures set forth below...Once the MSE has been performed, including performing necessary tests/exams and it has been determined that an EMC does not exist, the patient may be discharged    from the ED."" 
* ""A physician or a QMP...shall perform the MSE. The physician or QMP shall determine within reasonable clinical confidence whether the individual has an EMC, utilizing the services within the capability of the ED/OB, and using ancillary services and resources routinely available in the ED/OB for individuals with similar symptoms. The MSE may be an ongoing process and the medical record must reflect this assessment of the patient's condition. Monitoring must continue until it is deemed the individual is stable, and it is deemed they have no emergent medical condition...""

b. The ""[ARRMC] Medical Staff Rules and Regulations"" dated at last approved by the ARRMC Board on 08/06/2018 included the following articles:
* ""Article IV Content and Timeliness of Medical Record Documentation"" included a section ""Emergency Care"" that stipulated ""Medical records of patients who have received emergency care will contain the information outlined in this section...This documentation will be the joint responsibility of the responsible practitioners and the Hospital: ...Record of care prior to arrival; Known long-term medications, including current medication, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations; Pertinent history of the injury or illness, including details relative to first aid or emergency care given to the patient prior to his or her arrival at the Emergency Department; Results of the medical screening examination, including significant clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings; Treatment given, if any; Conclusions at termination of treatment, including final disposition, condition, and instructions for follow-up care...""

* Article VII included a section ""Post-Procedural Procedures"" that stipulated ""An operative procedure report must be dictated immediately after an operative procedure and entered into the record. The operative procedure report shall include...the type of anesthesia/sedation used and name of the practitioner providing anesthesia...""

2. a. Although the ED central log for 10/27/2018 did not include an entry that reflected Patient 22 presented to the hospital for emergency services, the EPIC EHR system did contain documentation that reflected Patient 22 was brought to the hospital from PMMC, a nearby hospital, by EMS ambulance on 10/27/2018 at 2206. The record reflected the patient's course through the ED was as follows:
* At 2206 an ED RN entry reflected ""Triage Started.""
* At 2208 an ED RN recorded ""Brought in by EMS from Providence ER  to have a bolt placed in [his/her] skull for ICP. Patient is [on a ventilator] and to go to Portland after."" 
* At 2208 an ED RN recorded ""Suicide Risk Assessment...Unable to Assess...On a vent."" 
* At 2209 an ED RN recorded ""Have you had a fever in the last few days? No;"" and ""Was the patient educated that weapons are not allowed per policy? Yes."" However, one minute prior the RN had recorded inability to assess because the patient was ""on a vent.""
* At 2210 an ED RN entry reflected ""Triage Completed"" however there was no documentation of assessment of the patient's physical presentation and condition nor that a triage acuity had been assigned.  
* At 2210 an ED RN recorded that cefazolin (Ancef) 2g in D5W IVPB was administered in accordance with a physician's order that was written at 2157, prior to the time of Patient 22's arrival to the ED. 
* At 2212 an ED RN recorded only ""MD at bedside.""
* At 2215 an ED RN recorded only ""[Neurosurgeon Physician M] at bedside for procedure. Patient head shaved. Site marked by provider.""
* At 2225 an ED RN recorded only ""ICP drain placed clear fluid in drain coming out of drain.""
* At 2236 an ED RN entry reflected that the RN initiated a ""New Bag"" of nicardipine (Cardene) in accordance with a physician's order written at 2236, and in another entry at that same time the RN recorded that the nicardipine was infusing ""per continuous drip while in procedure."" 
* At 2239 an ED RN recorded only ""Patient has Cardene, Versed and Fentanyl infusing with transfer from Providence. Patient hooked up to ICP monitor, ICP of 8."" However, there was no MAR nor readings from the ICP monitor.
* At 2241 an ED RN recorded only ""Patient to leave ER  to fly to Portland with flight crew.""
* At 2250 an ED RN recorded only ""Patient discharged    with Mercy Flights to transport to [PSVMC in Portland].""
* At 2347 an ED MD recorded only ""I was not involved with care of this patient. Patient was transferred from [PMMC] for the neurosurgical service."" However, there was no transfer form or other transfer documentation.
* There was no other documentation by an ED MD to reflect that the patient received a MSE.
* The only other physician documentation in the record was an ""Operative Note"" dictated on 10/27/2018 at 2300 and electronically signed by Physician M four days later on 10/31/2018 at 1758. 
* The ""Operative Note"" included the following:
- ""Preoperative Diagnosis: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and Glasgow coma score 3T.""
- ""Postoperative Diagnosis: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and [DIAGNOSES REDACTED] and Glasgow coma score 3T.""
- ""Procedure: Right frontal twist drill bur hole for placement of right frontal external ventricular drain with antibiotic impregnated catheter."" 
- ""Description of Procedure: The patient was maintained on the [EMS ambulance transport stretcher] with [his/her] head of the bed elevated...midline/sagittal suture was then palpated and marked...an incision line marked...prepped x2 with ChloraPrep...sterilely draped...skin was incised with a 15 blade and a self-retaining retractor was placed. A twist drill bur hole was then fashioned...dura was then penetrated with a spinal needle and then by a Cushing needle. The ventricular drain was then passed...crystal clear CSF on the first pass. Estimated ICP was less than 10...incision was then closed...sterilely connected to the drainage bag and confirmed to be draining..."" The last statement recorded under the ""Description of Procedure"" was ""[Waveform brain activity] was difficult to assess on the [EMS ambulance transport monitor]."" 
- ""Complications: None.""
* There was no other documentation in the record of Patient 22 by Physician M or by an ED Physician.

The record of Patient 22 was incomplete and did not conform with ARRMC policies and procedures, including those that required a MSE:
* There was a lack of documentation to reflect that triage and nursing assessment had been completed, including related to the patient's physical condition, to tubes and lines present, and LOC.
* There was no documentation that an MSE had been conducted that included a physical exam and labwork, imaging or other diagnostic testing as appropriate.  
* There was no documentation to reflect that the Neurosurgeon Physician M had conducted or consulted on a MSE for Patient 22, or that a H&P had been conducted prior to the operative procedure.
* There were no physician orders or incomplete physician orders for care and services provided including for the ventilator and the ""Cardene, Versed and Fentanyl infusing."" 
* There was no documentation of ventilator care, and management/monitoring of the Cardene, Versed and Fentanyl IV medications infusing during the ED encounter. 
* There was no ARRMC consent for care and services, or informed consent for the invasive operative procedure performed.
* There was no documentation of anesthesia or sedation administered to Patient 22 during the operative procedure.
* Further, the documentation in Physician M's Operative Note revealed that the patient was not moved off of the EMS ambulance gurney during the ED encounter; and that care and services were rendered using equipment that did not belong to ARRMC and that had not been subject to ARRMC preventive maintenance to ensure equipment functionality, accuracy and integrity. In fact, Physician M's last notation was that Patient 22's brain activity was difficult to assess on the ambulance monitor. There was no follow-up or verification of Patient 22's brain activity on ARRMC equipment to provide a clear and accurate assessment prior to the patient's discharge from the ED. 

b. A written statement in memo/letter form Physician M was dated 11/02/2018. The document contained the following information from Physician M about the care and services rendered to Patient 22 from the time he/she presented to the ARRMC ED:
* ""Patient arrival in ED - [Patient 22] arrived approximately 1-1/2 hours after transfer arrangements were initiated. [He/she] was not removed from the transport stretcher and Mercy flights monitors remained in place throughout [his/her] care. Mercy Flight managed [his/her] medications, ventilator, etc. except for antibiotics that were necessary for the procedure. Mercy Flights confirmed no allergies. A right frontal ventriculostomy was placed after the administration of prophylactic antibiotics with a very low intracranial pressure identified upon placement and confirmed with a measurement of 8 after connecting to the transducer. [He/she] was then prepared to return on [his/her] course to Portland and I specifically asked both the Mercy Flights crew and the emergency department personnel if any further paperwork, phone calls were necessary and all stated 'no.' I did contact the [PSVMC] intensivist and informed [him/her] that the ventriculostomy went well with a low ICP and [Patient 22] was on route....I was then contacted by [PMMC ED physician]...Apparently, there was difficulty with the patient flying from Medford to Portland and [he/she] wished my certification the patient could go by ground transport. This would be at the discretion of the receiving facility. It had been my understanding we would not be assuming any direct patient care. I did not admit to the (sic) patient to our hospital and [Patient 22] remained under the care of the transport team throughout [his/her] visit to the emergency department. [PMMC ED physician] asked if I had filled out EMTALA paperwork for the patient transfer to [PSVMC]. Given I had not assumed care...this was not performed. Further paperwork was not requested by the transferring team/Mercy flights.""

c. During interview with the VPMA and the ARRMC JD on 1/03/2018 at 1228 they stated that there were no hospital policies and procedures for holding EMS vehicles, equipment and personnel, and none for the provision of hospital care and services on EMS transport gurney/stretchers and monitors, nor for the provision of hospital care and services by EMS personnel.

3. The ED record for Patient 1 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1953 with a chief complaint of ""Suicidal."" The record reflected the patient's course through the ED included the following:
* At 1956 the ED TN recorded ""PT states [he/she] feels suicidal. Has a plan to take all [his/her] pills. States [he/she] called psych this afternoon and instructed to come in.""
* At 1958 the ED TN recorded ""Patient Acuity: 2""  
* Between 2026 and 2032 urine and blood were collected for multiple lab orders.
* At 2034 the ED physician placed an order for a ""Psychiatric Nurse Consult.""
* At 2142 an ED RN recorded ""Patient threatens to leave, 'If I don't get my [expletive] anxiety meds!' Pt encouraged to stay, be patient w/ assessment. Reports, 'I believe I'll be safe w/ my fiance. [He/she'll] keep me safe, [he/she's] part of my safety plans. I'm just here to get my prescriptions filled' Patient provided w/belongings, provider notified."" 
* At 2150 an ED RN recorded ""Patient discharged   .""
* At 2150 the ED physician recorded ""ED Disposition set to AMA.""
* At 2314 the ED physician's note was electronically signed and included the following:  
- ""Assessment and Plan: Chief Complaint: Suicidal. Differential Diagnosis includes: Diagnostic Plan: PCU evaluation and then confer with me, laboratory work""
- ""ER Course:"" was blank.
- ""Medical Decision Making: [Patient 1]...presents to the emergency department for evaluation of suicidal ideations. TC nurse did not talk with me in (sic) the patient left. Apparently [first name], psychiatric nurse did an evaluation, felt the patient was safe to leave. I was notified via Dr. halo the patient was leaving and immediately asked [first name] PCU nurse not to let [Patient 1] go but they stated they are to let [Patient 1] leave. Apparently [first name] with PCU states patient contracted for safety with them. They left."" 
- ""Consultations. PCU nurse evaluation.""
- ""Final MDM Summary. Left against medical device (sic).""
- ""Clinical Impression. Left against medical advice.""
- ""Disposition: Ama.""

There was no documentation in the record of a ""Psychiatric Nurse Evaluation"" ordered by the ED physician nor was there any documentation by the ""PCU nurse"" referred to in the ED physician's 2314 note. 

There was no documentation in the record that the risks of leaving the hospital prior to the completion of the MSE had been reviewed with and understood by the patient on an AMA form or in any other narrative or format.  

The ED record of Patient 1 reflected he/she presented to the ED because he/she was ""Suicidal,"" did not receive a complete MSE to determine if a psychiatric EMC existed and had not been informed of the risks of leaving the hospital without one.  

4. The ED record of Patient 15 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 0949 with chief complaint of ""...blood in urine x 3 days. Frequency with voiding, back pain."" The record reflected the patient's course through the ED included the following:
* At 0956 the ED TN recorded patent had a ""history of [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]."" 
* Between 1059 and 1250 urine and blood were collected for multiple lab orders and imaging testing was conducted.
* At 1215 the ED NP's note was electronically signed and reflected ""Chief complaint: 1 week of intermittent hematuria, R flank pain and dysuria. Clots and lots of bleeding today. Pertinent findings: PMH bladder Ca 5 years ago. Has appt Tuesday with Kaiser MD in Ca with CT ordered (visiting here). Plan: rainbow draw, cbc, cmp, CT renal.""
* The next entry by an RN was recorded at 1315 and was ""No change in patient condition.""
* At 1354 the ED NP's note was electronically signed and reflected ""Patient was unavailable when called twice. Patient presented back to the window and I reviewed all the results with [him/her]. [He/she] does have an appointment on Tuesday in California with [his/her] doctor and will follow-up then. [He/she'll] return to the emergency room    if [he/she] has any further concerns.""  
* At 1355 the ED NP recorded ""Patient dismissed...Patient departed from ED.""
* At 1534 the ED NP recorded ""ED Disposition set to LWBS after Triage.""

There was no documentation in the record that the risks of leaving the hospital prior to the completion of the MSE had been reviewed with and understood by the patient on an AMA form or in any other narrative or format.  

The ED record of Patient 15 reflected he/she did not receive a complete MSE to determine if an EMC existed and had not been informed of the risks of leaving the hospital without one.  

5. The ED record of Patient 20 reflected that he/she presented to the ED by ""Other"" means of arrival on 10/17/2018 at 0058 with a chief complaint of  ""poison oak."" The record reflected that the patient's course through the ED was: 
* At 0102 the ED TN recorded ""Triage Started.""
* At 0105 the ED TN recorded ""Patient dismissed.""
* At 1509 the ED NP recorded ""Patient left without being sen (sic) after triage. No studies were ordered"" and ""ED Disposition set to LWBS after Triage.""
* The only other documentation in the EHR was an unsigned note that reflected ""Patient's [spouse] is in L and D having a baby and patient doesn't want to wait to be seen.""

The documentation by the ED TN and the ED NP inaccurately reflected that the patient left the ED ""after"" triage as there was no documentation that any aspect of triage had occurred. For example, there was no documentation of vital signs, no documentation of observation and assessment of the affected area on the patient's body, and no documentation of the triage priority assigned after triage has been completed. 

There was no documentation in the record that the risks of leaving the hospital prior to an MSE had been reviewed with and understood by the patient on an AMA form or in any other narrative or format.  

The ED record of Patient 20 reflected he/she did not receive an MSE to determine if an EMC existed and had not been informed of the risks of leaving the hospital without one.

2. A. ALTHOUGH THE ED CENTRAL LOG FOR 10/27/2018 DID NOT INCLUDE AN ENTRY THAT REFLECTED PATIENT 22 PRESENTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES, THE EPIC EHR SYSTEM DID CONTAIN DOCUMENTATION THAT REFLECTED PATIENT 22 WAS BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL FROM PMMC, A NEARBY HOSPITAL, BY EMS AMBULANCE ON 10/27/2018 AT 2206.

IN FACT, PHYSICIAN M'S LAST NOTATION WAS THAT PATIENT 22'S BRAIN ACTIVITY WAS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS ON THE AMBULANCE MONITOR. THERE WAS NO FOLLOW-UP OR VERIFICATION OF PATIENT 22'S BRAIN ACTIVITY ON ARRMC EQUIPMENT TO PROVIDE A CLEAR AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO THE PATIENT'S DISCHARGE FROM THE ED. 

B. A WRITTEN STATEMENT IN MEMO/LETTER FORM PHYSICIAN M WAS DATED 11/02/2018. THE DOCUMENT CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM PHYSICIAN M ABOUT THE CARE AND SERVICES RENDERED TO PATIENT 22 FROM THE TIME HE/SHE PRESENTED TO THE ARRMC ED:

Based on interview, review of documentation in the medical records of 4 of 9 patients who presented to the ED for emergency services (Patients 8, 12, 17 and 19) and left AMA or LWBS, and review of policies and procedures it was determined that the hospital failed to fully develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that all patients were provided a complete and appropriate MSE, or that attempts were made to advise the patients of the risks of leaving before an MSE was completed.

Findings included:

1. The policy and procedure titled ""Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities,"" dated as revised ""03/2019"" was reviewed. It stipulated:

* ""Emergency Medical Condition - An Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) means: A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain and mental illness) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in:
	a. Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy;
	b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
	c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or parts ...""

* ""Procedure Medical Screening Examination - Medical Screening Examination (MSE) - is an exam completed by qualified medical personnel to determine whether or not an EMC or active labor exists. A MSE may represent a spectrum ranging from a simple process involving only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that involves performing ancillary studies and procedures. A complete and appropriate MSE will be performed on all individuals who come to the hospital requesting examination or treatment or attempts will be made to advise the patient of the risk of leaving before an MSE can be completed. An MSE will be completed regardless of an individual's ability to pay.""

* ""Qualified medical personnel who may be permitted to perform a MSE are defined as: Members with clinical privileges; and Registered Nurses ...""

* ""If a patient presenting to ED(s) or L&D/Perinatal department(s) and while waiting for medical screening decides to leave without examination (AMA/LWBS) the following steps should be taken if at all possible:
	a. Explain to the patient it is important to have the medical screening to rule out whether or not they have a medical condition that needs treatment;
	b. Use an interpreter if the patient has limited English proficiency, or use an alternate means of communication;
	c. Inform the patient of the risks of not having the medical screening;
	d. Ask the patient to sign the AMA form acknowledging they understand the risks of leaving without the medical screening;
	e. Document on the medical record the above information and if they refuse to sign the AMA, document that on the record as well.""

2. The ED medical record for Patient 8 reflected [he/she] (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2242 with a chief complaint of ""Abdominal pain."" The ED triage note at 2254 reflected ""Pt crying in triage. [Family] states [his/her] skin is red and pt has been in pain. Pt lwbs earlier this evening."" 
* At 0031 on 01/29/2019 an RN note reflected ""went out and spoke with family. States I hoped I could get their child back in the next 20 to 30 minutes. [Family] verbalized understanding."" 
* No documentation of a MSE was found in the medical record.
* At 0032 on 01/29/2019 a RN note reflected ""ED disposition set to AMA/LWBS."" There was no documentation in the record that the risks of not having a MSE were explained to the patient/family and a signed AMA form was not found or any documentation that the patient/family refused to sign the AMA form, per the hospital policy.
* There was no further documentation of the circumstances surrounding the patient leaving prior to receiving a MSE.

3. The ED medical record for Patient 12 reflected [he/she] (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2225 with a chief complaint of ""chest pain."" The ED triage note at 2226 reflected ""Past couple days pt has had chest pain, L shoulder pain, sob. States [he/she] has a hx of panic attacks, work has been adding stress. States this feels different than past attacks."" The patient was triaged and an EKG was done.
* At 2325 on 02/15/2019 an RN note reflected ""ED Dispostition set to LWBS after Triage."" 
* There was no documentation of the circumstances surrounding the patient leaving the ED prior to a MSE.
*Although the record reflected an EKG was done, there was no documentation that reflected further evaluation of the patient's medical condition or that a MSE had been completed. There was no documentation in the record that the risks of not having a MSE were explained to the patient and a signed AMA form was not found or any documentation that the patient refused to sign the AMA form, per the hospital policy.

4. The ED medical record for Patient 17 reflected [he/she] (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2319 with a chief complaint of ""vaginal pain."" The RNs ED triage note at 2340 reflected ""Awoke crying painful in [his/her] genitals, [family] tried warm and cool bath with no relief, [family] thinks there might be a scratch there and thought [he/she] saw a splinter.""

There was no documentation in the record that the risks of not having a MSE were explained to the patient/family and a signed AMA form was not found or any documentation that the patient/family refused to sign the AMA form, per the hospital policy.

5. The ED medical record for Patient 19 reflected [he/she] (MDS) dated [DATE] at 2209 with a chief complaint of ""pregnant and bleeding."" The RN ED triage note at 2217 reflected ""Patient states last period December 28th, bleeding for over a week with last two days large multiple clots and abd cramping. Patient has not had pre-natal care.""
* At 2354 a ED Physician ordered an OB ultrasound that was not completed.

* There was no documentation that reflected further evaluation of the patient's medical condition or that a MSE had been completed. There was no documentation in the record that the risks of not having a MSE were explained to the patient and a signed AMA form was not found or any documentation that the patient refused to sign the AMA form, per the hospital policy.

6. During interview with the QMC and EDM on 04/17/2019 at the time of the medical record review they confirmed findings 2, 3, 4 and 5 and stated that there was no other documentation in the medical records that reflected AMA forms were signed, that the patient/family refused to sign the form or that the patient had the risks explained about leaving prior to receiving a MSE.

Based on interview, review of documentation in 1 of 7 medical records of patients who were transferred from PPMC to another hospital for specialty services not available at PPMC at that time (Patient 22), and review of hospital policies and procedures and other documents, it was determined that the hospital failed to enforce its EMTALA policies and procedures to ensure that it affected appropriate transfers for patients for whom an EMC had not been ruled out, removed or resolved: 
* Physician certification of medical benefits vs risks was not documented.
* There was no documentation that available medical records were sent or transmitted to the receiving hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The policy and procedure ""Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities"" dated as last reviewed ""03/2018"" included the following definitions and ""Procedures:""
* ""For the purpose of this policy, an EMTALA patient is defined as any patient present in a facility's emergency department who has been stabilized within the limits of that facility's current capabilities or a patient present in a facility's emergency department who has not been stabilized and the patient is requesting the transfer, after being informed of the hospital's EMTALA obligations and the risks of transfer. The sending hospital takes precedence in determining if the patient is an EMTALA patient. Transfers of these patients are subject to EMTALA provisions.""
* ""Prior to transfer, an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient. Individualized risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and documented on the Patient Transfer Form or physician documentation in the medical record.""
* ""Stabilized patients may be transferred to another facility...if physician or qualified care provider certifies in writing that the benefits of transferring the patient to another facility outweigh the risk (See Attachment A - 'Patient Transfer Form.')."" 
* ""Accompanying records sent with patient...[ED] treatment record...Flow sheet(s)...Laboratory results...X-rays...Progress notes...""
* ""Documentation to occur on patient's chart...Records that accompanied patient...Explanation of benefits and risks are explained to patient/family.""

2. The ED record of Patient 22 was reviewed and reflected that the pregnant patient (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1111 following a MVA. The ""Obstetric Admission Note"" dated 06/21/2018 at 1632 by the CNM reflected that the patient received a MSE and ""Irregular uterine contractions...Plan transfer to LEMC for observation due to PTL symptoms/ ? Abruption at 34w4d and PPMC NICU on divert (pt elects transfer to avoid postpartum neonatal transfer if [he/she] delivers). [Discussed with LEMC Physician], who accepts pt transfer and agrees w/ plan of care. LEMC L&D notified...[Physician] recommended transfer and counseling upon arrival due to gestation [greater than] 34wk and dilation 3cm."" 

The ""Patient Transfer"" form dated and timed next to the physician's signature as 06/21/2018 at 1605 lacked individualized information about the reason for, and risks and benefits of transfer. The only documentation was in the form of a checkmark in a box next to ""Reason for Transfer:...Medically indicated"" and another checkmark in a box next to ""Summary of transfer benefits:...Obtain level of care/service not available at the facility."" Under the section for ""Summary of transfer risks"" there was no documentation. As required by this CFR and the PPMC policy referenced above there was no clear documentation of  ""...an explanation of the need to transfer and the alternative to transfer will be made to the patient. Individualized risks and benefits will be summarized verbally and documented on the Patient Transfer Form or physician documentation in the medical record.""

In addition, the section for ""Records sent with patient"" was blank. There was no documentation to reflect that the patient's available medical records were sent with the patient or were otherwise transmitted to the receiving hospital. 

3. During interview with the Maternity Department NM and L&D CN at the time of the record review on 07/18/2018 at 1110 they confirmed the lack of documentation in Patient 22's record.

Based on interview, review of central log and medical record documentation for 2 of 2 encounters of individuals who presented to the hospital for emergency services and did not receive an MSE (Patients 2 and 7), review of internal investigation documentation, review of medical staff rules and regulations, and review of policies and procedures, it was determined that the hospital failed to fully develop and enforce EMTALA policies and procedures that ensured that every individual who presented to the hospital for emergency services received an MSE within the capabilities and capacity of the hospital, and that hospital staff did or said nothing to dissuade patients from staying at the hospital for the provision of an MSE: 
* Patient 2 who presented to the hospital for emergency services left the hospital without receiving an MSE for reasons that were unexplained and without attempts to provide the patient with information about the risks of leaving, and without the patient signing an AMA form, in accordance with hospital P&Ps; and there was a lack of documentation that staff did or said nothing to dissuade the patient from staying at the hospital to be evaluated for an EMC.
* Patient 7 who presented to the hospital for emergency services for a head fracture and bleed did not receive an MSE as upon arrival the patient was directed by hospital staff that he/she should go to another hospital. 

Findings include:

1. The P&P titled ""Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Patient Transfers Between Facilities"" dated effective ""08/2019"" was reviewed and reflected:
* ""Emergency Medical Condition - An Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) means ... A condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain and mental illness) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in ... Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy ... Serious impairment to bodily function; or ... With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions, an EMC means ... That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or ... that transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child.""
* "" ... Triage does not constitute a Medical Screening Exam. Triage entails the clinical assessment of the individual's presenting signs and symptoms at the time of arrival at the hospital, or order to prioritize when the individual should be seen by a physician or other qualified medical personnel.""
* "" ... Medical Screening Examination (MSE) - is an exam completed by qualified medical personnel to determine whether or not an EMC or active labor exists. A MSE may represent a spectrum ranging from a simple process involving only a brief history and physical examination to a complex process that involves performing ancillary studies and procedures. A complete and appropriate MSE will be performed on all individuals who come to the hospital requesting examination or treatment or attempts will be made to advise the patient of the risk of leaving before an MSE can be completed ... ""
* "" ... If a patient presenting to ED(s) or L&D/Perinatal department(s) and while waiting for medical screening decides to leave without examination (AMA/LWBS) the following steps should be taken if at all possible ... Explain to the patient it is important to have the medical screening to rule out whether or not they have a medical condition that needs treatment ... Inform the patient of the risks of not having the medical screening ... Ask the patient to sign the AMA form acknowledging they understand the risks of leaving without the medical screening ... Document on the medical record the above information and if they refuse to sign the AMA, document that on the record as well.""

2. The medical staff rules and regulations titled ""Policies and Procedures Professional Staff Providence Health & Services - Oregon,"" dated as last revised 09/22/2019, was reviewed and reflected "" ... Medical Screening Examinations: Medical screening examinations will be performed on all individuals who come to the Hospital requesting examination or treatment to determine the presence of an emergency medical condition.""

3. a. The central log for Patient 2 reflected that he/she (MDS) dated [DATE] at 1834 with chief complaint of ""Headache - Adult New Onset."" The ED disposition on the log was recorded as ""LWBS after Triage.""

3. b. The medical record for Patient 2's 02/03/2020 encounter was reviewed and included:
* At 1834 ""Patient arrived in ED ... Arrival Complaint Headache.""
* At 1835 ""Registration Completed."" 
* At 1853, RN notes reflected ""Pain Body Location: head Pain Rating (0-10): Rest: 6 ... Chief Complaints Updated Headache (Adult - New Onset Or New Symptoms),"" and vital signs were recorded.
* At 1854, RN ""ED Triage Notes"" reflected ""PT to ER  w/ c/o HA. PT states 'I would like someone to look at my head (sic) I have been here before for the same thing ... ""
* At 1854, RN notes reflected "" ... Patient Acuity: 4.""
* At 1855, RN notes reflected ""Full Triage Complete.""
* At 1857, RN notes reflected ""Patient transferred From room EDWT room to EDWTFT.""
* The next RN notes, at 2057 reflected ""Patient dismissed ... ED Disposition set to LWBS after Triage ... ED AMA/LWBS ... ""
* An untimed entry under ""Disposition"" reflected ""LWBS after Triage ... PT states [he/she] wishes to leave. Would not wait to sign paperwork. PT advised to return if s/s worsened.""

The record contained:
* No documentation the patient received an MSE.
* No documentation staff explained or attempted to explain the importance of having a MSE to rule out whether or not he/she had a medical condition that needed treatment in accordance with hospital P&Ps.
* No documentation staff informed the patient of the risks of leaving prior an MSE in accordance with hospital P&Ps.
* No documentation staff asked the patient to sign an AMA form acknowledging he/she understood the risks of leaving without an MSE in accordance with hospital P&Ps. Although the record reflected the patient ""Would not wait to sign paperwork,"" there was no documentation that described what ""paperwork"" the patient would not wait to sign.
* No other documentation in the record related to the circumstances and reasons the patient wanted to leave prior to an MSE.
* There was a lack of documentation that hospital staff did or said nothing to dissuade the patient from staying at the hospital to be evaluated for an EMC.

3. c. During an interview and review of Patient 2's medical record with the EDM on 01/06/2021 at 1545, the EDM confirmed the medical record reflected:
* No documentation the patient received an MSE.
* No documentation the patient was evaluated by a physician or other LIP. 
* No documentation of labs or diagnostic testing.
* No documentation that an AMA form was completed or that the patient was informed of the risks of leaving without an MSE.

3. d. During an interview with the EDM and EDD on 01/19/2021 at 1555, they confirmed Patient 2's medical record contained no documentation that reflected the reason the patient left the hospital without an MSE. An opportunity to provide additional information related to the circumstances and reason the patient left without an MSE was provided. The EDM and EDD confirmed there was no other documentation or information that described the reason the patient left without an MSE. 

4. a. During an interview with the EDD on 10/27/2020 at 1620, the EDD provided the following information regarding an incident involving Patient 7:
* The PMMC ED CN got a phone call from an individual at the VA regarding Patient 7. The patient was at an outpatient appointment at the VA. The patient had a brain bleed and a possible skull fracture and VA staff had told the patient to go to PMMC ED for evaluation. 
* The PMMC ED CN told the PMMC ED physician the patient was coming to the PMMC ED. The PMMC ED physician said the patient ""shouldn't come here. We don't have any neurology.""
* The patient presented to PMMC ED by private vehicle with his/her spouse.
* The patient checked into registration.
* The PMMC ED CN went out to the ED lobby and told the patient he/she ""would likely have to transfer to ARRMC because PMMC did not have neurosurgery services.""
* The patient then left the PMMC and went to ARRMC for emergency services.
The EDD confirmed the patient presented to PMMC for emergency services, engaged in a conversation with the PMMC ED CN, and then left PMMC ED to go to another hospital for emergency services. The EDD confirmed PMMC did not triage Patient 7 or provide the patient an MSE to determine whether or not an EMC existed.  
* The EDD stated he/she did not know what the patient's condition was when he/she presented to the ED or when he/she left without an MSE.

4. b. During an interview on 10/27/2020 at 1340 with the QMC, the QMC indicated the hospital had conducted an investigation following the incident involving Patient 7. The report of that investigation titled ""EMTALA Concern SBAR,"" was provided and reviewed. The report reflected the incident occurred on 03/02/2020 at 2217 and included the following:
* ""A patient with a head injury was told by PMMC Charge RN (under direction of docs) to go to [ARRMC] and did not receive a MSE."" 
* "" ... A VA patient was sent here for a head fracture and bleed seen on CT earlier that day at the VA.""
* ""Investigation Findings Summary ... The VA believed this patient needed emergency care and instructed [him/her] to come to the PMMC ED ... patient arrived to PMMC and was registered in the ED when the charge RN had a conversation with [him/her] that led to [him/her] leaving PMMC and going over to RRMC ... The physician never saw the patient as [he/she] was not notified of the patient's arrival nor was [he/she] a part of the conversation between the RN and patient ... "" 
The report reflected that Patient 7 presented to the ED for emergency services including evaluation of a medical condition. Patient 7 left the hospital based on a conversation with the ED CN, and did not receive a MSE.

4. c. The hospital's central log included an entry for Patient 7 that reflected:
* ""Arrival Date ... 3/2/2020""
* ""Chief Complaint"" was blank.
* ""ED Attending"" was blank.
* ""Status ... Canceled""
* ""Disposition"" was blank.
* ""Diagnosis"" was blank.

4. d. An untitled EPIC document for Patient 7 was reviewed and reflected:
* ""Visit Information ... Arrival 03/02/2020 2217"" 
* ""Department ... Emergency Department""
* ""First Attending"" followed by a blank space. 
* ""Chief Complaint None""  
* ""ED Diagnosis None""
* ""ED Disposition None""
* ""ED Treatment Team None""

4. e. A ""Registration History Report"" for Patient 7 reflected:
* ""Registration History for the Patient Encounter"" followed by:
""3/2/2020 10:17 PM patient encounter created""
""3/2/2020 10:17 PM Visit hospital account assigned""
""3/2/2020 10:17 PM Visit account assigned""
""3/2/2020 10:17 PM Visit coverage assigned""

There were no other documents related to Patient 7's 03/02/2020 arrival and encounter at the hospital. There was no documentation that reflected Patient 7 was triaged or vital signs collected. There was no documentation that reflected the hospital provided an MSE to determine whether or not an EMC existed. This was confirmed during an interview with the EDM on 01/19/2021 at 1535.

The chart note summarizing the basis for the physician certification for the transfer must give a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time for the transfer...All sections of the Transfer Form must be completed prior to transfer of the patient and a copy of the form must be sent with the patient along with copies of the patient's medical record.""

A triage assessment performed by Registered Nurse (RN) #1 began on 9/14/2021 at 5:10 AM. RN #1 assigned Patient #1 an acuity level of 3. RN #1 documented Patient #1 had gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. RN #1 documented Patient #1's pain level as a 9, on a scale of 0-10 with 10 being the most severe. Patient #1's vital signs were as follows: temperature 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 111, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 172/96, and oxygen saturation level 99%. After triage, Patient #1 was taken to the waiting room. There was no documentation Patient #1's EMS assessment was discussed with a provider upon arrival to the hospital's ED or before the patient was placed in the waiting room.

An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed on 9/14/2021 at 6:10 AM which revealed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 91 and showed abnormal R-wave progression (common EKG reading which could suggest an old anterior myocardial infarction [heart attack]) , early transition, and probable left ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement and thickening of the walls of the heart's main pumping chamber). There was no documentation an ED provider was notified of the abnormal findings of the EKG. There was no documentation Patient #1 received treatment for these abnormal findings.

A lipase level was drawn on 9/14/2021 at 6:14 AM with a result of 69 units/liter and a reference range of 13-44. (Lipase is an enzyme primarily produced by the pancreas, and an elevated level may indicate injury to cells in the pancreas). An alkaline phosphatase level was drawn with a result of 125 international units/liter and a reference range of 32-92 (elevated level may indicate damage to the liver). A carbon dioxide level was drawn with a result of 19 millimoles/liter and a reference range of 22-28. There was no documentation the ED provider was notified of the lab results. There was no documentation Patient #1 received treatment for the abnormal lab results.
 
A chest x-ray was performed on Patient #1 on 9/14/2021 at 6:15 AM which revealed bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation, consistent with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in the lungs. Multiple surgical clips and many loops of gas-filled bowel were seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on the x-ray.

The ""Inpatient/Outpatient Conditions of Admission and Consent to Medical Treatment"" dated 6/14/2021 at 6:25 AM was signed by Patient #1. The ""Notice of Patient Rights and Responsibilities"" dated 9/14/2021 at 6:25 AM was not signed by Patient #1, and ""Unable to finish"" was handwritten in the blank for the patient's signature. The ""Notice of Communication Accessibility Services"" dated 9/14/2021 at 6:25 AM was not signed by Patient #1, and ""Pt [patient] unable to finish"" was handwritten in the blank for the patient's signature.

Patient #1 received a normal saline bolus of 1000 milliliters IV on 9/14/2021 at 7:24 AM in the hospital ED's waiting area.

Patient #1's vital signs were taken again on 9/14/2021 at 8:31 AM and were as follows: temperature 96 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 165/93, and oxygen saturation level of 99%.

There was no documentation Patient #1's heart rate greater than 100 was reassessed within 2 hours after the vital signs were taken at 5:10 AM or after the vital signs were taken at 8:31 AM.

There was no documentation of follow-up, assessment, examination, monitoring, or treatment related to Patient #1's pain.

Patient #1 left the Hospital ED on 9/14/2021 at 12:02 PM without being seen by a provider or receiving a MSE to determine if the patient had an emergency medical condition (7 hours and 3 minutes after arrival).

Medical record review for Patient #1 from Hospital #2 revealed Patient #1 presented to the Hospital #2 ED on 9/15/2021 at 8:49 PM with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Patient #1 was admitted     to Hospital #2 for further evaluation and management of acute pancreatitis.

In an interview on 10/12/2021 at 10:32 AM, the ED Nursing Director stated that Patient #1 was brought into the ED via EMS to the triage room and then taken out into the waiting room where she stayed until she left the hospital. The ED Nursing Director stated that staff made rounds on patients in the waiting room depending on patient acuity. The ED Nursing Director stated that staff get vital signs on patients in the waiting room every 2-4 hours, and the patient's pain level was assessed with the vital signs. There was no documentation Patient #1's elevated heart rate was monitored every 2 hours. There was no documentation Patient #1's pain was reassessed after the initial assessment on 9/14/2021 at 5:10 AM with a pain level of 9 on a 0-10 scale.

In a phone interview on 10/13/2021 at 7:45 AM, Nurse Practitioner #1 stated the ED has been experiencing extended wait times. Nurse Practitioner #1 stated that she performed psychiatric rounds at 3:00 AM and then went to the desk at the main ED area. Nurse Practitioner #1 stated there was only one physician and herself from then until her replacement arrived at 6:00 AM to manage patient care. Nurse Practitioner #1 stated she could not specifically remember Patient #1, but she put a note in on every patient she had seen (there was no note for Patient #1). Nurse Practitioner #1 stated that if a patient was having a problem, the nurses could come to her for an order. Nurse Practitioner #1 stated she would not give any IV pain medications to a patient out in the lobby but would consider PO pain medications or Toradol (ketorolac) given intramuscularly (IM). There was no documentation Patient #1's pain was reassessed during the time in the hospital ED's waiting room while waiting to be seen by a provider. 

In an interview on 10/13/2021 at 9:12 AM, the ED Medical Director stated when patients are out in the waiting room, the ED physicians have ordered Toradol to be given for patients in the waiting room who were experiencing severe pain. The ED Medical Director stated the ED tech would recheck vital signs on every patient depending on the patient acuity and would notify the triage nurse for any change or problem. There was no documentation Patient #1 received any reassessment of pain or received any medication for pain. 

In a phone interview on 10/13/2021 at 9:36 AM, RN #1 stated an ED tech or nurse was assigned to the waiting room to round on patients in the waiting room. RN #1 stated the ED nurses sometimes do give oral pain medications for patients out in the waiting room, but the patients had to be seen by a provider first.

In a phone interview on 10/13/2021 at 9:45 AM, Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) #1 stated she has been assigned to perform rounds on patients in the waiting room. LPN #1 stated she would get vital signs every 4 hours on patients who were assigned a level 3 acuity. LPN #1 stated she would report anything serious or any change in patient condition to the triage nurse.

In a phone interview on 10/13/2021 at 11:08 AM, Physician Assistant (PA) #1 stated the ED staff could not guarantee every patient would be seen by a provider within a certain time. PA #1 stated the providers would sometimes order acetaminophen or ibuprofen by mouth or Toradol IM for the patients in the waiting room who were experiencing severe pain.

In an interview on 10/13/2021 at 11:50 AM, the Patient Access Supervisor for the ED stated Patient #1 signed the consent to treat form but then told her she could not finish signing her paperwork. The Patient Access Supervisor for the ED stated she remembered Patient #1 because most patients do not stop signing paperwork in the middle and either sign all the paperwork or refuse to sign any of it. The Patient Access Supervisor for the ED stated she remembered Patient #1 was so sick and nauseated that she could not continue signing her paperwork.

The hospital failed to provide an appropriate and ongoing MSE, and failed to appropriately monitor Patient #1's nausea/vomiting and pain level before Patient #1 left the hospital on [DATE] at 12:02 PM (7 hours and 3 minutes after arrival).

3.  Medical record review for Patient #21 revealed the patient was a [AGE]-year-old female and arrived at the Hospital's ED on 9/13/2021 at 4:03 PM in a private vehicle. The patient's chief complaints were nausea, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea. RN #2 also documented as a chief complaint, that Patient #21 ""stated she can feel something crawling in her skin and seeds popped out of her skin.""

A triage assessment performed by RN #2 began on 9/13/2021 at 4:45 PM. RN #2 assigned Patient #21 an acuity level of 3. RN #1 documented Patient #1 had gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Patient #2's vital signs were as follows: temperature 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 17, blood pressure 191/102, and oxygen saturation level 95%. RN #2 documented Patient #21 was alert and oriented x 4 (person, place, time, and situation), but there was no documentation to address Patient #21's chief complaint that she could feel something crawling in her skin and seeds popping out of her skin.

Patient #21's vital signs were taken again on 9/13/2021 at 10:00 PM and were as follows: heart rate 72, blood pressure 173/107, and oxygen saturation level of 97%. There was no documentation provided that temperature, respiratory rate, or pain level was monitored.

There was no documentation Patient #21's vital signs were rechecked on 9/13/2021 from 4:45 PM to 10:00 PM (5 hours and 15 minutes) or were rechecked after 10:00 PM to the time she left the ED on 9/14/2021 at 4:26 AM (6 hours and 26 minutes).

There was no documentation Patient #21's abnormal blood pressure (191/102 at 4:45 PM and 173/107 at 10:00 PM) was rechecked every 2 hours or was addressed. There was no documentation Patient #21's abnormal blood pressure was communicated to the ED Provider.

There was no documentation of follow-up, assessment, examination, monitoring, or treatment related to Patient #21's diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or mental health status.

Patient #21 left the Hospital ED on 9/14/2021 at 4:26 AM without being seen by a provider or receiving a MSE to determine if the patient had an emergency medical condition (12 hours and 23 minutes after arrival).

In an interview on 10/13/2021 at 12:20 PM, the ED Nursing Director stated the ED staff member checking vital signs out in the lobby would receive an alert in the computer if the patient's systolic blood pressure was greater than 180 or the diastolic blood pressure was greater than 100. The ED Nursing Director stated the ED staff member should notify the ED physician if a patient's blood pressure exceeded the parameters and document the notification of the physician in the medical record.

The hospital failed to provide an appropriate and ongoing MSE, and failed to appropriately monitor and address Patient #21's abnormal blood pressure, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mental health status before Patient #21 left the hospital on [DATE] at 4:26 AM (12 hours and 23 minutes after arrival).
